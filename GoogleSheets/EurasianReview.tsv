Thailand: Time Runs Out For Justice In Tak Bai Massacre – Analysi...	By Don Pathan It was always a long shot but Malay Muslims in Thailand’s southern border region never gave up hope that the government would amend the criminal code to extend the 20-year statute of limitations in the infamousTak Bai massacre. They hoped that all 14 suspects, now retired government officials, could be brought to justice for the deaths of 85 unarmed protesters in Tak Bai on Oct. 25, 2004. The statute expired on Friday without any of the suspects being taken into custody, although there were warrants out for their arrest. During the past weeks, there were relentless demonstrations and seminars about the incident. These included a Senate hearing and a public protest in front of a military base in Yala province, where people demanded that the government amend the criminal code and demonstrate its commitment to justice. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and her Cabinet members sought comfort in the legal procedures, saying these requests must be examined thoroughly and that due process must be observed. While apologizing to victims’ relatives on Thursday, she said it would be constitutionally impossible to extend the statute of limitations in the Tak Bai case beyond Oct. 25. No one wanted to acknowledge the political underpinnings of the incident, or how the country’s justice system and international standing were at stake. Of the85 victims, seven were shot dead at the protest site. The rest suffocated to death while stacked up like logs in the back of military trucks, after being rounded up and detained. They were among nearly 1,400 demonstrators calling for the release of six village security personnel, who were accused by police of willingly handing their government-issued weapons to separatist insurgents. The massacre happened during the holy month of Ramadan, considered sacred by Muslims. Gen. Pisarn Wattanawongkiri, the region’s highest military commander who was at the demonstration site, was quickly reassigned. He would retire from the Royal Thai Army honorably some years later. Shortly after the killings, a shaky video clip of the incident circulated widely. It showed protesters being kicked and struck with the butts of rifles, as they were forced to crawl into the trucks. The message to them and to the Malay Muslims, who make up about 85% of the 2 million residents of this historically contestedregion, was clear: You’re a defeated people, and there isn’t much you can do but learn how to live with this reality; don’t forget that challenging the authorities comes with a heavy price. The message was rejected outright, of course. The Tak Bai massacre became part of a powerful narrative, not only for the local Malay Muslims because it reinforced their historical mistrust of the Thai state, but for the separatist insurgents who would use it in their recruitment drive. In what was billed as a gesture of goodwill, then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra launched a 'peace bombing' campaign to assuage the fury of the Malays in the border region. He asked the country’s people to fold origami birds, which were dropped from the military planes across the far south. Collecting 20 paper cranes entitled one to a carton of milk. Despite the intention, the peace bombings baffled both the militants and the Muslims, who offered an entirely different interpretation of the birds. The Islamic understanding of dropping birds is battle, the late opposition MP Surin Pitsuwan, a Muslim, told the Parliament floor. He pointed to Sura 105 of the Quran, (Al-Fil, the Elephant), in which God sends down 'birds in flocks' on his enemies to flatten them like blades of grass. Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, who was installed by a junta after Thaksin was toppled in a 2006 coup, apologized to the family members of the Tak Bai victims during a town hall meeting in Pattani province in 2007. But the Thai state and society didn’t feel the need to build on Surayud’s apology. There was no public monument or official event to commemorate the tragic event. In May 2009, the Songkhla Provincial Court ruled that security officials who were sent to break up the Tak Bai protest had acted within their duties, and that 78 of the victims had died from suffocation. In other words, they died as a result of unfortunate circumstances rather than intentional acts. Nothing was said about the seven others who were shot dead on site. In 2012, the then-government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra – Thaksin’s younger sister – provided compensation of7.5 million baht (U.S. $ 222,028) to thefamiliesof each of the victims. However, financial compensation was not the same as justice, no matter how hard the Thai officials and Thaksin’s political allies wanted it to be. This past August and September, a Thai court decided to try the cases and bring murder charges against 14 men, from military Gen. Pisarn to the drivers of the transport trucks. For some it was a chance for justice; for others, it was an opportunity for closure, to heal the wound and move on as a nation. The militants had resurfaced in mid-2001, after a decade-long hiatus. But their presence was not officially recognized by Thaksin’s government until they pulled off a major arms heist from a military weapons depot in Narathiwat province, where Tak Bai is located, in January 2004. Twenty years later, more than 7,500 people have been killed from insurgency-related violence, and the end is still nowhere in sight despite several attempts at negotiations with the rebels. Peace initiatives have never moved beyond confidence-building measures. With the military and conservative establishment in a firm place after a Faustian deal with the ruling Pheu Thai Party, the peace negotiation is likely to be even more difficult than in the past. As the 20th anniversary of the incident approached, violence in the far southspiked. But this year’s attacks were much more vicious, perhaps because the statute of limitations in the Tak Bai incident was going to expire, and because separatist militants needed to remind the country – particularly Thai security forces in the heavily militarized Deep South – the case was far from being closed. Today’s ruling party, the Pheu Thai, an offshoot of Thai Rak Thai, is headed by 38-year-old Thaksin’s daughter, Paetongtarn. Pisarn became a senior member of the party and an MP until his resignation on Oct. 14, seemingly to distance the ruling party from the case. Like others who have been charged by the Thai court in August, Pisarn is nowhere to be found. The same could be said about national reconciliation. Don Pathan is a Thailand-based security analyst.

Factors Underlying Sino-Indian Rapprochement At BRICS – Analysis	India's disillusionment with the West, its need for Chinese investments and China's opening its doors to Indian tycoon and Modi acolyte Gautam Adani account for the change. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a very significant bilateral meeting on October 23 on the side lines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's summit in Kazan, Russia. Both leaders signalled a breakthrough in the long-drawn out and tortuous negotiations on ensuring peace on the troubled 3,000 km border between the two countries. Speaking at a think tank in New Delhi, after Kazan summit, India's Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh, said that the two countries have reached a broad consensus to restore the ground situation based on principles of equal and mutual security. The new agreement allows Indian forces to resume patrolling in key areas such as Depsang and Demchok that had been flashpoints in the India-China standoff on the 3,000 km border. The resumption of patrolling opens areas for Indian herdsmen to take their flock for grazing, a major demand of people on the Indian side of the border. Although the deal does not amount to 'disengagement' as such, it is an arrangement which will lessen friction on the ground, allow the two countries to discuss de-escalation and disengagement, and hopefully go for demarcation of the border in course of time. Experts said that the resumption of these activities is a confidence-building measure and a signal that both countries are willing to reduce military tensions. According to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, continuous dialogue had paid dividends. Surprise for Most To most observers in India and abroad, the deal, however small, came as a surprise as the prevailing wisdom is that India and China are such incorrigible rivals that even the smallest detente is inconceivable. But economic compulsions and geopolitical developments combined to shape events in favour of a détente In 2020, in Galwan Valley, 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed as the two sides fought ferociously with clubs and stones. This unusual clash led to a marked deterioration in Sino-Indian relations. India banned many Chinese consumer products including Tik Tok. But all the bitterness appears to have disappeared into thin air and euphoria is the order of the day. A combination of diverse factors such as India's growing disillusionment with the West, its need for Chinese investments and China's opening its doors to Indian tycoon and Modi acolyte, Gautam Adani, account for the change. Geopolitical Dimension To take the geopolitical dimension first: India's relations with the Western bloc, particularly US and Canada, had hit stumbling blocks. India did not back the West's case against the Russian attack on Ukraine. On the contrary, it bought crude oil from sanctioned Russia at a concessional rate, refined it, and made money by selling it to energy-starved Western Europe. An angry US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, told an audience in Kolkata that he does not think that India and the US are friends. Friends, he said, come to each other's help when one of them is in need. India's hadn't come to Ukraine's aid at a time of distress.Before Garcetti's admonition, US foreign policy expert Dr. Ashley Tellis, wrote a paper urging Washington not to count on India, because India takes a lot from the US, especially sophisticated defence equipment, but does not reciprocate. In American eyes, India's bid to exercise 'strategic autonomy' while being a 'strategic partner' of the US, is not on. More recently, the US, Canada and India have been at odds over an alleged Indian government involvement in the killing of a Sikh Canadian, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil, and an attempt to kill an American Sikh Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US. Nijjar and Pannun have been campaigning for the secession of a part of India to form an independent Sikh state of Khalistan. For the US and Canada, any Indian official involvement in the assassination of Nijjar or the attempt on the life of Pannun, is unacceptable, an invasion of their sovereignty. India not only denied any official involvement in the two cases, but accused Canada and the US of disregarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity and brazenly mollycoddling known terrorists and separatists. Though talks are on about the matter, an understanding is not on the cards, as of now. India and US are at odds over foreign policy with India not wanting to go against Russia or fight a war with China as the US desires. With the result, New Delhi is reaffirming its ties with Moscow and is making overtures to China. While Russia has an unbroken history of close of ties with India, China is shedding its antagonism to India. It has been showing interest in economic cooperation with India putting the intractable border issue on the backburner. And India appears to be shedding its stance that there can be no normalization of ties so long as the border is tense. Economic Factor India's need to develop its industry is pushing it to have closer ties with China and shedding some of its fears about Chinese infiltration and sabotage. A rather embarrassing fact for India is that its key industries are heavily dependent on Chinese intermediaries. According to economists Biswajit Dhar and K.S Chalapati Rao, India's depends on China for the supply of a wide range of products, from the simplestlike nails/tacks and umbrellas to sophisticated telecom and electronics products, and pharmaceutical intermediates called Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API). Chinese domination in the import of telecom and electronic products has increased manifold over the past few years after the Indian government initiated the Digital India programme in 2015. Chinese APIs have helped Indian generic manufacturers provide cheap medicines not only in Indians but to many abroad in both the developing and developed worlds. Due to its deep penetration in the global markets, the India has acquired the name 'Pharmacy of the World'. Large volumes of mobile phones are sourced from China. In 2019–20, more than 83% of imports of mobile phones were of Chinese origin. Nearly 90% of colour TV sets imported into the country were from China. India continues to depend substantially on imports of Chinese telecom transmission equipment. The motorcycle industry sourced 85% of its imports of parts and components from China in 2018-19. While most motorcycle components are obtained locally, India imports critical parts like wheel rims from China. India is heavily dependent on China for solar photovoltaic cells. More than 90% of imports of silicon wafers and solar lanterns in 2019–20 were from China. To support the production of Indian textiles and garments, another important export industry, India has been ramping up imports of yarn and fabric from China. Even the automobile industry — considered a success story for both domestic and export sales — has been increasing its imports of vehicle parts and accessories from China.India had made significant strides in producing solar panels but now relies even more on the Chinese solar cells that go in them. No wonder then that China is India's largest trading partner. Bid for Chinese FDI In July, India's Chief Economic Adviser Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran said that to boost global exports India should either integrate into China's supply chain or promote FDI from China. India has already been allowing Chinese companies o invest, albeit on a case by case basis. It has also been allowing minority share-holding in some companies and relaxing visa rules for Chinese experts. Nagewaran was keen on reducing the adverse trade balance with China which was US$ 83.36 in 2023. Adani's a Critical Entry On China's part, it has done something significant to clinch issues with India. In September, it allowed the Adani Global Pte, a Singapore-based subsidiary of Adani Enterprises owned by Gautam Adani, to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary, Adani Energy Resources (Shanghai), with a registered share capital of U$ 2.1 million. AERCL was incorporated and registered under the Company Law ofChina on September 2, 2024. This was a month before Prime Minister Modi was to meet Xi Jinping in Kazan, smile and shake hands. With a Modi acolyte like Adani having a stake in China's economy, economic relations between the twocountries will be on a sound footing, and that in turn, will lay the foundation for a strong political relationship.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-23v5mJBMBbC	2024-10-26T16:53:01-07:00	
Beyond Borders: How Iran’s Internal Repression Fuels Regional Con...	The news of Maryam Akbari Monfared's extended sentence was deeply shocking this week. A mother of three daughters, Maryam was arrested while putting her 4-year-old daughter to bed. Now, after 15 years of imprisonment without a single day of furlough, she has been transferred from Semnan Prison, where she was in exile, to Qarchak Prison in Varamin—an infamous facility known for its harsh conditions. Maryam's only 'crime' is her relentless pursuit of justice and accountability for the unjust executions of her siblings in 1980s as political prisoners in Iran. Maryam’s courage in seeking justice for her family has made her a target of ongoing persecution by the regime. The Iranian regime has long used violence as a tool to suppress dissent and maintain its hold on power. Recent months have seen an unprecedented surge in executions, with over 500 reported in 2024 alone. This includes the execution of more than 300 prisoners since the inauguration of the new president, Pezeshkian, in August. The regime has carried out executions at an alarming rate. These executions serve as a method of silencing political opposition and dissent within the country, reminiscent of the 1988 massacre when 30,000 political prisoners were executed. As internal protests grow and international pressures mount, Tehran’s response has been to increase its use of the death penalty as a means of instilling fear and control. Externally, Iran’s aggressive foreign policy exacerbates conflicts throughout the Middle East. By financing, training, and arming proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen, and Iraq, the regime fuels regional instability. Senior Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, have openly admitted that Iran's involvement in these conflicts serves to distract from the regime's internal struggles. Khamenei has stated, 'If we do not fight in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen, and Iraq, we will have to fight in Tehran.' This clear admission underscores the regime's strategy of exporting conflict to prevent domestic unrest. Iran's foreign interventions serve to distract the international community from its severe human rights violations at home. The humanitarian crisis within Iran, marked by the systematic repression of its population, is too often overshadowed by the focus on regional conflicts. Despite the severity of these crises, effective international action has been hindered by geopolitical considerations and misinformation propagated by the Iranian regime. Global powers have been reluctant to confront Tehran out of fear of further destabilising the region. Additionally, the regime’s efforts to delegitimise opposition groups have been somewhat effective in diverting attention from its own abuses. However, international bodies such as the United Nations have voiced strong opposition to Iran’s increasing use of executions. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and various UN thematic mandate holders, including the Special Rapporteur on Iran, Professor Javaid Rehman, have condemned the surge in executions, calling on Tehran to halt these unlawful acts. The joint statement issued by the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand also highlights the regime’s brutal repression of women, girls, and political activists. UN experts have described Iran’s executions as unlawful, pointing to serious violations of fair trial and due process rights and urged Iran to immediately halt the use of the death penalty. In response to the crisis, political prisoners in Iran have initiated the 'No to Executions Tuesdays' campaign, which has gained traction in 22 prisons across the country. This campaign, in its 39th consecutive week, protests the regime's widespread use of executions as a political tool. Additionally, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), led by President-elect Maryam Rajavi, has launched a global campaign against executions. The campaign has received support from 1,500 prominent personalities across 78 countries, including parliamentarians, former presidents, and Nobel Prize winners. The global community must act decisively to address both Iran’s internal repression and its destabilising activities in the Middle East. To address the escalating human rights crisis in Iran, it is crucial to establish an international accountability process that holds the regime responsible for its unlawful executions and crimes against humanity. Iran's human rights record should be referred to the International Criminal Court or an international tribunal to ensure justice for victims of these atrocities. These demands must also be included in the UN General Assembly’s annual resolution on Iran, calling for urgent action. Additionally, cooperation with the main Iranian opposition, NCRI, and activists who are campaigning for accountability is essential to amplify the global response. Imposing sanctions on Iran’s leaders and senior officials responsible for human rights violations will further pressure the regime. Finally, diplomatic relations with Iran should be severed until the regime halts executions and releases all political prisoners. The situation in Iran is urgent, and the risk of another massacre is real. Without decisive international intervention, the cycle of repression and violence will continue, both within Iran and across the region. The global community must take action to stop the executions and hold the Iranian regime accountable for its crimes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-78ond_4ajfq	2024-10-26T16:51:00-07:00	
Institutionalized Statism And India’s Social Fabric – OpEd	India, once celebrated as a secular and pluralistic society, is increasingly becoming a nation defined by religious intolerance and communal divisions. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership, Hindutva, the political ideology advocating for Hindu dominance, has gained unprecedented momentum. This shift has disproportionately affected India’s Muslim population, leading to systematic discrimination, state-backed violence, and social exclusion. The rise of such policies threatens India’s secular framework and has triggered global concerns about the erosion of human rights and minority safety in the world's largest democracy. In the past decade, Modi's government has systematically implemented policies that marginalize Indian Muslims, portraying them as outsiders within their own country. Two Indian states, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, recently passed a policy mandating that restaurants publicly display the names of all their employees. While seemingly innocuous, this policy has been viewed with concern by Muslim business owners, who fear it will result in targeted attacks, economic boycotts, and even violence by extremist Hindu groups that operate in these states. These fears are not unfounded. The increasing influence of Hindutva has empowered hardline groups to enact mob violence, often with little to no government intervention. Modi's administration has promoted laws and policies that disproportionately target Muslims and other religious minorities, including Christians, Sikhs, and Dalits. Religious conversions, interfaith relationships, the wearing of the hijab, and even the slaughter of cows have all been restricted under the guise of 'protecting Hindu values.' Such measures not only embolden Hindu extremists but also deepen social divisions, undermining India's foundational principle of secularism. Economic boycotts against Muslims have become a disturbing trend in India. In states like Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, Muslim business owners face systematic exclusion from the economy, with calls from extremist groups urging Hindus to refrain from buying goods from Muslim-owned businesses. These boycotts are a powerful tool of economic disenfranchisement and create a climate of fear and isolation. The situation worsened with policies like the employee disclosure mandate, which provides extremists with an easy means to identify and target Muslim workers and businesses. Moreover, Muslim exclusion from housing in Hindu-majority areas, particularly in states like Gujarat, has led to modern-day apartheid-like conditions. In some communities, Muslim single mothers have been denied housing based on their religion, illustrating the depth of institutionalized discrimination that exists today. These acts of exclusion are not just societal but are often state-sponsored, as seen in the repeated demolitions of mosques and Muslim shrines under the guise of development projects. One of the most visible forms of oppression against Indian Muslims is the targeted demolition of mosques, shrines, and dargahs. Between 2015 and 2024, several Muslim religious structures were demolished across India, including remnants of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the Ahmad Shah Masjid in Ahmedabad, and multiple shrines in Delhi and Gujarat. The reasons cited by the authorities range from urban development to anti-encroachment drives, but the pattern of destruction is too consistent to ignore. Beyond economic and social exclusion, violence against Indian Muslims has escalated under Modi’s tenure. The aggressive rise of the Hindutva agenda has emboldened religious extremists to commit atrocities with impunity. One particularly concerning instance was when BJP member Gyan Dev Ahuja openly incited violence by advocating for the killing of individuals involved in cow slaughter—an issue that has become a flashpoint for religious tensions. This violent rhetoric is reflected in a spike in communal clashes across India. The Washington-based India Hate Lab (IHL) reported that in 2023, there were nearly two anti-Muslim hate speech events per day, with 75% of these events occurring in BJP-ruled states. Coupled with the state's failure to intervene or punish perpetrators, this has created an environment where mob violence is increasingly normalized, especially against Muslims and other religious minorities. Yet, despite this global attention, the Modi government continues to push policies that further marginalize minorities. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) were introduced with the clear aim of disenfranchising Indian Muslims. In Assam alone, over 700,000 Muslims are at risk of losing their citizenship, exacerbating fears of statelessness and mass displacement. The rise of Hindutva under Modi's regime has created an increasingly hostile environment for India’s Muslim population, with violence, discrimination, and exclusion becoming the norm. As these policies continue to unravel the fabric of India’s secular identity, it is imperative that the international community holds the Indian government accountable for its actions. Economic boycotts, mosque demolitions, and state-backed violence against religious minorities are not merely domestic issues—they are violations of human rights that demand global scrutiny and action. If left unchecked, the Hindutva agenda threatens not only India’s Muslims but the stability and unity of the nation as a whole.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-yioGVfn5rsF	2024-10-26T16:45:50-07:00	
The Challenges Of Managing An Educational Institution Of Higher L...	In this wide-ranging interview, Associate Professor Elisée Byelongo Isheloke, Rector/Vice Chancellor of Université Espoir du Congo (UEC), narrates his experiences of managing an educational institution from scratch, its embryo stage in many ways and with zero-capital, little support and a myriad of challenges. Despite the existing difficulties and challenges, the UEC is steadily becoming a regional powerhouse of knowledge, research and development. The UEC administration will also appreciate any form of assistance and support from external sources. Here are the interview excerpts: What are the peculiarities of managing an educational institution of higher learning, Hope University of Congo which is located in a small town of Baraka, in central Africa? Byelongo Elisee Isheloke: First of all, I would like to greet you and your viewers/readers on this day and thank you for having me on this platform. Now, to answer your question, there are a number of challenges in managing any University, let alone a young one like the 'Université Espoir du Congo' (UEC) also known as the 'Hope University of Congo' with very limited infrastructure and a myriad of challenges. To name but a few, the peculiarities stem from a variety of factors such as the lack of operational funding, inappropriate infrastructure and the (endemic) insufficient registered students. Most people in the small town of Baraka still send their children to bigger cities for their education. Although I do not entirely condemn this act, I would like to urge the community members to support this tailor-made community University in its mission to address some of the challenges of the very community as so far as education is concerned. The UEC is the only University of Fizi which is entirely based in that territory – with only one branch in Kamituga (Fizi is a territory of an area of 41 745 km2 which is bigger than that of the neighbouring country of Burundi or Ruanda). Although there are a few other Higher Learning Institutions, the UEC had been conceived to cater for the academic needs of Fizi-Itombwe with its five faculties, namely Economics, Law, Social, Political and Administrative Sciences (SSPA in French acronym) or six if one dares to add the Faculty of Languages, Interlinguistics and Esperanto which is still on its embryo stage in many ways. In cities like Bukavu and Lubumbashi, Universities started small and developed into greatness and maturity over the years. I understand that most of those used resources from the state to develop but there are instances in the Great Lakes region where community Universities outperformed public ones in many regards. In my view, the UEC is not following a strange path per se, what is strange though, is the attitude towards it taken by not only 'the elites' who live in or have roots within but even by the people who were supposed to hold it dearly. It is time this attitude changes in favour of one which is going to mobilize resources, provide capabilities and get more involvement with research and development; one which is going to allocate funds to build, manage and strengthen this University, the 'UEC'. For now, what would you count as the marked achievements during the past few years, despite the fact that the university has a short history? BEI: The university had its years of glory when a lot of funding were allocated to its administration by the Free Methodist Church and when the Faculty of Theology had some bursaries for registered students supported from the United States of America (USA). At that time, many professors came from abroad and the region to lecture and do a number of initiatives with the aim of giving the population of this territory a better chance to education. It will be remembered that Fizi is a war-torn territory owing to more than two decades of war, conflicts in the eastern DRC where the UEC is based, and an aftermath characterized by relative security or the lack thereof. The population of Fizi deserves better and needs access to better education in their own territory and this should allow interactions to take place between the people of Fizi-Itombwe and other indwellers who have come to Fizi for socio-economic reasons and are now part and parcel of our destiny. To answer your question more directly, the UEC has formed many cadres now deployed in many state institutions. Alumni include the sector chief, education prefects, bankers, magistrates, lawyers, teachers, religious superintendents, pastors, agriculturalists, economists, political analysts, esperantists, businessmen and businesswomen, entrepreneurs, Engineers and many other cadres who play a vital role in the socio-economic, development and political spheres, not only of the territory, but also that of the entire country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Do students, in other words, your clients recognized the educational curriculum (quality education) useful in the current competitive labor market in central Africa? BEI: There is no doubt about it because a year or two ago the government published a list of viable institutions in the entire DRC. The UEC came out as one of those viable institutions recognized on national scale. This goes without saying that the diplomas, degrees and certificates issued by UEC are equal to those issued by the University of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi or Bukavu, to name but a few. Some of our graduates have been employed as magistrates by the state. There is therefore no reason to turn away this important institution of education. When I took office as the Rector of UEC, I led my team in conducting a number of reforms which have also visibly make UEC impactful in the society. The human capital is one of those cornerstone achievements under my leadership. I have also managed to bring a few professors to volunteer as academics, deans, professors, assistant lecturers, fund-raisers, technical advisers and prayer-warriors in favour of the UEC. We have academics who joined in different initiatives from Africa, Italy, India, Spain, France, the USA and so forth. We managed to introduce reforms, under my stewardship, such as enhancing the quality of education through improved training by suitably qualified professors, assistant lecturers, the provision of technology, solar panels, Wifi, and the reception of new books from France, in the past and recently, mainly from the USA. The last donation of almost four hundred books from the Emeritus Professor Denis Aliko Songolo made history, making the UEC library an institution with very important written books – a treasure to be cherished for many more years. I managed to reschedule that all major transactions be done through a local bank and organized many conferences and events to enhance the culture of reading, researching and engaging in meaningful as well as robust debates about all aspects of life. Briefly, I managed to give to the university more international exposure in America, Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia; all this with the support of my team. Last but not least, my aim is also to promote the culture, social cohesion and collaboration among the people, within and beyond the community. To do this, we started to organize the Faculty of Language, InterLinguistics and Esperanto which apart from teaching other African languages next to imported ones, namely Mandarin, English, French, Esperanto, it will particularly promote and defend the use of Ebembe, Kiswahili and the likes – previously disadvantaged African languages. This will not only restore our dignity as the people of that territory but will also affirm our determination to a more equal society where linguistic human rights and indigenous knowledge of culture and science will be preserved and shared. What competitive advantages has Hope University of Congo over other similar educational institutions in the region? BEI: To go straight to the point, I would say the UEC has now the biggest library in the entire Fizi territory. The library which is yet to be built to the desired standard already has more books than any other in Fizi-Itombwe. If we manage to make my dream of building new facilities for the library, and later on for the UEC, it will become a milestone achievement of all the time. The community University namely UEC places at the centre of its policy the preservation of this community core values, traditions and culture, its languages Ebembe, Kiswahili as well as others and the sharing of science and technology through the use of other means of communication. It was initially meant to be a bilingual University (French and English) but evolved to accommodate other medium of communication including Esperanto, although it is in this regard that capacity need to be reinforced with infrastructure, volunteers, funding, bursaries and win-win partnerships. Science and technology remain two weaknesses of UEC owing to the lack of investors and regardless of entrepreneurial activities we have undertaken in the past. I appeal to the world to join us in this vision. A university like the UEC is destined to be a catalyst of peace in that slowly recovering region. If we get funding for entrepreneurship incubators, we could make UEC an economic hub of that semi-rural territory of Fizi. Beyond competition, I believe we could extend access to our library to sister Higher Learning institutions such as the Institut Supérieur Pédagogique (ISP Baraka), Institut Supérieur de Développement Rural (ISDR Baraka), Institut Supérieur de Technique Médical (ISTM Baraka) to name but a few. Where we could help we will not hesitate to do so in order to serve others with our library, sharing of knowledge, know-how through research products and beyond. Please help us build and further develop the library. We have managed to bring professors and other academics to join us in shaping the future of this University project. The likes of Emeritus Prof Denis Aliko Songolo, Prof Majaliwa Mwanjalolo, Prof Nehemie Mwilanya, Prof Extraordinary Badar Iqbal, P.O Hon. Obedi Nyamangyoku, Prof Renato Corsetti, Prof Vicente Manzano-Arrondo, Ir. Ahmed Mamdoohi, Dr. Jean Sikatenda, Rev. Nana Yenga, Mrs. Francoise Noireau, Mr. Yamungu Yamalong Boniface, Mr. Jérémie Mahungo, Mr. Kester Kenn Klomegah and many more, team up in support to our vision to make the UEC a regional powerhouse of knowledge, research and development. While some of them lecture physically or virtually, others either support/ed with donations, books, vehicle, Ruforum bursaries procedure, visits, lobbying, conferences, advocacy, fundraising and most importantly with technical advise to the office of the Vice-Chancellor that I hold. What has been the most difficult challenge running this university? And what management styles do you disagree with especially as head of this institution? BEI: The lack of funding is number one problem of this young University. We need funding to pay (decent) salaries to employed staff and visiting professors/Assistants, run the University, support research, equip with infrastructure, promote discoveries, use the 45 hectares of land that we have for agriculture and/or tree planting, nature conservation, and manage developmental projects. As a community University, we could use financial resources to intervene where necessary in the suburbs, villages where the Lake Tanganyika water rise effect impacted so negatively to the housing facilities, standard of living and life in general in Fizi territory and beyond. A proper operational budget coupled with reforms that I am conducting would take this university to another level of service to the community. If for example industrial fishing, research and development are promoted via the UEC which is (relatively) at the shore of the Lake Tanganyika, it can become a hub of economic development and job creation in the region. I adopted an open door policy in managing the UEC and I therefore do not agree with the autocratic leadership style. I treasure excellence in doing work and want to steer my colleagues to follow my example. I don't agree with insubordination in any way. Some say entrepreneurship is very challenging, but what keeps you motivated as a rector? Who are some of the most notable people that have experienced during the work of Hope University of Congo? BEI: I taught entrepreneurship and business economics to the university community and around Fizi and I am prepared to do so hoping to get people and organizations to extend some form of support. Fizi should not depend on handouts from NGOs instead I suggest an economic model similar to that of China where community development is catered for, supported, and developed through a bottom up approach at times with top down support most of the time; so that we teach the people to fish more efficiently, to cultivate the land, to work with their hands and brain, hard and smartly, to preserve the environment, recycle, reuse, reorient our inputs/outputs, promote own literature, fight corruption and mismanagement of funds, embrace the culture of saving and maintenance, promote peace and stability, build on faith, educate on good governance and so forth. I have been inspired by our leaders. The former Bishop Welongo Wehusha who saw the need to start off the UEC and the current Bishop Dr Lubunga Wehusha whom I believe to hold dear the idea of taking this University to another level and provide it with the necessary support as I lead it to a phase of ambitious project of greatness. As I said before, I also met many professors both in the country and abroad willing to do more to help. I should say the team efforts of those who sacrifice their time to work with me in Baraka or from wherever they are, I say thank you so much. I think of people who work/ed as security guards, librarian, cleaner, assistants, professors, office bearers, and appreciate their contribution which makes it possible to hope for a better future. I pray and work that we will one day have funding to rewards and recognize their efforts. Serving and working in the DRC and at the UEC for me it is in a way giving back to the country of origin and my people. It keeps me going. Having survived the atrocities of the war in that region, I think the people deserve better. It will all start with a better education to change the course of their life. After 26 years in South Africa, I am equipped to do something to change the world around me. With benefactors' support, I believe that I will make it happen. How do you value education and training for staff, as well as regular educational exchanges, as a means of forging relations with external universities (international cooperation) here? BEI: I think the UEC must be a learning organisation. We need to provide continuous training and cater for career development. We are not doing enough although during my term I am trying it. I have conducted not less than five conferences/workshops and invited other academics to do so but over the years we need more capacity, volunteers, missionaries, investors, authors, engineers, economists, business analysts, educationalists, scientists, researchers, esperantists, philosophers to join me in doing capacity building, training and more. The major partnerships we forged so far is that with Université Catholique de Bukavu (UCB), with Civencia (Spain) although in both instances we ought to materialize the agreement with practical initiatives. I am willing to steer my team in this regard going forward. I invite people with resources and the will to support me and get involved. We need well established universities to kindly provide bursaries and training opportunities to both our staff and students, invite us for joint venture initiatives, and we are willing to have twin relations with other universities abroad. Please let us know if you are reading me and could help with this. Where would you like to see this business of education, at least, in the next five years? In other words, what's your future vision for Hope University of Congo? BEI: I would like to see a modern library built and then after the rest of the infrastructure for the UEC. I will reveal later the name of it when the project starts. The UEC must grow into becoming a modern University with all the facilities; it can be a unifying force that call for peace and stability in the Great Lakes region. If developed into a full-fledged University, it will have the muscles to fully call for social cohesion, security, people to people relations, peace and cater for community development, culture preservation, environment conservation, research and development, publications, natural medicine, medicinal plants, multilingualism, food security, breeding of cows and other animals, controlled hunting, that put the spirit of Ubuntu, this African philosophy of humanity and generosity, at the centre of our core values. I thank you for the opportunity and the readers for their time, especially, those who will extend a hand of support to the University project that I have. God bless you!	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-71DST6wfYfo	2024-10-26T16:43:04-07:00	
Crippling UNRWA: The Knesset’s Collective Punishment Of Palestini...	The man has a cheek. Having lectured Iranians and Lebanese about what (and who) is good for them in terms of rulers and rule (we already know what he thinks of the Palestinians), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been keeping busy on further depriving access and assistance to those in Gaza and the West Bank. This comes in draft legislation that would prevent the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from pursuing its valuable functions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The campaign against UNRWA by the Israeli state has been relentless and pathological. Even before last year’s October 7 attacks by Hamas, much was made of the fact that the body seemed intent on keeping the horrors of the 1948 displacements current. Victimhood, complained the amnesiac enforcers of the Israeli state, was being encouraged by treating the descendants of displaced Palestinians as refugees. Nasty memories were being kept alive. Since then, Israel has been further libelling and blackening the organisation as a terrorist front best abolished. (Labels are effortlessly swapped – 'Hamas supporter'; 'activist'; 'terrorist'.) Initially came that infamous dossier pointing the finger at 12 individuals said to be Hamas participants in the October 7 attacks. With swiftness, the UN commenced internal investigations. Some individuals were sacked on suspicion of being linked to the attacks. Unfortunately, some US$450 million worth of donor funding from sixteen countries was suspended. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini was always at pains to explain that he had 'never been informed' nor received evidence substantiating Israel’s accusations. It was also all the more curious given that staff lists for the agency were provided to both Israeli and Palestinian authorities in advance. At no point had he ever 'received the slightest concern about the staff that we have been employing.' In April, Lazzarini told the UN Security Council that 'an insidious campaign to end UNRWA’s operations is under way, with serious implications for peace and security'. Repeatedly, requests by the agency to deliver aid to northern Gaza had been refused, staff barred from coordinating meetings between humanitarian actors and Israel, and UNRWA premises and staff targeted. Israel’s campaign to dissuade donor states from restoring funding proved a mixed one. Even the United Kingdom, long sympathetic to Israel’s accusations, announced in July that funding would be restored. In the view of UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, UNRWA had taken steps to ensure that it was meeting 'the highest standards of neutrality.' In August, the findings of a review of the allegations by former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, instigated at the request of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, were released. It confirmed UNRWA’s role as 'irreplaceable and indispensable' in the absence of a political solution between Israel and the Palestinians, a 'pivotal' body that provided 'life-saving humanitarian aid and essential social services, particularly in health and education, to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank.' In identifying eight areas for immediate improvement on the subject of neutrality (for instance, engaging donors, neutrality of staff, installations, education and staff unions), it was noted that 'Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence' that the agency’s employees had been 'members of terrorist organizations.' On October 24, UNRWA confirmed that one of its staffers killed by an Israeli strike in Gaza, Muhammad Abu Attawi, had been in the agency’s employ since July 2022 while serving as a Nukhba commander in Hamas’s Bureij Battalion. Attawi is alleged to have participated in the killing and kidnapping of Israelis from a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im in October last year. His name had featured in a July letter from Israel to the agency listing 100 names allegedly connected with terrorist groups. But no action was taken against Attawi as the Israelis failed to supply UNRWA with evidence. Lazzarini’s letter urging, in the words of Juliette Touma, the agency’s director of communications, 'to cooperate … by providing more information so he could take action' did not receive 'any response'. Having been foiled on various fronts in its quest to terminate UNRWA’s viable existence, Israeli lawmakers are now taking the legislative route to entrench the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. Two bills are in train in the Knesset. The first, sponsored by such figures as Yisrael Beytenu MK Yulia Malinovsky and Likud lawmaker Dan Illouz, would bar state authorities from having contact with UNRWA. The second, sponsored by Likud MK Boaz Bismuth, would critically prevent the agency from operating in Israeli territory through revoking a 1967 exchange of notes justifying such activities. Even proclaimed moderates – the term is relative – such as former defence minister Benny Gantz support the measures, accusing the UN body of making 'itself an inseparable component of Hamas’s mechanism – and now is the time to detach ourselves entirely from it'. It did not improve the lot of refugees, but merely perpetuated 'their victimisation.' Evidently for Gantz, Israel had no central role in creating Palestinian victims in the first place. By barring cooperation between any Israeli authorities and UNRWA, work in Gaza and the West Bank would become effectively impossible, largely because Jerusalem would no longer issue entrance permits to the territories or permit any coordination with the Israeli Defense Forces. UN Secretary-General Guterres was aghast at the two bills. 'It would effectively end coordination to protect UN convoys, offices and shelters serving hundreds of thousands of people.' Ambassadors from 123 UN member states have echoed the same views, while the Biden administration has, impotently, warned that the proposed 'restrictions would devastate the humanitarian response in Gaza at this critical moment' while also denying educational and social services to Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem. In their October 23 statement, the Nordic countries also expressed concern that UNRWA’s mandate 'to carry out […] direct relief and works programmes' for millions of Palestinian refugees as determined by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV) would be jettisoned. 'In the midst of an ongoing catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, a halt to any of the organisation’s activities would have devastating consequences for the hundreds of thousands of civilians served by UNRWA.' The statement goes on to make a warning. To impair the refugee agency would create a vacuum that 'may well destabilise the situation in [Gaza, and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem], in Israel and in the region as a whole, and may fundamentally jeopardize the prospects of a two-state solution.' These are concerns that hardly matter before the rationale of murderous collective punishment, one used against a people seen more as mute serfs and submissive animals than sovereign beings entitled to rights and protections. Israel’s efforts to malign and cripple UNRWA remains a vital part of that agenda. In that organisation exists a repository of deep and troubling memories the forces of oppression long to erase.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-wmV6dTO2IcY	2024-10-26T16:38:28-07:00	
The Synod On Synodality’s Final Document: What You Need To Know –...	By Almudena Martínez-Bordiú In a significant departure from previous synods, Pope Francis adopted the final document of the Synod on Synodality on Saturday, foregoing the traditional apostolic exhortation in favor of direct implementation of the assembly's conclusions. The 52-page document, approved by 355 synod members in attendance, outlines substantial proposals for Church renewal. The proposals include expanded women's leadership roles, greater lay participation in decision-making, and significant structural reforms. Key Developments The document emerges from a two-year consultative process that began in 2021, incorporating 1,135 amendments from both collective and individual submissions. Compared to its 2023 predecessor, the text presents more concrete recommendations and clearer structural guidelines. The final document is organized into five main sections and calls for five forms of conversion: spiritual, relational, procedural, institutional, and missionary. Structural Reforms Among the most significant proposals is a call for strengthening pastoral councils at parish and diocesan levels. The document advocates for regular ecclesiastical assemblies across all Church levels — including continental —and heightened ecumenical dialogue. The text introduces the concept of synodal authority while acknowledging that in 'a synodal Church, the authority of the Bishop, of the Episcopal College and of the Bishop of Rome in regard to decision-taking is inviolable.' 'Such an exercise of authority, however, is not without limits,' the document adds. On this view, the text calls for a revision in canon law, 'clarifying the distinction and relation between consultation and deliberation and shedding light on the responsibilities of those who play different roles in the decision-making process.' Women's Leadership In a notable development, the document explicitly states there is 'no reason or impediment' to prevent women from assuming leadership roles in the Church. Furthermore, 'the question of women's access to diaconal ministry remains open,' and that discernment should continue. The text advocates for increased female participation in clergy formation and broader involvement in Church decision-making processes. Lay Participation The document significantly expands the role of lay faithful in Church governance. It calls for their increased presence in synodal assemblies and all phases of ecclesiastical decision-making. New procedures for selecting and evaluating bishops and expanded lay participation in diocesan leadership and canonical processes are proposed. Implementation Phase While Pope Francis has declared the synodal path 'completed,' the document emphasizes that a crucial implementation phase lies ahead. This next stage will focus on integrating synodality as a 'constitutive dimension of the Church.' The text also addresses accountability measures, calling for enhanced financial transparency and protocols for abuse prevention, declaring: 'The need within the Church for healing, reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust has resounded at every stage of the synodal process.' Background The document represents the culmination of one of the most extensive consultative processes in Church history, building on both the 2023 assembly's work and the broader synodal journey initiated by Pope Francis in 2021. The exercise aimed to balance traditional Church teaching with contemporary pastoral needs while promoting greater inclusivity and transparency in Church governance.

Geopolitical Expansion In BRICS Summit 2024: A Strategic Strength...	The recent expansion of BRICS presents considerable geopolitical ramifications, particularly for Russia, which has leveraged its membership to mitigate the economic and political isolation enforced by the United States and NATO since the commencement of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The strategy employed by Russia to utilize BRICS as a countervailing bloc has garnered significant momentum, particularly in light of Western sanctions that have compelled Moscow to pursue financial systems and trade routes that operate independently of the U.S. dollar. In the course of this expansion, Russia secures not only economic allies but also geopolitical partners who possess a shared interest in contesting the prevailing Western-dominated global order. The BRICS encompasses roughly 30% of the global landmass and constitutes 45% of the world's population. South Africa is recognized as the foremost economy within the African continent, whereas Brazil, India, and China are positioned among the top ten nations worldwide concerning population, land area, nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and purchasing power parity. The five founding member states collectively possess a nominal GDP of US$28 trillion, representing approximately 27% of the global gross product. Their aggregate GDP, calculated on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), is approximately reached to the amount of US$ 65 trillion, which constitutes 33% of the global GDP PPP. BRICS Summit 2024’s Agenda On the 23 and 24 October, Russia convened the 16th Summit of the BRICS. Representatives from 32 nations had participated in this Summit in Kazan, Russia. The summit has arisen as the preeminent geopolitical event orchestrated by Russia in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, symbolizing the Kremlin's strategic pursuit to promote a multipolar world order as a counterweight to U.S. dominance. The BRICS Summit revolved around the agenda of 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Fair Global Development and Security,' underscoring the organization's commitment to promoting a multipolar world order that emphasizes inclusivity and the reform of global governance frameworks. In accordance with this strategic initiative, the BRICS has introduced 'BRICS Pay,' a payment system aimed at improving transaction efficiency and facilitating information exchange among the central banks within the bloc. This initiative functions as a credible alternative to the SWIFT system, thus facilitating international settlements that operate autonomously from the existing Western financial architecture. In the quest for multilateral aims, the BRICS has adopted the 'BRICS Kazan Declaration,' which championed the reforms within the United Nations, especially regarding the Security Council, and endorses the full participation of Palestine in the United Nations as part of a two-state solution. Moreover, the BRICS nations have come to an agreement to explore the creation of a cross-border settlement and depository system, entrusting finance ministers with the task of continuously assessing the feasibility of national currencies in the context of international payments.On October 24, a session convened by Russia in the BRICS Plus/Outreach format brought together representatives from the CIS, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, indicating a notable expansion of BRICS' global influence. Thirteen new partner countries—Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam—have recently aligned themselves with the broadened agenda of BRICS, highlighting the organization's growing influence across diverse geopolitical contexts. The agenda of multipolarity and multilateralism, promoting the pursuit of a more equitable global order have been figured in the Kazan Declaration. The declaration offers a nuanced critique of Western practices by articulating the deep apprehension about the adverse effects of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions, on the global economy, international trade, and the advancement of sustainable development objectives. Russia -Ukraine War and Sanction Regime Commencing in February 2022, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has raised geopolitical concerns and resulted in broad US, European Union’s sanctions. Sanctions on Russia's financial sector, energy exports, and technological access constitute crucial first steps towards isolating her diplomatically and economically. Russia's financial power was contracted as more than $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves were frozen and major Russian banks were expelled out of SWIFT, so limiting international transactions. An EU embargo on Russian coal, gas, and oil as well as a G7-imposed price cap on Russian crude have further taxed Russia's income from energy exports. The ruble declined, inflation increased, and Russia's GDP were contracted by 2-3% in 2022 as a result of the economic interruptions caused by these sanctions. Russian companies are experiencing challenges in filling the gaps in the consumer and technology markets as a result of the widespread withdrawal of Western corporations from Russia. Additionally, Russia's economic and military advancements are restricted by export restrictions on advanced technologies, including semiconductors. In spite of these challenges, Russia has responded by increasing trade with countries outside the Western bloc, particularly China and India, and the economic consequences have been less severe than initially anticipated. The sanctions have fortified Russia's alliances with China and other BRICS countries and have facilitated its geopolitical transition toward Asia by altering trade and energy flows. Europe's energy costs experienced a significant increase as a result of its diversification of energy sources to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. This involved the imports of more LNG from the United States and other suppliers. Russia has responded by redirecting its cheap gas and oil exports to Asian markets, thereby diminishing Europe's influence in the global energy market and forging new trade relationships. Furthermore, the sanctions and war have revealed the vulnerabilities of the Western-led order. The SWIFT enforcement of sanctions has placed significant pressure on European economies, particularly due to inflation and the increasing cost of energy. This has prompted certain international powers, including allies of the United States, to investigate alternatives to the dollar-based financial system and has drawn attention to the dollar's deficiencies as a primary tool for sanctions. The sanctions have driven Moscow to pivot towards the East, forge alliances with Asian partners, and contribute to the establishment of a multipolar global order that diminishes dependence on U.S.-controlled financial systems. The Geopolitical Expansion of BRICS The geopolitical expansion of BRICS, highlighted at the 2024 Kazan Summit, marks a pivotal shift in global politics, notably influencing Russia's strategic manoeuvres within the sphere of international relations. The inclusion of countries such as Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE reflects a strategic initiative to enhance the representation of the Global South and emerging markets within BRICS. This membership expansion aims to strategically reshape global power dynamics, challenging the dominance of Western-centric institutions and bolstering the collective negotiating power of the bloc. The summit highlighted the proposal for a BRICS common currency, designed to boost trade among the member nations. This initiative holds considerable significance for Russia and its allies, as it reduces reliance on the U.S. dollar, challenging Western economic supremacy and fostering greater financial stability in the region. The summit highlighted the critical role of collaboration in political and security issues, emphasizing the need to combat terrorism and address regional conflicts. The BRICS nations have committed to mutual support in these areas, advocating for a multipolar world order that respects national sovereignty and rejects interference in domestic affairs. The expansion of BRICS presents Russia with a crucial opportunity to regain its standing in global politics by strengthening ties with the new member countries. This strategic move allows Russia to alleviate the impact of Western sanctions and political isolation while promoting a multipolar world order that challenges Western dominance. Furthermore, increased economic collaboration within BRICS allows Russia to expand its trade partnerships, reducing dependence on traditional Western markets while exploring new trade routes and investment opportunities. Moreover, Russia's involvement in BRICS fosters alignment with countries that share common geopolitical and geostrategic interests, nurturing collaborative security frameworks that enhance regional stability and forge strategic alliances on global platforms. Therefore, the geopolitical expansion of BRICS marks a significant shift in global power dynamics, allowing Russia to enhance its influence, broaden economic ties, and strengthen security alliances with emerging economies, thereby reshaping international relations. Kazan Declaration: Russia Strategic Gains The Kazan Declaration offers a thorough framework aimed at enhancing multilateralism and fostering a more just and democratic global order. Essential elements encompass the emergence of new power centers, dedication to multilateralism, the need for reform in global governance, advocacy for UN reform, and a focus on establishing a fair and inclusive multilateral trading system. The document highlights the significance of a multipolar world that enables emerging and developing countries (EMDCs) to engage more actively in global affairs. The Declaration advocates for a cooperative strategy in global governance, highlighting the United Nations as a fundamental pillar for peace, security, human rights, democracy, and development. BRICS advocates for a thorough reform of the UN, with a specific focus on the Security Council, aiming to improve both representation and effectiveness. The Declaration underscores the necessity for a strong Global Financial Safety Net, advocating for reforms in Bretton Woods institutions such as the IMF to more accurately represent the contributions of EMDCs to the global economy. A central pillar of Russia’s BRICS strategy is the creation of alternative financial channels. With Western sanctions effectively severing Russia’s access to SWIFT and limiting its dollar transactions, the Kremlin has been vocal about BRICS’ potential for developing a parallel financial infrastructure. In the Summit, Russia proposed a 'BRICS Bridge,' a blockchain-based payment system aimed at reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. Although this proposal has yet to be fully realized, it signals Moscow’s commitment to a multipolar financial system that could eventually bypass Western financial controls. This economic weight of BRICS provides Russia with crucial markets and resources, bolstering its trade relations in sectors like energy, technology, and agriculture. In response to sanctions, Russia has pivoted toward energy trade with China and India, two of BRICS’ largest members, with Russian oil exports to China increasing by 55% in 2023 alone has weakened the efficacy of sanctions, underscoring the limitations of Western financial isolation when alternative networks exist. The 16th BRICS Summit in 2024 marked a pivotal change in the landscape of challenging U.S. dominance in political, economic, and geopolitical arenas. The summit underscored the necessity of creating a multipolar world order as a response to the U.S.-dominated unipolarity that has existed since the conclusion of the Cold War. The BRICS member states have pledged to work together on crucial matters including international governance, human rights, and the rule of law. This partnership seeks to establish a cohesive opposition to the Western standards that have long influenced global conversations. The inclusion of countries like Argentina, Egypt, and Iran in BRICS exemplifies this political challenge clearly for the western dominance. The unification of developing countries under the BRICS framework effectively reduces the political influence of the United States and its allies, facilitating a synchronized strategy toward common interests and political objectives. This strategic partnership empowers BRICS to amplify its impact in global discussions. The summit highlighted initiatives aimed at creating alternative financial systems that contest the existing economic supremacy of the United States. The primary emphasis was on the proposal for a unified BRICS currency designed to enhance trade and diminish dependence on the U.S. dollar, a crucial element of American economic dominance. Moreover, the BRICS nations are actively working on the creation of bilateral trade agreements that circumvent the dollar, thereby strengthening economic resilience among the member states. The summit underscored the significance of joint security initiatives to tackle common challenges, especially in areas like Eastern Europe and the Middle East. BRICS seeks to shape global governance by promoting reforms in international institutions, particularly the United Nations, to enhance the representation of emerging economies' interests. The expansion of BRICS signals a cautionary note to the U.S. and NATO, highlighting that nations are progressively exploring alternatives beyond Western-dominated organizations. More than 40 countries have shown interest in joining BRICS, highlighting a significant demand for a global framework that facilitates more equitable involvement. This trend poses a risk of diminishing Western influence and suggests that unilateral sanctions may prove ineffective in the presence of alternative alliances. Internal Challenges Despite the potential for geopolitical impact, the expansion also brings internal challenges, notably in managing diverse member interests. BRICS’ decision-making process is consensus-based, meaning differing agendas could create friction, particularly between China and India, both of whom have contrasting approaches to global governance. China’s role in BRICS is often viewed as dominant, which may create hesitations among other members wary of excessive Chinese influence. Russia’s role, therefore, may be one of balancing relationships and mediating between competing national interests to maintain cohesion within BRICS. While countries like Brazil and South Africa favor a more diplomatic stance that does not directly oppose Western structures, Russia and China are keen on positioning BRICS as a competitor to the Western-dominated international order. As a result, maintaining internal unity within the expanded BRICS could be a challenge, particularly as each member has unique relationships with the U.S. and the West. Conclusion In summary, the geopolitical expansion of BRICS signifies a crucial geopolitical strategy for Russia, enabling it to mitigate Western sanctions and reinforce its presence on the international arena. Through the promotion of a multipolar world order and the creation of alternative economic frameworks, Russia been anticipating to effectively counter the impacts of U.S. isolation strategies. The recent BRICS Summit in Kazan underscored the bloc's dedication to transforming global governance and fostering collaboration among emerging economies, thus contesting the power of Western institutions. Nonetheless, this expansion brings forth internal challenges, as the varied interests of members may hinder the process of reaching a consensus within the group. The increasing influence of BRICS compels Western powers to reassess their engagement strategies with the Global South, reflecting a shift in the dynamics of international relations towards a more multipolar landscape. Ultimately, the advancements within BRICS not only enhance Russia's geopolitical position but also signify a wider shift in global power dynamics, where the quest for multipolarity is steadily materializing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-4W4WFYz0z9d	2024-10-26T16:36:00-07:00	
Climate Meet COP 29: Sign Of Hope Or Despair? – OpEd	The forthcoming Climate Meet COP 29 that would take place from November 9 to November 22 at Azerbaijan does not seem to have created any euphoria. On the other hand, there is considerable skepticism about the outcome of the COP 29, considering the outcome of the earlier 28 climate meets in different countries. Has anything changed? The ground reality is that nothing much has changed over the years and global warming continue to take place, causing severe and unexpected weather changes and several other adverse impacts on climate One cannot but get an impression that the climate meets have become sort of annual ritual, marked by loud claims, high level of promise and particularly with focus by developing countries demanding fund support from developed countries to implement eco-friendly measures to protect global climate. It is well recognized that to protect the global climate, emission of noxious gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide, methane gas have to be curbed and ultimately eliminated to get zero emission. The first requisite to achieve such drastic reduction in the emission of noxious gases is that the consumption of fossil fuel such as coal, crude oil have to be slashed down and ultimately stopped. This is not happening. Ambitious targets going for a toss Several countries have fixed target for themselves to achieve zero emission in time bound schedule, with India promising that it would achieve zero emission by the year 2070 while China fixed the deadline of year 2050 and various other schedule by different countries. While such ambitious targets have been fixed to achieve zero emission, the ground reality is that these promises have not been followed by reduction in the production and use level of coal, crude oil, natural gas and reduction in the emission of methane gas from livestock. Neither the producers of fossil fuel are reducing production nor the consumers of fossil fuel are reducing consumption over the years. On the other hand, consumption of fossil fuel like coal have been steadily increasing, in spite of the promises made during climate meets by different countries. In such circumstances, one gets an impression that all tall promises to reduce emission have been made in vacuum. Can use of fossil fuel be entirely eliminated? It is now well recognized that the substitute for fossil fuel for energy generation are alternate eco-friendly energy source such as renewable energy from solar, wind and hydro, increasing production of green hydrogen, increasing the production of biofuel etc. But, the development and production of the alternate eco-friendly energy source are slow and nowhere near the level required for matching the need. It is mainly due to several issues with regard to alternate energy source such as high production cost of green hydrogen produced from water source and limitations in wind, solar and hydro power due to seasonal factors and uneconomic capacity utilization as well as curtailment of methane gas emission not happening as livestock population cannot be reduced. While alternate energy source is much needed and should be developed with utmost efforts, still alternate energy source cannot significantly reduce the demand for fossil fuel, particularly since the energy demand and consequent demand for fossil fuel are steadily increasing. Why not reduce energy demand? One solution on which the climate meets are not focusing is with regard to the possibility of steady reduction in the energy demand, so that the demand for fossil fuel can be brought down. Of course, developing countries would particularly object to the reduction of energy demand, as it would adversely impact the industrial and economic growth of the countries. Alternately, the demand for energy can be brought down by optimization of energy utilization by technological advancements and development of non energy intensive products and services. However, this can be done only to a limited extent with no significant impact on the overall demand for fossil fuel. Target population to reduce energy demand Possibly, another way of reducing energy demand is to reduce the global population level. While a few countries such as South Korea, Japan, Russia are concerned about the population level reducing and are taking steps to increase the population by offering special incentives to people, there are countries like India and in Africa where the populations are steadily increasing. The net result is that the global population is now steadily increasing. Since more population means more energy demand and more fossil fuel consumption, the COP 29 climate meet should discuss this issue and fix target for level of global population to be reached and to be stabilised at that level. Impact of wars and conflicts Even as all countries are concerned about climate issues and almost all of them are participating in the global climate meets, some of the participating countries are indulging in bloody conflicts and wars such as the ongoing Russia Ukraine war and the ongoing Israel Hamas war. Further, terrorist activities are also taking place frequently in different locations. All such wars and terrorist activities involve use of missiles, dropping of bombs, shootings, drone attack and so on which cause emission of huge quantity of toxic gases and cause severe atmospheric pollution. It appears that climate meets have not discussed these aspects at all. COP 29 sign of hope or despair The question is whether the forthcoming COP 29 will be more forthright in discussing the issues in depth and calling a spade a spade, instead of confining itself to cosmetic discussions. Based on the proceedings of the past meets, there is certainly justification to view the forthcoming COP 29 climate meet as sign of despair.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-4U0VkLp0ZGj	2024-10-26T16:28:39-07:00	
How Indonesian Migrant Workers In ASEAN Region Coped With Pandemi...	The role of migrant workers in the ASEAN region is crucial to the economies of the region. The mobility of labour enables workers to move around countries in southeast Asia to work in various sectors such as construction, plantation, manufacturing, domestic work and services. Within the ASEAN region, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam are the major 'supplier' of foreign labor, whereas, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are the major 'receiving' countries where the migrant workers go to work. Malaysia sees the largest number of migrant flows in the region. Migrant workers fill critical labour shortages in nations where there are not enough domestic workers. On the one hand, businesses gain as they are in a position to produce more goods, thereby boosting their productivity. On the other hand, the remittances sent by migrant workers back home support their families and also stimulating the economies of home countries. However, despite their economic contributions migrant workers face several public health challenges which often put their health and even lives at risk. Workers face occupational hazards due to dangerous nature of their work. These include the risk of injury, exposure to toxins and not to mention the long working hours that could be physically demanding. At times, there are as many as 8 to 12 persons housed in a single room or dorm. These overcrowded and often unsanitary housing contributes to the spread of infectious diseases. Financial constraints and the pressure to send money back home further exacerbates the situation as it prevents them to seek proper medical disgnosis and treatment. Isolation, discrimination, sometimes undocumented status, impacts the mental health of these migrant workers. ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers is a document adopted by ASEAN member countries in 2007 that outlines the responsibilities of both receiving and sending states in ensuring the protection of fundamental human rights of migrant workers. The document also acknowledged the right of each member state’s right as a sovereign state to determine its migration policies. While of the obligation of the receiving states is to ensure the provision of fair employment conditions and access to legal systems, the sending states had an obligation to offer alternative employment opportunities, worker protection, and reintegration upon returning home. The declaration also expects all the ASEAN nations to achieve decent work conditions for migrants, prevent human trafficking, capacity building, training programs, and assistance to migrant workers in crisis circumstances. It has been 17 years since this declaration was signed. Migrant workers are vital to the economies of many ASEAN member countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore. These workers work in other regions or nations to fend for themselves and their families back home. The Indonesian migrant workers, in particular, significantly represent the labor force of these countries. However, despite their contributions, they face numerous challenges, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 'infodemic—a flood of misinformation.' Here I examine the condition of such Indonesian migrant workers in ASEAN, focusing on their coping strategies during COVID-19 and highlighting their struggles and resilience. While Malaysia is one of the preferred countries for Indonesians seeking employment, cases will also be drawn from other ASEAN countries to give a more extensive view of the regional issues. The labor challenges—limited access to healthcare, wage exploitation, and poor living standards have always been the major problems for Indonesian migrant workers in ASEAN countries. These issues are well observed in countries such as Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia where they work in domestic services, construction and agriculture. Past studies have pointed to working conditions among Indonesian workers in the Thai fishing industry which include low safety levels. Furthermore, domestic workers who have been the pillars of Indonesian households back home had been subject to wage thefts and long working hours as mobility was restricted. (International Labor Organization, 2020). Indonesian workers in the region were also the hardest hit by the pandemic as many of them either lost their jobs or had to face wage cuts. Research conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in 2024 revealed that a greater number of these workers could not return to Indonesia because of the closure of borders, and were living in their host countries, vulnerable and neglected (International Organization for Migration, 2024). Most of these migrant workers lived in overcrowded dormitories with a higher risk of spreading COVID 19. For instance, in Singapore, such accommodation facilities were found to be among the main sources of COVID-19 in 2020. Nonetheless, Indonesian migrant workers stayed resilient in various ways during these challenging situations. The ASEAN community networks have acted as a bridge, especially in the time of the pandemic. For instance, Indonesian workers in Thailand were dependent on the informal social support structures which allowed to them to share resources and verified information. It was also a source of emotional backing during these difficult times. The domestic workers in Singapore utilized digital platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook to stay connected by sharing experiences and important information regarding safety and health​ measures (International Organization for Migration, 2024) Another important development during the pandemic was combating misinformation using digital platforms. During COVID-19, the 'infodemic' resulted in widespread disinformation related to vaccines, safety measures, and government policies. Limited access to accurate information in the native language, also made Indonesian migrant workers easy prey for such falsehoods. Virtual ethnography—a methodology focused on online communities has shown that migrant workers turned to online platforms to confirm such information and talk about their rights. For instance, Indonesian workers in Malaysia resorted to using digital media to demystify rumors surrounding COVID-19 vaccines and pass relevant health information (Human Rights Watch, 2023; International Labor Organization, 2020). Furthermore, financial coping strategies have also evolved during this time. Most Indonesian migrant workers, especially domestic ones and construction workers had to work multiple jobs to fill in the income gap. In Thailand for example, Indonesian workers employed in the fishing industry despite health risks still worked in stringent conditions to feed their families back home (Globalization and Health, 2021). These efforts were complemented by remittance systems which continued to function during the pandemic but with less amount in people’s pockets because of wage deductions. Indonesian migrant workers irrespective of ASEAN nation they were working in, experienced similar problems; some countries however implemented suitable policies. For instance, Thailand enacted emergency labor laws aiming to safeguard the rights of migrant workers especially in sectors like; farming, and fishing, among others. Still, its implementation was not standardized; many workers claimed that the protection of labor rights was poor​ (International Labor Organization, 2020). On one hand, construction and plantation Indonesian workers in Malaysia have been vulnerable at the time of the pandemic. Although regional development frameworks such as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Indonesia and Malaysia aimed at enhancing protections for these workers was enacted at the height of pandemic in 2022, its implementation had been, however, slow, hence depriving the workers the adequate protection (International Organization for Migration, 2024). On the other hand, Singapore imposed and enhanced healthcare policies in worker dormitories and provided access to healthcare to migrants during the pandemic. However, as highlighted by the Globalization and Health Journal (2021), several Indonesian workers expressed reluctance in seeking medical care to avoid being deported as several of these workers were either undocumented or lacked proper work permits. ​ Interestingly, during the pandemic social media and other technologies have played a vital part in building support for lonely and vulnerable Indonesian migrant workers. Virtual ethnography, as mentioned earlier, studies online interactions, indicated that migrant workers relied on Social Media more to communicate and seek support. Specifically, while WhatsApp became important in the sharing of factual news, Facebook groups allowed migrants to remain close to their loved ones in Indonesia​ (International Organization for Migration, 2024). Nations like Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia have taken measures to provide adequate protection to migrant workers during the pandemic, but much is needed to be done to safeguard their health as well. The bilateral agreements been Indonesia and Malaysia did hold good promise but there was a need for stronger enforcement so that the labor rights and health of these workers could be better safeguarded. Regarding the measures for enhancing the resilience of migrant labor systems, the following actions could be considered: enhancing the legal protection of the migrants, increasing access to credible information and improving the digital competencies of prospective migrant workers.

Russian-Ukraine War And Middle East Crisis: Global Impacts Of Oil...	The ongoing crises in Ukraine and the Middle East are reshaping global energy and trade landscapes. Russia and Ukraine occupy strategic positions in global energy exports and agricultural production, while the Middle East serves as a focal point for oil flows and geopolitical stability. October 2024 marked heightened military engagements, the intensification of sanctions, and consequential economic ripples that impacted both oil supplies and the global economy. This essay argues that the overlapping effects of the Russia-Ukraine war and Middle Eastern conflicts are intensifying economic vulnerabilities worldwide. Addressing these challenges necessitates coordinated international efforts and forward-looking policy frameworks to stabilize critical sectors. Background and Contextual Analysis Russian-Ukraine War: Key Developments and Economic Repercussions The escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war since 2022 has created significant strains on energy supplies. A timeline of key escalations reveals an intensification of sanctions, particularly against Russian oil and gas exports, which have substantially disrupted supply chains. As Europe has sought to decrease its reliance on Russian energy sources, alternative supply networks have been explored, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. However, these adjustments have proven challenging due to limited infrastructure and increased competition for energy resources. Europe's new alliances with the Middle East have also driven up demand for Gulf oil; yet, the infrastructure in these regions struggles to keep pace with the growing reliance. Middle East Crisis: Overview and Strategic Importance Recent hostilities between Israel and Gaza have escalated into a regional crisis that threatens the stability of the Strait of Hormuz—a critical chokepoint through which nearly a third of the world’s oil supply transits. The security of this region affects energy supply continuity and pricing on a global scale. Oil-dependent nations, particularly in Asia and Europe, are especially vulnerable to supply disruptions stemming from these geopolitical tensions. The crises reveal broader implications for oil-dependent economies, with energy security concerns amplified by the strategic and logistical fragility of the oil infrastructure in this region. The Global Oil Market Shock Price Volatility and Economic Pressures Oil prices have experienced significant fluctuations since the onset of recent crises, reaching unprecedented levels in October 2024. Import-dependent nations, particularly those within developing economies, confront increased fuel costs that exacerbate inflationary pressures and diminish purchasing power for other essential imports. These resultant economic strains extend to sectors reliant on energy-intensive processes, including transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. Numerous governments, notably those of the United States, European Union, and China, have tapped into strategic reserves to stabilize markets; however, these measures constitute short-term remedies, underscoring the necessity for sustainable and reliable energy policies to safeguard against similar shocks in the future. Diversifying Oil Supplies and Strategic Reserves In light of ongoing price volatility, both the European Union and Asia-Pacific economies are intensifying investments in renewable energy sources, encompassing wind, solar, nuclear, and green hydrogen. The EU's pivot towards the Gulf States and Africa for oil and gas supplies marks a significant alteration in geopolitical alliances. Long-term strategies focus on diversifying energy supplies and fostering regional energy independence through technological innovations and robust investments in renewable energy infrastructure. Attaining true resilience will necessitate cross-sector and cross-national collaboration, as well as significant financial resources to ensure that these energy solutions align with the scale of global demand. Trade and Supply Chain Disruptions Key Trade Route Blockades and Instabilities Trade routes adjacent to conflict zones—particularly the Black Sea and the Strait of Hormuz—are beset by security threats. Naval skirmishes and the militarization of these regions disrupt the flow of essential goods, including oil and grain. The obstruction of Ukrainian grain exports, coupled with threats to oil shipments from the Middle East, has escalated shipping costs and inflated prices across various commodities. Furthermore, insurance premiums for cargo traversing conflict zones have also surged, further heightening operational expenses for both importers and exporters. Ensuring the security of trade routes remains a critical issue, necessitating coordinated responses to effectively mitigate these disruptions. Diversification and Regionalization of Trade Routes In response to these challenges, nations are increasingly investing in alternative trade routes that circumvent conflict zones. EU-Africa trade routes and Indo-Pacific trade corridor initiatives represent essential frameworks for developing reliable supply chain infrastructures. Major projects, including the expansion of ports, railways, and pipelines, are currently underway to minimize dependence on perilous routes. Nevertheless, these initiatives are associated with substantial costs and confront significant implementation challenges, requiring extended timelines to reach full operational capacity. Efforts to regionalize trade and enhance logistical resilience are vital for reducing vulnerability to high-risk areas. Economic Growth and Global Inflation Concerns Deterioration in Global Growth Projections The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have revised downward their growth projections for the years 2024 and 2025, citing ongoing conflicts in energy-producing regions as a primary factor for these declines. The energy, manufacturing, and food production sectors are experiencing the most significant impacts. Emerging markets, in particular, are grappling with the dual pressures of rising energy and food import costs, alongside an increased necessity for currency devaluation, which exacerbates their debt profiles. This economic slowdown not only affects developing economies but also disrupts interconnected global supply chains that are susceptible to disturbances stemming from regional conflicts. Rising Global Inflation Global inflation continues to escalate due to increased costs in fuel, food, and transportation. Central banks face a challenging policy dilemma: raising interest rates to curb inflation may hinder economic growth, whereas the absence of action could allow inflation to spiral uncontrollably. This situation poses particular challenges for emerging economies, which are already struggling with high inflation rates and economic instability. Effectively addressing inflation through a combination of monetary policy measures and targeted relief programs is essential to protect these economies from sustained economic distress. Policy and Strategic Recommendations Energy Independence and Sustainability Initiatives Diversification of energy sources through the adoption of renewables remains of paramount importance. Governments are prioritizing investments in wind, solar, nuclear, and hydrogen technologies. National policies should incentivize rapid transitions towards energy independence, especially in nations that are particularly susceptible to oil price volatility. Moreover, the establishment of expanded energy-sharing agreements could facilitate the allocation of resources during supply crises. Sustainable energy models can significantly reduce dependency on oil markets, thereby helping to mitigate economic vulnerabilities associated with fluctuating oil supplies. Multilateral Cooperation and Crisis Management International organizations such as the United Nations (UN), International Energy Agency (IEA), and World Trade Organization (WTO) play crucial roles in the coordination of multilateral crisis management efforts. Developing frameworks for sharing emergency oil reserves, accessible to smaller economies, can contribute to enhanced stability. Historical crises, exemplified by agreements among OPEC+, illustrate the efficacy of coordinated actions in stabilizing markets, highlighting the importance of collaborative solutions. Such cooperation is especially pertinent in safeguarding supply chains in regions where the risks of disruption are elevated. Strategic Trade Route Protection and Alternatives Countries can enhance the resilience of trade routes by pursuing regional trade agreements, such as those between the Indo-Pacific and Africa-EU regions, which provide alternative transportation options and strengthen supply chains. Furthermore, increased investment in secure transport infrastructure, including anti-piracy measures and maritime security initiatives, is essential to ensure the safe passage of goods in volatile areas. Economic Relief and Debt Relief for Vulnerable Economies The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank should spearhead initiatives to implement debt relief and provide financial assistance to economies struggling with elevated import costs and inflation. Conditional debt moratoriums serve as essential mechanisms for countries experiencing economic instability, allowing them to prioritize crucial imports and stabilize domestic markets without further compromising growth. Conclusion In conclusion, the interrelated crises in Europe and the Middle East are redefining global energy dynamics, trade patterns, and economic priorities. A coordinated international response is imperative to address these disruptions, stabilize oil markets, safeguard trade and energy security, and promote independence. The pressing necessity for resilient infrastructure and diversified energy sources is paramount, as nations navigate these intricate geopolitical realities to achieve sustained growth and stability.

Robert Reich: Cowardice And Intimidation At The Washington Post A...	Will Lewis, the chief executive of the Washington Post, announced that the paper would not endorse a presidential candidate this year. Why not? Lewis explained that the paper was 'returning to its roots' when it didn’t endorse presidential candidates. Lewis’s explanation raises more questions than it answers. ThePosthas made an endorsement for president in every election since 1976, when it supported the candidacy of Jimmy Carter. Before the late 1970s, thePostdid not usually make presidential endorsements, although it made an exception in 1952 to back Dwight D. Eisenhower. Yet it wasn’t until the 1970s — with its exposure of Richard Nixon’s illegal break-ins at the Watergate complex and subsequent cover-ups — that theWashington Postbecame a respected national newspaper with a reputation for holding the powerful accountable. Why decide not endorsenow,when America faces an election with potentially enormous consequences for democracy at home and abroad — with someone on the presidential ballot arguably far worse than Nixon? Besides, the paper had endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016, and Joe Biden over Trump in 2020. What’s changed now? The only credible explanation I can think of is that thePost’sbillionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, doesn’t want to raise the ire of Donald Trump, should Trump become president — especially now that Trump has declared his intention to punish his opponents. Bezos’s other businesses have many federal government contracts, and his largest — Amazon — is the current target of a federal antitrust suit. Assuming this is the explanation, it stinks. It undermines the credibility of one of our leading newspapers. It preventsThe Washington Postfrom exercising its responsibility to tell the public where it stands on Trump and why. The New York Times’seditorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom,endorsedHarris for president on Sept. 30, saying: 'It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump.' At least one member of theWashington Post’sopinions department, Robert Kagan, has resigned. The rest of the opinions department should do so as well. Immediately. We are come to a juncture in America where, as in the first Gilded Age, enormous wealth is lodged in a very few hands — hands that are now either actively supporting Trump (such as Elon Musk) or afraid to come out against him for fear he’ll wreak vengeance on them if they do. Trump has already seriously endangered American democracy. Those who are afraid to stand up to his bullying are only encouraging him to further assail democracy. Marty Baron, the recent editor ofThe Postcalledthe decision 'cowardice, with democracy as its casualty. Baron predicted that Trump would view it as an invitation to continue to try to intimidate Bezos and others. ThePost’smove follows the decision by the billionaire owner ofThe Los Angeles Times,Patrick Soon-Shiong, to block a planned presidential endorsement at that newspaper as well —resulting in the resignation of the head of the editorial board and two of its writers. Mariel Garza, who resigned as editorials editor, said in aninterviewwith the Columbia Journalism Review that the editorial board had planned to endorse Kamala Harris, but that Dr. Soon-Shiong informed the editorial board on Oct. 11 thatThe Timeswould not be publishing any presidential endorsement. 'I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,' Ms. Garza said. 'In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up.' Exactly. And in dangerous times, dishonest and cowardly billionaires shouldn’t be able to abuse their power by preventing honest people from standing up. This is how fascism takes root.

Assessing Causes Of Terrorism In Afghanistan – OpEd	In a recent statement on X, Afghan government spokesperson Qahar Balkhi expressed serious concern about the escalating political tensions in Pakistan, warning that the situation could have negative repercussions for the entire region. While the sentiment of concern for regional stability is commendable, the delivery and context of the statement raise significant questions about its appropriateness. It is crucial to recognize that Afghanistan should prioritize addressing its internal issues rather than critiquing its neighbors’ political dynamics. Firstly, Balkhi’s comments represent not just an expression of concern but an unwarranted interference in Pakistan’s domestic affairs. This kind of rhetoric is not only frivolous but also deeply troubling, as it overlooks Afghanistan’s own pressing challenges. The Taliban regime is grappling with severe governance failures that undermine basic human rights and civil liberties. Instead of casting aspersions on Pakistan, it would be wiser for Afghan authorities to concentrate on stabilizing their own government and addressing the myriad problems plaguing Afghanistan. The ongoing suppression of basic rights in Afghanistan is a critical issue that demands attention. Since the Taliban took power in August 2021, reports have emerged detailing widespread violations of human rights, including restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. The Taliban’s stringent policies, particularly against women and girls, have led to a humanitarian crisis that the international community cannot ignore. Before the Afghan government attempts to advise Pakistan on its internal matters, it must first focus on resolving the humanitarian crises and media suppression that afflict its own population. Moreover, Afghanistan is grappling with an alarming economic decline, exacerbated by the international community’s withdrawal of support following the Taliban’s takeover. The economy, already fragile, has suffered further due to sanctions and isolation, pushing millions into poverty and hunger. The situation in Afghanistan presents a far more immediate threat to regional security than the internal political dynamics of Pakistan. The Taliban’s focus should be on addressing the economic challenges their citizens face rather than pontificating on Pakistan’s political scene. Furthermore, the issue of terrorism and extremist safe havens remains a grave concern that should occupy the minds of Afghan officials. Afghanistan has long been a breeding ground for terrorist groups, and the resurgence of such entities poses a significant risk to regional stability. If the Taliban truly care about promoting peace in the region, their efforts should be directed towards combating the rampant terrorism and extremism that plague their own country. Addressing these threats not only benefits Afghanistan but also fosters a more secure environment for its neighbors, including Pakistan. It is both ironic and impractical for Afghan officials to criticize another country’s governance while their own regime is struggling with severe internal issues. A more pragmatic approach would involve focusing on effective governance, restoring the rule of law, and ensuring the protection of basic human rights for their citizens. By doing so, Afghanistan could stabilize its internal situation, which would ultimately contribute to regional peace and security. Adding to the irony of Balkhi’s statement is the recent incident in Islamabad, where approximately 120 Afghan nationals were arrested for attacking police and disturbing public order. This reality underscores a troubling paradox: while Afghan officials are quick to critique Pakistan, their own citizens are engaged in actions that disrupt the stability of the neighboring country. Before taking on the role of an advisor, the Taliban should ensure that their own nationals are not contributing to regional instability. As the saying goes, actions speak louder than lofty statements. The Taliban’s approach to governance and regional relations requires a fundamental shift in perspective. Rather than attempting to assert influence over Pakistan’s political landscape, they should work on building a stable, functional government that prioritizes the welfare of Afghan citizens. Only by addressing their own internal issues can they hope to gain credibility and respect on the international stage. In conclusion, Afghanistan must look inwards and focus on its own governance challenges before pointing fingers at its neighbors. The Taliban's interference in Pakistan's internal matters is not only unhelpful but also hypocritical, given the numerous crises their regime is facing. By prioritizing stability, human rights, and economic recovery, Afghanistan can contribute positively to regional dynamics rather than exacerbate tensions through unfounded criticisms. Ultimately, a stable Afghanistan will lead to a more peaceful and secure region, benefitting all its neighbors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-z8NOjERTJH6	2024-10-26T16:08:58-07:00	
Georgia Pivoting Toward Russia? Difficult Days Ahead – Analysis	This Saturday, October 26, citizens of the Republic of Georgia in the South Caucasus began voting in parliamentary elections that will determine the future of their country. Georgia's political arena is divided between a pro-European opposition and a ruling party accused of pro-Russian authoritarianism. Polling stations opened at around 8 a.m. local time. The first exit polls will be conducted after they close at 8 p.m. Both the government and the opposition describe today's vote as a choice of destiny - a choice between war and peace, between the European Union and Russia. But many Georgians are more worried about their economic situation than about joining the European Union. On October 24, a politician from the opposition party Droa ('It's Time!') posted a message on X saying: 'Two days and two hours until Georgia is free! There is great hope among civil society and the liberal opposition that the parliamentary elections will bring an end to the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012. They point to the number of participants in anti-government protests. On October 20, tens of thousands took part in a demonstration calling for Georgia to join the EU. Opinion polls have shown that support for EU membership has been stable at 80 percent for many years. The liberal opposition characterizes the parliamentary vote as a choice between the EU and Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, to which the ruling party of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili is loyal. He made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, and since coming to power in 2012, the Georgian Dream party has gradually shifted to a more pro-Russian position, although it still officially supports Georgia's membership in the European Union. The Georgian Dream-dominated legislature has passed a new anti-democratic law requiring groups that receive 20% or more of their funding from abroad to register as 'agents of foreign influence'. This Putinesque law is reminiscent of what is happening in Russia and, more broadly, the Soviet Union. The government passed a massive anti-LGBTQ+ law earlier this month, banning same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and changing one's gender on identity documents. Ivanishvili claims that only his party can keep the peace, and accuses the West of trying to provoke Georgia into conflict with Russia. He is tapping into the deep fears of the population. His goal: a constitutional two-thirds majority in parliament for the Georgian Dream. Senior party members warn that the opposition, backed by the West, is trying to stage a coup. The opposition fears vote rigging and complains of pressure on voters critical of the government and attacks on its political leaders. High Dissatisfaction with All Parties The true mood of the population is unclear. Both pro-government and opposition media have published polls showing majorities in favor of their respective parties. The respected Caucasus Research Resource Center (CRRC) published data on Georgian views a year ago. At that time, 62% said that none of the parties represented their interests. 52% felt that members of parliament did not represent their interests. A pre-election survey by the McCain Institute, named after the late U.S. Senator John McCain, concluded that the ruling party could count on a 'healthy majority. The problem is that the liberal parties have not united as a solid bloc. They are generally weak in the polls and even fear for their survival after the election. The confrontation between the ruling party and the opposition is increasingly overshadowing the real needs of the people. For years, concerns about earning a decent living and improving living conditions have been at the forefront of public opinion polls. The increasing frequency of strikes reflects this. Last week, residents of the village of Shukruti, some 300 km from Tbilisi, ended weeks of protests and hunger strikes in the capital - with no tangible results. They had been protesting the destruction of their village by mining activities and the non-payment of their salaries. A week before the parliamentary elections, the ruling party finally agreed to mediate with the mining company, but they were unable to reach an agreement. The villagers left Tbilisi in frustration. No opposition party has yet been able to translate popular concerns into a platform that the majority of the population, especially the conservative rural population, can support. The opposition has had difficulty uniting its forces, in part because the EU has made it clear that the current ruling party and its authoritarian approach will not allow the hoped-for start of accession negotiations. With a clear signal from the EU for a speedy accession process, voters would have a clear choice: vote for or against EU membership. The reluctance of many EU politicians to make such a clear statement has led people to openly question the start of accession negotiations. In July, a number of employees of Swedish casino operator Evolution Georgia went on strike to demand better working conditions and to protest the sexist attitudes of the company's management. A Facebook post by the Swedish embassy in Georgia praising the company for its excellent working conditions sparked outrage among Georgian workers. Strikes are also common at other European companies in the service sector. For example, a strike over low wages and poor working conditions hit Bolt, an Estonian company that provides ride-hailing, micromobility rental, food and grocery delivery, and car-sharing services. For the agricultural sector, the third most important in the Georgian economy, the EU is an extremely difficult market to penetrate and establish. Even the world-renowned producers of Georgian wine struggle in the highly competitive European market. It is easier - and with lower quality requirements - to sell wine to China and Russia. Therefore, the ruling party's warnings that the pro-European parties could impose sanctions on Russia, which remains an important market for many Georgian companies, fall on fertile ground, even though these parties did not make such campaign promises. Given the high level of dissatisfaction with all parties and the indecisiveness of voters, the outcome of the election appears to be open. However, even before the polls opened, both the ruling party and the liberal opposition, including President Salome Zurabishvili, predicted defeat for their respective opponents and refused to accept the results. Foreign Influence The government has indicated that it will respond to any protests with force. Ivanishvili has even announced legal action against former President Mikheil Saakashvili's party, the United National Movement (UNM, now led by Tina Bokuchava), which he claims has committed numerous crimes against the Georgian state and people. Ivanishvili has consistently claimed that 'external forces' control the UNM, making its continued participation in Georgian political life unacceptable. The October 26 elections were to serve as a kind of 'Nuremberg political trial' for the UNM. The days and possibly weeks following the election are expected to be tumultuous, creating an environment conducive to foreign influence and potential intervention. The head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergei Naryshkin, has repeatedly commented on the upcoming elections in Georgia. He has accused the United States of trying to deny the Georgian Dream another term in office. In August, he said that Russia would prevent another 'color revolution,' a type of nonviolent protest aimed at changing government and society that has taken place in some post-Soviet states. The U.S. State Department, of course, categorically denied the accusation. With Russia looming large in the background, it is certain that Putin will do everything in his power to prevent peaceful protests from bringing about a change of government, as was the case in Armenia in 2018. Georgian opposition politicians have also expressed concern about a scenario similar to the fraudulent August 9 presidential election in Belarus, where the Lukashenka regime repressed tens of thousands of Belarusians.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-55DCJfxBNTC	2024-10-26T16:01:52-07:00	
The Lingering Dilemma Of Kashmir – OpEd	The Kashmir conflict, one of the most complex and enduring territorial disputes in modern history, continues to shape the geopolitical landscape of South Asia. At the heart of this seven-decade-long issue is a broken promise: the unimplemented plebiscite that was meant to allow the people of Jammu and Kashmir to decide their future. Following the partition of British India in 1947, Jammu and Kashmir, a princely state with a Muslim majority but ruled by a Hindu monarch, became a point of contention between the newly formed India and Pakistan. In October 1947, faced with an invasion by tribal fighters from Pakistan, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh, signed an Instrument of Accession to India in exchange for military assistance. This led to the first Indo-Pak war. As the conflict escalated, India brought the matter to the United Nations, which in 1948 called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Pakistani forces from the region. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed resolutions stipulating that the future of Kashmir would be determined by a plebiscite in which the people of the region would choose between joining India or Pakistan. This plebiscite, however, has never taken place, leaving the status of Kashmir unresolved. The failure to implement this democratic process has had profound consequences for the region, with Kashmir caught in a perpetual state of conflict. For the Kashmiri people, it has meant decades of political uncertainty, military occupation, and human rights abuses. For India and Pakistan, it has been the root cause of three wars, numerous military skirmishes, and a constant state of tension that affects all aspects of their bilateral relations. Over the decades, the conflict has evolved from a territorial dispute between two nations into a deeply entrenched political and social issue within Kashmir itself. The promise of a plebiscite is not just about choosing between India and Pakistan; it symbolizes the right of the Kashmiri people to determine their own future, a fundamental principle of self-determination recognized in international law. The continued denial of this right has exacerbated the grievances of the Kashmiri population, leading to widespread disillusionment with both India and Pakistan, as well as with the international community for failing to uphold its commitments. The strategic importance of Kashmir, due to its location between India, Pakistan, and China, further complicates the issue. Both India and Pakistan view control over Kashmir as vital to their national security and identity. For India, Kashmir is seen as an integral part of its secular, multi-ethnic state, while for Pakistan, Kashmir is the unfinished business of Partition, where a Muslim-majority region was expected to accede to a Muslim-majority country. In recent years, the situation in Kashmir has deteriorated further. India has increasingly asserted its control over the region, particularly following the revocation of Article 370 in August 2019, which stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special autonomous status. Pakistan, on the other hand, continues to support the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination and has called for renewed international attention to the unresolved conflict. The UN resolutions calling for a plebiscite remain a key point in Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts, though the international community’s interest in actively mediating the conflict has waned over time. The plebiscite may seem like a relic of the past, but it holds the key to a just and lasting resolution that honors the rights and aspirations of the Kashmiri people. Without a genuine effort to resolve the Kashmir conflict through peaceful and democratic means, the region will continue to be a flashpoint for violence and instability, not only between India and Pakistan but also within Kashmir itself. The international community, particularly the United Nations, bears a moral responsibility to ensure that promises made are kept and that the people of Kashmir are given the opportunity to determine their own future. In conclusion, the failure to hold the plebiscite remains a central grievance in the Kashmir conflict. It represents a broken promise that continues to fuel discontent, violence, and instability in the region. Addressing this unresolved issue is crucial for lasting peace in South Asia, and it is incumbent upon the international community to ensure that the people of Kashmir are granted their right to self-determination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-wulz_C_QcFW	2024-10-26T15:58:02-07:00	
Revitalizing Franco-Moroccan Ties: A Partnership For The Future –...	As President Emmanuel Macron embarks on a landmark visit to Morocco, hopes are high for a revived and reenergized Franco-Moroccan partnership. This visit is not just ceremonial; it marks a crucial shift toward deeper cooperation, strategic alignment, and economic synergy between these two historical allies. After three years of diplomatic strain, exacerbated by disputes over Western Sahara, immigration, and visa restrictions, the invitation from King Mohammed VI signals a fresh chapter in Franco-Moroccan relations. Both leaders are keenly aware that their bond, rooted in shared history and enduring cultural ties, deserves a renewed ambition. Macron's visit, filled with symbolism and high-level agreements, offers a foundation for that ambition. Moroccan Sahara: A Game Changer in Regional Stability Perhaps the most significant development in this rapprochement is France's recent shift on the Western Sahara issue. When the United States recognized Morocco's sovereignty over the territory, the ball was in Europe's court to respond. Macron's acknowledgment of Morocco's sovereignty over Moroccan Sahara represents a breakthrough. By endorsing Rabat's stance, France reaffirms its commitment to regional stability, supporting Morocco's role as a mediator in North Africa and the Sahel. This endorsement has regional implications, signaling to other European nations the importance of a united front in support of Morocco's territorial integrity, even as it prompts tension with Algeria. A Shared Approach to Migration Migration, another point of contention, holds particular weight for both nations. With the rise of far-right politics in Europe and the challenges of integration, immigration remains a critical issue. France's policy of visa restrictions, initially aimed at encouraging cooperation, left a bitter aftertaste in Morocco. This visit promises a shift: Macron's administration aims to rebuild trust by approaching immigration diplomatically, focusing on cooperative solutions rather than punitive measures. French officials now advocate for open dialogue and a stronger framework for joint migration management, recognizing that only a balanced approach will yield lasting results. Morocco: Europe's Gateway to Africa France's engagement with Morocco goes beyond bilateral matters; it is a strategic investment in the region. Morocco's role as a 'hub' between Europe and Africa offers France a gateway to the continent. The kingdom's robust infrastructure, from advanced ports to modern transportation networks, positions it as a prime partner for Europe's future economic ambitions in Africa. France understands this potential, seeing Morocco not only as a regional ally but as a bridge to broader African engagement. As Morocco gears up to host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations and co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup, these events present opportunities for France to offer its expertise in infrastructure and event management. French companies have long been leaders in these sectors, and the potential for collaboration on these projects is immense. Building a Resilient Economic Partnership Economic cooperation remains central to the Franco-Moroccan alliance. France is Morocco's largest foreign investor, with nearly 1,000 companies operating in the kingdom, representing key industries from technology to defense. The economic partnership stands poised for expansion, with discussions on defense contracts—including potential purchases of Airbus helicopters by Morocco's Armed Forces. Such agreements could fortify Morocco's defense capabilities while bolstering France's role as a trusted supplier. However, France must stay attuned to shifting dynamics. China and Spain are expanding their influence, challenging France's economic footprint in the region. To stay competitive, France needs to leverage its technological edge, particularly in renewable energy, a sector critical to Morocco's future. By aligning with Morocco's ambitious energy goals, France can solidify its presence in one of North Africa's fastest-growing markets. Embracing a Common Vision for the Future As Macron's visit unfolds, it is clear that the Franco-Moroccan relationship is evolving. No longer bound solely by history, this partnership is set to tackle the challenges of the 21st century—energy security, migration, economic development, and regional stability. The shared vision emerging from this visit promises a deeper, more resilient alliance grounded in mutual respect and strategic cooperation. This renewed partnership holds lessons for the rest of Europe. In a time of global uncertainty, Morocco and France are modeling a relationship built on pragmatism, shared interests, and respect for sovereignty. France's embrace of Morocco as a strategic partner serves as a blueprint for European engagement across Africa, offering a vision of collaboration that transcends traditional diplomacy. President Macron's visit may well go down in history as the moment Franco-Moroccan relations were reborn. As both nations look toward the next 30 years, they carry the weight of their shared past—and the promise of a common future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-yPbNtJYvzz5	2024-10-26T15:55:30-07:00	
Diplomatic Fallout: The Implications Of India-Canada Relations – ...	In recent weeks, the diplomatic landscape between India and Canada has been sharply defined by accusations and counterclaims, shedding light on the underlying hegemonic ambitions of the Indian state. The ongoing diplomatic spat escalated when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of being involved in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist in Canada. This incident has not only strained bilateral relations but has also raised questions about India’s intentions on the global stage and its willingness to act unilaterally to advance its geopolitical agenda. Trudeau’s assertions were met with swift denials from India’s government, which accused Canadian authorities of failing to address criminal activities allegedly committed by individuals connected to the Khalistan movement. India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman, Randhir Jaiswal, argued that Canada had not provided any evidence to substantiate its allegations, thus deflecting accountability onto Canadian law enforcement and government policies. The crux of this diplomatic debacle revolves around a broader pattern of Indian behavior that suggests a willingness to resort to extraterritorial measures against perceived threats, particularly those associated with Sikh separatism. At the heart of this dispute lies the longstanding issue of the Khalistan movement, which seeks an independent Sikh state in Punjab, India. India has consistently labeled supporters of this movement as terrorists, arguing that their activities threaten the country’s sovereignty. As a result, the Indian government has engaged in a campaign to silence dissent among its diaspora, particularly in Canada, where a significant Sikh population resides. This approach reflects India’s hegemonic tendencies, which prioritize national integrity over the principles of sovereignty and human rights. The allegations of state-sponsored extrajudicial actions in Canada not only breach international norms but also highlight India’s willingness to undermine diplomatic protocols in pursuit of its geopolitical ambitions. The implications of this diplomatic fallout for Canada-India relations are profound. The Canadian government, under Trudeau, must navigate a complex landscape where it balances economic interests with ethical imperatives in protecting its citizens. In recent years, Canada and India have cultivated a burgeoning relationship characterized by trade agreements and shared interests in technology and defense. However, the current crisis poses significant challenges to these cooperative efforts. The deepening rift raises the specter of economic repercussions; Canadian businesses may become hesitant to engage in trade with a country accused of extraterritorial aggression. Furthermore, the allegations have incited public sentiment in Canada, particularly among the Sikh community, which has rallied in support of Nijjar and against perceived Indian overreach. This backlash could pressure the Canadian government to adopt a more confrontational stance toward India, potentially jeopardizing ongoing negotiations related to trade and immigration. As Canadian lawmakers deliberate on how to respond, the complexities of this situation will undoubtedly play a critical role in shaping future diplomatic interactions. In an analytical context, some observers argue that Canada’s handling of the crisis could have been more strategic. Critics note that the Canadian government’s immediate public allegations against India may have escalated tensions unnecessarily, thereby complicating diplomatic dialogue. This stance has been echoed by analysts such as Dr. Shada Islam, a prominent scholar on international relations, who cautioned that 'Canada must tread carefully to ensure that its approach does not further alienate a critical global partner while also upholding its values of justice and human rights.' The accusations have also strained existing agreements, notably the Canada-India Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA), which has been under negotiation for several years. The specter of escalating tensions could hinder progress on this front, as trade agreements typically require a stable political relationship to thrive. Additionally, Canada’s burgeoning tech and innovation sectors could suffer setbacks as India’s reputation as a reliable partner comes into question. The risk of retaliation by the Indian government could further complicate matters, leading to potential restrictions on Canadian businesses operating in India. In light of these developments, it is crucial to analyze the broader implications for international relations. India’s actions in Canada reflect a pattern of behavior that raises questions about its commitment to respecting the sovereignty of other nations. The Indian government’s willingness to engage in alleged state-sponsored operations abroad suggests a concerning trajectory that could undermine regional stability in South Asia and beyond. As India positions itself as a rising global power, its hegemonic aspirations may lead to increased tensions with other states, particularly those that host significant diasporas with historical ties to separatist movements. In conclusion, the recent crisis between India and Canada underscores the complexities of modern diplomacy, where allegations of extrajudicial actions have profound implications for bilateral relations. India’s hegemonic tendencies have emerged as a central theme in this dispute, raising critical questions about its role on the global stage. As Canada grapples with the fallout of these allegations, the future of their relationship remains uncertain, with potential consequences for trade, immigration, and regional stability. The need for a renewed commitment to diplomatic engagement, mutual respect, and adherence to international norms has never been more pressing, as both nations seek to navigate this turbulent landscape together. Only through constructive dialogue and cooperation can they hope to rebuild trust and chart a path forward that respects the principles of sovereignty and human rights. The evolving dynamics of India-Canada relations will require vigilance and thoughtful consideration as both nations attempt to reconcile their interests and values amidst a backdrop of geopolitical challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-19R-LfGYFIe	2024-10-26T15:53:17-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Target Iranian Military Sites Amid Rising Tens...	Israel recently launched a large-scale airstrike operation targeting military installations in Iran, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. Reports indicate that over 100 Israeli aircraft, including F-35 fighter jets, flew approximately 2,000 km to conduct the mission, which struck about 20 targets across Iran. These targets reportedly included missile production facilities, air defense systems, UAV factories, and missile launch bases. According to sources, Israel's advanced F-35 jets entered Iranian airspace for the first time, flying over Tehran and targeting areas near the capital. The Israeli Air Force is believed to have fired missiles from Jordanian airspace, with some missiles reportedly launched from Iraq. However, Iran claims that its air defense successfully intercepted most projectiles, preventing significant damage. The timing of the attack was critical; Moscow reportedly provided Iran with intelligence about potential Israeli strikes only hours beforehand, giving Iran limited preparation time. In response to the attack, Iran temporarily suspended all flights and reinforced its air defenses. Iranian authorities stated, 'Israel will face a proportional response for any hostile action.' The incident underscores the fragile balance in the region, as both countries engage in heightened military posturing. As of now, no major casualties or extensive damage has been reported, but the operation has left both sides on high alert.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI--WORjVcR0c0	2024-10-26T15:51:33-07:00	
Why Did Pakistan Fail To Secure BRICS Membership At 2024 Summit? ...	Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted the first-ever summit of BRICS+ from October 22 to 24, 2024 in the Tatarstan city of Kazan. There, the founding members of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) formally welcomed five new members – Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Putin also invited more than two dozen other countries that had applied for or were considering membership in the expanding club. The 2024 BRICS+ Summit served as a powerful reminder of the growing influence of the BRICS bloc on the global stage. As BRICS expanded its membership and strengthened its goals for economic cooperation and global influence, one nation’s absence drew attention – Pakistan. Despite its geopolitical importance and interest in joining, Pakistan remained outside of BRICS+, while the organization included new members from the Middle East and other regions. Therefore, understanding the reasons behind this exclusion highlights both the priorities of BRICS and the strategic challenges Pakistan faces in meeting the bloc’s membership criteria. One of the foremost reasons for Pakistan’s exclusion is its longstanding and complex relationship with India, a founding BRICS member. The two countries share decades of unresolved tensions that have frequently spilled into global forums. India’s influence within BRICS grants it significant power in shaping the bloc’s direction, and the organization operates on a consensus-driven model, meaning that each member has considerable say in decisions, including on expansion. Admitting Pakistan, with whom India has frequent diplomatic friction, would risk disrupting the unity and cohesion that BRICS members value. In recent years, BRICS has emphasized internal harmony, as well as shared goals for economic and strategic growth, making Pakistan’s entry a potential risk to this cohesion. Without a meaningful improvement in India-Pakistan relations, India’s position on Pakistan’s membership is unlikely to change soon, leaving the door to BRICS membership closed for now. Another critical factor is Pakistan’s economic instability. BRICS has consistently prioritized members with emerging, stable economies capable of contributing to the organization’s goal of financial independence from Western influence, exemplified by its establishment of the New Development Bank and initiatives aimed at de-dollarization. Unfortunately, Pakistan’s economic challenges – including high inflation, debt dependence, and reliance on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for stabilization funds contradict the BRICS model of financial sovereignty and resilience. Recent admissions to BRICS+, including economically strong and resource-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, reflect BRICS’s preference for financially robust members who can bring stability and autonomy. Pakistan, in contrast, currently faces significant economic vulnerability, which does not align with BRICS’s economic priorities and could potentially introduce unwanted financial risks to the bloc. BRICS’s choice to admit new members, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran, is also indicative of the organization’s strategic orientation toward strengthening its influence in critical areas, such as energy and global trade. These recent members bring significant economic influence and energy resources, thereby supporting BRICS’s goals for self-sufficiency and a more substantial economic presence on the world stage. While Pakistan holds strategic importance in South Asia, it does not yet offer the same economic or energy-based leverage as the newly admitted members. Until Pakistan can more closely align its priorities and strategic alliances with BRICS’s goals, its application for membership will likely remain in question. Domestic instability in Pakistan further compounds its membership challenges. BRICS members value political stability as a foundation for sustained cooperation and growth, and Pakistan’s political landscape has been marked by frequent upheaval, security concerns, and social unrest. These internal challenges present Pakistan as a country needing significant reform, and the image of political volatility contrasts with BRICS’s preference for stable, resilient partners. For Pakistan to gain serious consideration for BRICS membership, it would need to achieve greater stability, both politically and socially, and demonstrate sound governance capable of supporting international initiatives without domestic distractions. While Pakistan’s current position may appear limiting, it is not without potential avenues to improve its prospects for future BRICS membership. First, better diplomatic relations with India could address a significant barrier. Confidence-building measures and regional dialogue could gradually improve Pakistan’s image and reduce the tension that currently restricts it from joining. Additionally, Pakistan’s economic model would benefit from addressing structural challenges to reduce its reliance on international bailouts, adopting fiscal policies that foster sustainability, and focusing on the development of domestic industries to align more closely with BRICS’s preference for financial independence. Another possible step forward is for Pakistan to align its strategic policies with BRICS’s goals of global financial reform and reduced dependence on Western institutions. Aligning with the organization’s objectives in terms of trade and economic cooperation would enhance Pakistan’s appeal. Further, political stability is paramount, as domestic reforms in governance, security, and social structures could help Pakistan meet the expectations BRICS has for new members. By stabilizing its internal landscape, Pakistan could project itself as a reliable and cooperative partner that aligns with BRICS’s overarching goals of economic autonomy and political cohesion. The 2024 BRICS+ Summit demonstrated the bloc’s commitment to cautious and strategic expansion, prioritizing members who reinforce its economic strength and geopolitical influence. For Pakistan, achieving BRICS membership is not simply a matter of interest; it requires a reorientation of both domestic and foreign policy. This includes not only improving relations with India and addressing economic vulnerabilities but also adopting a governance model that aligns with BRICS’s values of resilience and autonomy. Pakistan’s path to BRICS membership is challenging but not impossible. With a concentrated focus on these areas, it could one day align itself with the organization’s priorities, potentially opening the door to membership in future summits. Until then, Pakistan’s exclusion underscores the high standards BRICS holds for its members as it continues to redefine the framework for global cooperation in the 21st century.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-2eAz6S70lLV	2024-10-26T15:49:47-07:00	
Bringing The Space–Nuclear Nexus Into Multilateral Discussions – ...	By Nivedita Raju and Sarah Erickson In February 2024, United States government officialsclaimedto haveintelligencethat Russia was developing anuclearcapability intended to target satellites. This sparkedrampant speculationand concern about whether the reports indicated asignificant threat. The controversy, and a contentious process that followed in the United Nations Security Council, highlighted the urgent need to better understand the nexus between activities in outer space and nuclear weapons and to address these topics at a multilateral level. An increasing number of state and non-state actors are involved in the operation of space systems, which provide a wide range of services, both civilian and military—including in the nuclear domain. This has major implications for stability and security, not least given the growing escalation risks at the space–nuclear nexus. However, even within multilateral processes and bodies that might appear best equipped to link the two issues, outer space and nuclear weapons tend to be examined separately. This essay briefly summarizes the potential escalation risks at the space–nuclear nexus. It then considers some of the difficulties in discussing this nexus in existing multilateral forums and suggests ways to overcome them. The space–nuclear nexus The 1967Outer Space Treatyestablishes a legal prohibition on placing nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in orbit. While no state is known to have violated this prohibition so far, there are other ways in which developments in space systems and nuclear capabilities may interact to create dangerous escalation risks. Nuclear-armed statesrely onspace systems, to varying degrees, for functions such as early warning of a missile attack; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); verification under nuclear arms control agreements; relaying communications within a state’s nuclear chain of command; and positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) services, which can support precision-strike weapons and missile guidance. Space systems can therefore be considered a critical enabler and force-multiplier in military operations. Attacks on these systems can consequently undermine a state’s deterrence capabilities, constituting a fundamental national security threat and inviting an escalatory response. The possibility of escalation is especially concerning as so-called counterspacecapabilities(capabilities designed to destroy, disable or otherwise interfere with space systems) that can hold such strategically relevant space systems under threat are being developed by several actors. Counterspace capabilities are not comprehensively banned by the current international framework governing space activities, meaning that there is noclear red lineprohibiting attacks on space systems that enable nuclear missions. However, the doctrines of some nuclear-armed states open the door for nuclear use to be considered as a response to such an attack. The strategic ambiguity around such attacks, or even the threat of them, contributes directly to the potential for escalation at the space–nuclear nexus. The situation is complicated further by the fact that some space systems can be used to enable both nuclear and non-nuclear missions. This phenomenon is referred to as a form ofentanglementby some experts. For example, if a state’s early-warning satellites are attacked during a conventional confrontation, this could harm not only its ability to defend against conventionally armed missiles but also its defence against nuclear missiles. Thus, the state may respond as if the attack had targeted its nuclear capabilities, regardless of the attacker’s intent. Depending on the scenario, a state could also knowingly attack a space system and assume that any escalatory response would be limited to conventional weapons, which may not be the case. The ‘hard’ security concerns related to the space–nuclear nexus also need to be balanced against the many beneficial, often essential, economic, social and environmental functions that space systems serve. Any negotiations towards a risk-reduction framework related to the space–nuclear nexus need to take into account preventing or minimizing negative impacts on these peaceful functions. For all these reasons, shared understanding on the space–nuclear nexus, particularly escalation risks and how to reduce them, is essential for the future of global security. The state of multilateral deliberations on nuclear weapons and space security In response to the US claims about a Russian nuclear anti-satellite capability discussed above, the UN Security Council convened in April 2024 to vote on adraft resolutionjointly proposed by Japan and the USA. The draft not only reaffirmed the Outer Space Treaty prohibition on nuclear weapons in space, but also called on states to refrain from developing WMD designed to be placed in orbit or stationed in space in any manner. China and Russia then introduced anamendmentthat significantly expanded the scope, committing states to ‘take urgent measures to prevent for all time the placement of weapons in outer space and the threat or use of force in outer space, from space against Earth and from Earth against objects in outer space’ and to negotiate legally binding instruments to that effect. The amendment was not adopted, and Russia exercised its veto power to reject the original proposed resolution, arguing that the resolution was not a balanced approach to space security. In May, China and Russia then introduced their owndraft resolution. This included language on prohibiting the development of WMD designed for deployment in space as well as language similar to their proposed amendment. This draft fell short of the required number of votes to pass. The Security Council’s failure to adopt either resolution and the fact that it is not an inclusive negotiating body strongly suggest that it is not the best body to tackle the growing challenges of the space–nuclear nexus at the multilateral level, despite its broad security mandate. A number of other UN processes and forums currently discuss governance of the space or nuclear domains, and sometimes both. Yet in practice, none have thus far addressed the space–nuclear nexus, and none have shown themselves to be particularly well equipped to deal with cross-domain issues. Three UN bodies might at first sight look like good candidates: theConference on Disarmament(CD), the UN Disarmament Commission and the UN General Assembly’s First Committee. All convene annually. The CD has several agenda items, including on ‘prevention of nuclear war, including all related matters’ and ‘prevention of an arms race in outer space’ (PAROS). However, despite someminimal progressthis year, the CD has beendeadlockedfor many years due to geopolitical divisions and disagreements over agenda priorities and procedural rules. Introducing new themes may thus be premature. The UN Disarmament Commission has a general mandate to discuss disarmament questions and in 2023 deliberatedtransparency and confidence-building measures (TCBMs) in outer space. The First Committee also holds general thematic debates on nuclear weapons, other WMD and space, among other topics. However, both the Disarmament Commission and the First Committee have limited capacity for detailed discussion on cross-domain issues. Furthermore, the First Committee is dominated by national statements and prioritizes work on adopting resolutions and decisions. Thus, none of the three forums could easily hold substantive discussion on risks at the space–nuclear nexus, a nascent topic that at this stage requires more informal and interactive exchange. Increasing the capacity of states to engage on these matters is a prerequisite to pursuing convergence towards the drafting of resolutions and negotiations of treaties meant for those forums. For space governance, theCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space(COPUOS) covers issues pertaining to the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, but explicit security-focused items are not included in its agenda of work. There isno comprehensive established regimeto discuss security matters in outer space nor is there a review conference or annual meeting focusing on implementation of the Outer Space Treaty. Due to this gap, various time-bound processes have been initiated dedicated to space security—for example, the2019 UN Group of Governmental Experts(GGE) on further practical measures on PAROS, the2023 Open-ended Working Group(OEWG) on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours, and the2024 GGEon further practical measures on PAROS. Their results have been mixed, depending on the political will and constructive engagement of participants. For example, of the three, only the 2024 GGE was able to adopt aconsensus report. For nuclear issues, the UN has mandated review conferences and preparatory committees under the 1968Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and meetings of states parties for the 2017Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons(TPNW). These regimes allow states to regularly consider nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Yet the meetings associated with these regimes centre on treaty implementation. The inability of NPT states parties to reach consensus on final documents since 2010 makes it difficult for them to consider broad developments in other domains that may impact on nuclear risk. Meanwhile, the limited membership of the TPNW, which does not include any nuclear-armed states, provides an impediment to considering space–nuclear risk in that context. These forums also face constant challenges related to resources. Many states do not have the capacity—in terms of personnel, expertise, time or funds—to engage actively in all of them. The limited attention paid to the space–nuclear nexus in existing multilateral forums may also be attributed to a desire by states to maintain distinct processes. Given the already challenging security landscape, adding new developments related to these topics in focused forums (whether in the space or nuclear domains) may be seen as prohibitive to achieving any results, especially in the light of the requirement for consensus in some of them and the sensitive political history between outer space, missile defenceand links to strategic stability. However, this inattention has greatly limited states’ ability to have a multilateral conversation on space–nuclear risk at all, let alone to prioritize a common nuclear risk-reduction agenda involving outer space. Creating multilateral spaces to discuss risks at the space–nuclear nexus How might states and other actors help to facilitate discussion of escalation risks at the intersection of space and nuclear issues? Below are three suggested starting points. Raise the space–nuclear nexus in ad hoc space security processes In 2023 the UN General Assembly adopted two resolutions establishing new OEWGs: one on further practical measures on PAROS (resolution78/238) and one on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours (resolution78/20). These are due to convene soon, although the General Assembly will shortly decide whether to merge the two. With enough shared interest among a coalition of states, the space–nuclear nexus could be included as a topic area for consideration in such processes, as was done for other topics in the OEWG on reducing space threats—for example, ‘protecting critical space-based services to civilians as well as services that support humanitarian operations’. Even if there is no direct language on an issue in the mandate of a process or negotiating body, states have the prerogative to share their security perspectives and concerns. Therefore, a feasible and immediate step, especially considering the future OEWG(s) on space security scheduled to commence, is for states participating in such processes to bring the issue to the attention of others through working papers (possibly also through coalitions or partnerships), statements, side events and other informational activities. Raise the space–nuclear nexus in existing nuclear processes The NPT must be considered as a venue for space–nuclear nexus issues, despite its limitations. While it excludes nuclear-armed states (and space powers) that are not parties to the treaty, it has already managed to raise other relevant intersecting topics, such as the cyber–nuclear nexus. Thechair’s summaryof the 2024 NPT Preparatory Committee notes that some states ‘also expressed support for further work by the nuclear-weapon States on risk reduction measures, including to mitigate the potential for emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence and offensive cyber capabilities, to multiply nuclear risks’. In future NPT meetings, states could include counterspace capabilities alongside other listed emerging technologies that multiply nuclear risks. Additionally, there is potential to discuss the space–nuclear nexus under the TPNW, given its focus on the humanitarian consequences and environmental impacts of nuclear weapon use. Yet there is less research on direct and indirect impacts of potential nuclear use in outer space. Engaging with the Scientific Advisory Group established by the TPNW would be useful in this and other ways. The group is mandated to review relevant research, including on technological developments that may have implications for nuclear risks, humanitarian consequences and nuclear disarmament overall. While research through this group may be limited to the TPNW states parties, it would nonetheless drive engagement, particularly in developing research agendas and related mandates on the space–nuclear nexus. Increase cross-cutting engagement on the nexus, in both formal and informal processes In order to have meaningful and productive multilateral debate, states need to be well informed about the escalation risks, as well as the potential humanitarian and environmental ramifications of developments at the space–nuclear nexus. The 2002Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation(HCOC) can strengthen understanding of the space–nuclear nexus by encouraging discussions during its annual Regular Meetings.While it is a voluntary instrument and not all states are subscribing parties, the HCOC is particularly relevant to the space–nuclear nexus, as it considersboth domains. Under the HCOC, states commit to providing others with notifications ahead of launching either ballistic missiles (capable of delivering WMD) and space-launch vehicles, or test flights of either, along with annual reports on their relevant policies. Outside governmental processes, there is additionally a role for experts and civil society in building up relevant knowledge and raising global awareness. Facilitating dialogue bycreating spacesoutside official forums where the space and nuclear communities, including those in civil society, can exchange views and knowledge is vital. Also important isregion-specific dialogue, as nuclear risks differ between contexts. Policy communities can encourage these efforts and, as appropriate, actively engage with them. Ultimately, attacks on space systems may trigger or fuel escalation towards nuclear use, which would have devastating consequences for all. It is critical to address the space–nuclear nexus at the multilateral level. About the authors: Nivedita Rajuisa Researcher inthe SIPRIWeapons of Mass Destruction Programme.

Flags At Nigerian Protests Could Signal Russian Plans To Expand I...	After forming alliances with military-led juntas in the Sahel, Russia might be moving its influence campaign south by supporting social unrest in Nigeria. During a 10-day August protest demanding better governance, some demonstrators in the northwestern city of Kano suddenly produced Russian flags and called on Russia to pressure the federal government for regime change. Authorities arrested 90 people for waving or making Russian flags. Nigerian Chief of Defense Gen. Christopher Musa told reporters the government would not accept citizens flying foreign flags. 'We will not accept anyone pushing for a change of government,' Musa said. Injecting Russian sentiment into domestic protests has become a standard ploy by Russian operatives in Africa, according to Joseph Siegle, director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS) in Washington, D.C. 'The pattern of how Russia has been able to weaponize and hijack protests for its own political objectives is underappreciated on the continent,' Siegle told PassBlue, which covers the United Nations. 'It’s clearly an effort to foment unrest and manipulate authentic grievances.' The risk, Siegle said, is that Russian influence in Nigeria could cause isolated protests to expand into nation-crippling unrest. 'This is exactly the pattern we saw in Mali in the 18 months prior to the coup,' he said. Russia is a major purveyor of disinformation across Africa, particularly in the Sahel. Studies have shown that Russia accounts for 40% of disinformation on social media and fake news outlets. The African countries where Russia is active score an average of 22 out of 100 on Freedom House’s measure of access to political rights and civil liberties. African countries, on average, score 43. The ACSS estimates that Russian influence has stunted or derailed democratic progress in two dozen African countries. Russian disinformation campaigns target African countries with weak democratic institutions. Before Mali’s 2021 military coup, a Russian disinformation campaign undermined faith in the country’s elected government, which had been unable to defeat a Tuareg insurgency for many years. After the coup, the ruling junta quickly invited Russian Wagner Group mercenaries, now Africa Corps, to enter the country as 'trainers.' The mercenaries since have raided communities, executed people and violated human rights. Russia has had a similar influence in neighboring Burkina Faso and, more recently, Niger, which borders six Nigerian states to the north. Burkina Faso and Niger are ruled by juntas that overthrew democratic governments. 'So, when you see Russian flags in Nigeria, there is an obvious link to what Russia has done elsewhere,' Siegle told PassBlue. Russia has paired its military influence in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger with mining operations that target the Sahel’s most valuable national resources, including gold and uranium. Russian forces have followed a similar pattern in the Central African Republic, Libya and Sudan. Nigeria experienced five military coups between 1960 and 1999, but Nigeria’s 218 million people have lived under a multiparty democracy for 25 years. Nigeria’s northern states have a long historical, cultural and economic relationship with Niger. The regions share a largely Muslim, Hausa-speaking population. The northern states have lived for decades under the threat of terrorism from Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province. A study by the Observatory for Religious Freedom in Africa reported that nearly 56,000 people were killed in Nigeria in about 10,000 attacks from October 2019 to September 2023. More than 21,000 people were kidnapped during that same period. Observers worry the insecurity across northern Nigeria echoes the situation in the Sahelian countries, raising the potential for greater Russian influence in that region. Some see Russia’s recent attempt to develop influence in northern Nigeria as the precursor to an attempt to exploit gold resources in Zamfara State. 'Protests are a normal democratic act to demand change,' Siegle said. 'These are the very acts being hijacked by an external actor … which has been Russia’s key means of entry and influence in Africa.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO8_b2zlU8YvJ	2024-10-25T17:11:46-07:00	
Israel Launches Air Strikes In Iran	Israel has launched air strikes against targets in Iran, with the Israel Defense Forces announcing on social media that it was in 'response to months of continuous attacks'by the Iranian regime. 'Right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,' the IDF statement on X said. Iran’s state TV said several strong explosions heard around the capital, but there was no official comment about the source of explosions. Local mediareported about loud explosions in the nearby city of Karaj city early on Saturday. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic-missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, Tehran’s second direct attack on Israel in six months. In its statement, the IDF said: 'The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th—on seven fronts—including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. 'Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO4U0VkLp0ZGj	2024-10-25T17:09:54-07:00	
Exchange Rate Uncertainty Endangers Japan’s Economic Stability – ...	By Gunther Schnabl In early August 2024, Japan played a prominent role in a global financial mini-crash. Markets reacted violently to the unexpected July announcement of the Bank of Japan’s decision to raise the key interest rate and halve its monthly bond purchases. That announcement preceded disappointing US employment figures, triggering expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The yen’s sudden appreciation forced many carry traders to hastily dissolve their positions which in turn caused market turmoil. The Bank of Japan haspostponed further interest rate increasesgiven the market’s recovery. But the event served as a reminder that carry trades originating in Japan and the yen–dollar exchange rate significantly affect international financial stability. One possible avenue for containing ongoing inflation risk and exchange rate uncertainty is pegging the yen to the dollar. Japan’s floating yen has been a source of unrest for decades. In the early 1980s, a depreciated yen and a fast-growing trade surplus in Japan led to accusations of unfair trade practices from Japan’s trading partners. The United States repeatedly encouraged the yen’s appreciation toobtain concessionsfrom Japan in trade negotiations until the mid-1990s. When the G5 nations announced an appreciation of the yen against the dollar with the September 1985 Plaza Agreement to cure trade imbalances between Japan and the United States,it kickstarteda ‘run to the yen’. The strong appreciation of the yen threw the export-dependent economy into a deep crisis. The yen’s depreciation starting from 1995 contributed to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis by eroding the competitiveness of Japan’s neighbours like South Korea and Thailand. Japanese banks faltered having provided extensive credit to Southeast Asia. The resulting 1998 Japanese financial crisis led to the perpetuation of Japan’s low-interest rate policy and the beginning of quantitative easing. With interest rates in Japan stuck at zero, speculators increasingly engaged in carry trades — raising cheap loans in Japan and investing in regions with significantly higher interest rates. This made them vulnerable to yen appreciation. Ordinary Japanese people — such as those pegged under the famous ‘Mrs Watanabe’ stereotype of Japanese currency traders — also invested abroad as there was hardly any domestic interest income to be found. The Abenomics policies pursued from 2013 led to the control of the term structure of interest rates, pushing 10-year government bond yields to zero. As bank deposits grew and demand for credit remained sluggish, Japanese banks further extended their investment abroad. Japan’s life insurance companies and pension funds have accumulated large foreign assets, especially in the United States. The Government Pension Investment Fund has assets of around 246 trillion yen (US$1.7 trillion), ofwhich about half is invested abroad. Exchange rate risks are often only partially hedged because of high costs. Japan’s net foreign assets increased to around 471.3 trillion yen at the end of 2023 (US$3.4 trillion at the 31 December exchange rate) due to Japan’s status as a large exporter of capital beginning in the 1980s. The prospect of converting the country’s immense foreign assets risks apotential appreciation of the yen. Japanese banks, life insurance companies, pension funds and households have become vulnerable because any appreciation reduces the value of foreign currency assets in terms of yen. The issue has greater importance due to Japan’s rapidly ageing society. If yen appreciation expectations are strengthened, the risk of another run to the yen increases as many investors may then rush to exchange foreign currency into yen, causing valuation losses for others.Uncontrolled yen–dollar movementshave become a risk for both Japanese and global financial stability. The Bank of Japan has maintained an expansionary monetary policy for 30 years — partially in order to control appreciation pressure. Monetary expansion in the United States tended to be accompanied by even larger expansion in Japan. This approach kept the yield of 10-year Japanese government bonds substantially below that of 10-year Treasury bonds. While this policy did not cause inflation for many years, consumer price inflation has exceeded the two per cent target since 2022. The Bank of Japan facesa dilemma. Lifting interest rates to contain inflation risks an appreciation of the yen, while keeping interest rates low to prevent appreciation may cause price increases and public discontent. Unlike in the 1980s, yen deprecation now serves the interests of not only the manufacturing industry but also the financial sector and pension funds. Prime MinisterShigeru Ishibahas signalled that monetary policy must remain accommodative to support economic recovery. The global financial risks stemming from yen appreciation could justify allowing it to depreciate. The burden on Japanese consumers would then further increase. One potential solution is pegging the yen to the US dollar. This would forestall politically and economically motivated yen depreciation, as the Bank of Japan would be only committed to exchange rate stability and not to the interests of lobbying groups. Japanese consumers would be protected against higher inflation. It might also be wise to eliminate appreciation-induced financial market risks. Since uncertainty would be reduced, the exchange rate peg would make a significant contribution to Japan’s economic stabilisation. Given the Bank of Japan already has limited room to manoeuvre — evident in its recent minuscule interest rate adjustments — the loss of monetary policy independence may be more palatable.

As Inflation Recedes, Global Economy Needs Policy Triple Pivot – ...	Let’s start with the good news: it looks like the global battle against inflation has largely been won, even if price pressures persist in some countries. After peaking at 9.4 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022, we now project headline inflation will fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year, slightly below the average during the two decades before the pandemic. In most countries, inflation is now hovering close to central bank targets, paving the way for monetary easing across major central banks. The global economy remained unusually resilient throughout the disinflationary process. Growth is projected to hold steady at 3.2 percent in 2024 and 2025, but some low-income and developing economies have seen sizable downside growth revisions, often tied to intensifying conflicts. In advanced economies, growth in the United States is strong, at 2.8 percent this year, but will revert toward its potential in 2025. For advanced European economies, a modest growth rebound is expected next year, with output approaching potential. The growth outlook is very stable in emerging markets and developing economies, around 4.2 percent this year and next, with continued robust performance from emerging Asia. The decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement. AsChapter 2of our report argues, the surge and subsequent decline in inflation reflects a unique combination of shocks: broad supply disruptions coupled with strong demand pressures in the wake of the pandemic, followed by sharp spikes in commodity prices caused by the war in Ukraine. These shocks led to an upward shift and a steepening of the relationship between activity and inflation, the Phillips curve. As supply disruptions eased and tight monetary policy started to constrain demand, normalization in labor markets allowed inflation to decline rapidly without a major slowdown in activity. Clearly, much of the disinflation can be attributed to the unwinding of the shocks themselves, together with improvements in labor supply, often linked to increased immigration. But monetary policy played a decisive role by keeping inflation expectations anchored, avoiding deleterious wage-price spirals, and a repeat of the disastrous inflation experience of the 1970s. Despite the good news on inflation, downside risks are increasing and now dominate the outlook. An escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets. Shifts toward undesirable trade and industrial policies can significantly lower output relative to our baseline forecast. Monetary policy could remain too tight for too long, and global financial conditions could tighten abruptly. The return of inflation near central bank targets paves the way for a policy triple pivot. This would provide much-needed macroeconomic breathing room, at a time where risks and challenges remain elevated. The first pivot—on monetary policy—is under way already. Since June, major central banks in advanced economies have started to cut policy rates, moving toward a neutral stance. This will support activity at a time when many advanced economies’ labor markets are showing signs of cooling, with rising unemployment rates. So far, however, the rise in unemployment has been gradual and does not point to an imminent slowdown. Lower interest rates in major economies will ease the pressure on emerging market economies, with their currencies strengthening against the US dollar and financial conditions improving. This will help reduce imported inflation, allowing these countries to pursue their own disinflation path more easily. However, vigilance remains key. Inflation in services remains too elevated, almost double pre-pandemic levels. A few emerging market economies are facing a resurgence of inflationary pressures and have started to raise policy rates again. Furthermore, we have now entered a world dominated by supply disruptions—from climate, health, and geopolitical tensions. It is always harder for monetary policy to contain inflation when faced with such shocks, which simultaneously increase prices and reduce output. Finally, while inflation expectations remained well-anchored this time, it may be harder next time, as workers and firms will be more vigilant about protecting pay and profits. The second pivot is on fiscal policy. Fiscal space is a cornerstone of macroeconomic and financial stability. After years of loose fiscal policy in many countries, it is now time to stabilize debt dynamics and rebuild much-needed fiscal buffers. While the decline in policy rates provides some fiscal relief by lowering funding costs, this will not be sufficient, especially as long-term real interest rates remain far above pre-pandemic levels. In many countries, primary balances (the difference between fiscal revenues and public spending net of debt service) need to improve. For some, including the United States and China, current fiscal plans do not stabilizedebt dynamics. In many others, while early fiscal plans showed promise after the pandemic and cost-of-living crises, there are increasing signs of slippage. The path is narrow: delaying consolidation increases the risk of disorderly market-imposed adjustments, while an excessively abrupt turn toward fiscal tightening could be self-defeating and hurt economic activity. Success requires implementing a sustained and credible multi-year adjustments without delay, where consolidation is necessary. The more credible and disciplined the fiscal adjustment, the more monetary policy can play a supporting role by easing policy rates while keeping inflation in check. But the willingness or ability to deliver disciplined and credible fiscal adjustments have been lacking. The third pivot—and the hardest—is toward growth-enhancing reforms. Much more needs to be done to improve growth prospects and lift productivity, as this is the only way we can address the many challenges we face: rebuilding fiscal buffers; coping with aging and shrinking populations in many parts of the world; tackling the climate transition; increasing resilience, and improving the lives of the most vulnerable, within and across countries. Unfortunately, growth prospects for five years from now remain lackluster, at 3.1 percent, the lowest in decades. While much of this reflects China’s weaker outlook, medium-term prospects in other regions, including Latin America and the European Union, have also deteriorated. Faced with increased external competition and structural weaknesses in manufacturing and productivity, many countries are implementing industrial and trade policy measures to protect domestic workers and industries. But external imbalances often reflect macroeconomic forces: a weakening domestic demand in China, or excessive demand in the United States. Addressing these will requiresetting the macro dials appropriately. Moreover, while industrial and trade policy measures can sometimes boost investment and activity in the short run—especially when relying on debt-financed subsidies—they often lead to retaliation and fail to deliver sustained improvements in standards of living. They should be avoided when not carefully addressing well-identified market failures or narrowly defined national security concerns. Economic growth must come instead from ambitious domestic reforms that boost technology and innovation, improve competition and resource allocation, further economic integration and stimulate productive private investment. Yet while reforms are as urgent as ever, they often face significant social resistance. How can policymakers win the support they need for reforms to succeed? AsChapter 3of our report shows, information strategies can help but can only go so far. Building trust between government and citizens—a two-way process throughout the policy design—and the inclusion of proper compensation to offset potential harms, are essential features. Building trust is an important lesson that should also resonate when thinking about ways to further improve international cooperation and bolster our multilateral efforts to address common challenges, in the year that we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions. —This article is based on the October 2024 World Economic Outlook.

Trump’s Latest Tariff Plan Just Replaces One Tax With Another – O...	By Ryan McMaken Donald Trump on Mondayfloated the ideathat he might seek to replace the federal income tax with federal taxes on imports—also known as tariffs. This is potentially a good idea, but not for economic reasons. There is no economic reason why tariffs are any better or any worse than the income tax. A tariff, which is just a tax, is no less compulsory than the income tax. A tariff is no less destructive to private wealth and capital than the income tax. Contrary to various protectionist myths, Americans pay tariffs like they pay any other tax imposed by the US government. On the other hand, a tariff isn’t necessarilyworsethan an income tax. Yes, tariffs act to diminish trade, and that’s a bad thing. But income taxes do the same. When people pay taxes of any kind—whether they are income taxes or tariffs, people have less money to spend on—or invest in—everything,regardless of where it is made or located. The only reason why it might be a good thing to 'replace' income taxes with tariffs—note that we’re not being offered any significant cuts in taxesoverall—is that income taxes have always been a way for the federal government to engage in wholesale violations of individual privacy. Since the legalization of the income tax in 1913, the federal government has claimed the power to monitor every wage earner’s income. Theoretically, replacing income-tax revenue with tariff revenue would reduce the number of Americans who must report all their financial affairs to the federal government every year. That’s not an economic argument, it’s a political one, and maybe that’s reason enough to bother abolishing the income tax, even if something else replaces it. In economic terms, though, let’s not pretend replacing one tax with another makes anyone more free or better off. The Problem with Tax Reform All this talk about 'replacing' one tax with another means we’re talking about tax 'reform,' not tax abolition. Every now and then, we encounter various types of tax 'reform' such as replacing the progressive income tax with a flat tax, or replacing income taxes with a VAT tax or national sales tax. There is rarely any reason to get very excited about tax reform, because it usually just rearranges the tax burden without endangering the regime’s ability to collect huge amounts of revenue. As with most tax reform plans, the Trump proposal to replace one tax with another is based on the premise that overall tax revenue should be 'revenue neutral.' That is, the amount of tax revenue extracted from Americans will be more or less the same, and the American state will continue to have many trillions of dollars to spend each year. That’s not exactly a great blow to state power, nor does it offer any sort of boon to economic activity or the standard of living for ordinary Americans. Moreover, when it comes to Trump’s proposal, the details of what we mean by 'income tax' matter a lot. When Trump says he wants to abolish 'the income tax,' its unclear if he just means the graduated income tax, oralltaxes on income. After all, all wage earning Americans pay enormous amounts of taxes in the form ofpayrolltaxes. Payroll taxes are income taxes, and in order to collect them, the government demands access to the details of everyone’s earnings. So, any benefits in terms of added privacy and freedom will only be achievedif all taxes on income are abolished.That means no graduated income tax, no payroll taxes at all, and the abolition of all the machinery of the IRS. If Trump only abolishes the graduated income tax and replaces it with high tariffs, then our position is hardly improved. The federal government still monitors all our earnings,andwe get to pay a lot more for basic goods. That’s the sort of tax reform that is not worth caring about. For argument’s sake, though, let’s say Trump abolishes all income taxes and replaces them with tariffs—which would exactly 'replace' the revenues formerly obtained through income taxes. In terms of financial privacy, this would be a good thing for our everyday lives. Regular people who are not directly involved in international trade would generally not have to worry about the endless paperwork that comes with income taxes. That’s all to the good. Economically speaking, though, the 'reform' makes no difference. Tariffs would still be sucking trillions of dollars out of the private economy in a way similar to income taxes. Moreover, with tariffs rising to much higher levels, efforts to avoid tariffs will become much more widespread, and smuggling will become an occasion for much federal handwringing. As federal bureaucrats do now with income taxes, there will be demands for more taxpayer money to staff agents to enforce tariffs mandates. Again, this isn’t necessarily any better or worse than the situation with income taxes, but these facts are reminders that all taxes require enforcement, and tariffs are hardly some kind of kindler, gentler tax. What Real Tax Reform Would Look Like No revenue-neutral will ever make any real difference to the size and scope of the state, however. The only change that would make a real difference is a program of sizable cuts tobothtaxes and spending. Tax cuts alone will never make us better off because tax cuts without spending cuts only means bigger deficits.Bigger deficits mean more inflationary monetarypolicy and more price inflation. Tax cuts without spending cuts mean the tax burden is merely shifted from nominal taxes to the de facto tax of price inflation. If a politician claims to be a 'tax cutter,' he is not to be taken seriously unless he’s also for cutting spending. When Trump rearranges tax programs or cuts taxes while also signing off on more deficit spending, he is really raising everyone’s inflation tax. No tax 'reform' changes this.

California’s Prop 2: Unions Win, Students And Taxpayers Lose – Op...	California, where I live, is often considered a trendsetting state, providing an example that others frequently choose to follow. As a long-time resident, however, I can attest our policy examples are often very bad ones to follow, if we are to judge by their adverse effects. Proposition 2 on November’s ballot is a good example. On the surface, it appears to be a relatively standard 'we need more money for our schools' bond issue, except for its $10 billion price tag. And given the well-earned distrust voters have learned to apply toward our state government, it comes with now-standard boilerplate assurances that if it passes, things will be done right this time. The pro-Proposition 2 ballot argument claims there will be 'strict taxpayer accountability protections,' 'local control,' and assurance that the funds will be 'used efficiently.' But it comes with a hidden surprise that contradicts those promises. That surprise, not mentioned at all in the Official Voter Information Guide, is that every specific project with a Project Labor Agreement will be given preference over one without a PLA. And PLAs not only routinely discriminate against the vast majority of Californians, studies have found they inflated the costs of school construction projects by15 percent or more, and sometimesfar more, and resulted infewer total projects. When voters hear about the burdens of projects subject to PLAs, they become far less likely to vote for initiatives imposing them. The hiding is deliberate. How that was hidden is also instructive. Proposition 2 began life asAB 247in the California legislature. The PLA was included there as something the union leash-holders of California Democrats demanded as tribute (and 15 percent or more of $10 billion is a pretty hefty 'tip' for them). But even then it was still 'camouflaged' by its placement near the end of a section about a point system that would be used to compute matching funds, in order to minimize how much it was noticed. But not all of AB 247 made it to the ballot. Only the bond authorization is there as Proposition 2; the rest of the legislation takes effect if voters say yes (without ever hearing about the PLAs) to the debt. That does not seem like how one would go about producing 'strict taxpayer accountability protections,' or 'local control,' or ensuring that the funds will be 'used efficiently.' And understanding how PLAs work strongly reinforces that conclusion. PLAs are agreements typically drafted by construction unions, without any input from nonunion contractors or workers, that all bidders on particular projects must accept. They typically force union representation, includingmandatory membershipandunion feesfor all workers (including those working fornonunion employers), following union work classifications and rules, getting all workers fromunion hiring hallsand all apprentices from union apprenticeship programs, and contributing tounion benefitand multi-employer pension plans that few if any non-union members will ever get a penny from. Examiningunion claimsthat they just 'level the playing field' for all competitors reveals how discriminatory as well as inefficient they are. PLAs level the playing field only by forcing everyone to follow union-determined policies and pay union-determined wages. They give unions an overwhelming home field advantage byhandicapping nonunion firms’ ability to utilize their superior abilities. Nonunion contractors have no say in PLA negotiations. They cannot incorporate terms that allow them to use their resources most efficiently. They must give up their flexibility, as with workers who can cross highly inflexible union job boundaries. They can no longer hire nonunion apprentices. They can’t use less-skilled and -costly 'helper' workers efficiently, stymied by union limitations. They even give up the ability to choose their own workers, whom they trust and who already work well together in teams, to the requirement that all workers come through union hiring-halls. In sum, they make nonunion contractors act like union contractors while extracting fees from workers. PLAs, together with prevailing wage laws, as in California, also keep nonunion contractors from passing onlower costs to taxpayersfrom a labor force who choose market pay rates less than inflated union scales. Nonunion workers, even under a PLA that requires prevailing union wages, also take a hit. They must pay dues and contribute to union benefits without ever getting those benefits, which many already get from their employer. Those substantial deductions leave them paid less as a result. Further, the added burdens on nonunion contractors often leads them not to bid on PLA contracts, reducing the demand for nonunion contractors’ and workers’ services and the competition to win contracts. Roughly83 percent of all construction workersin California are nonunion; they share the burden imposed on taxpayers by preferential union contracts. Black,minorityandwomen’s groupsin construction oppose PLAs since the vast majority of them are nonunion. Requiring journeymen and journeyman pay for most tasks, reducing helper jobs, likewise crowds out minority workers, who are, on average, skill acquiring skills. The National Black Chamber of Commerce hascalled PLAs'a license to discriminate against black workers.' All of those inefficiencies and inequities produce higher costs. They also run up against some embarrassing questions. Should taxpayers be charged more for school projects, just to ensure public funds flow only to Democrats’ supporters? Why are the vast majority of construction industry workers in non-union organizations, if using union organization and rules was generally superior for workers and results? Proposition 2, like most legislation favoring interest groups, punishes and extorts the many for the benefit of the influential few. Governments often find themselves beholden to special interests, prioritizing the demands of concentrated groups over the broader interests of taxpayers. When these groups provide significant financial and logistical support during elections, policymakers tend to favor their agendas, even when the resulting policies impose hidden or underappreciated costs on the public. This dynamic undermines transparency and fair representation, as the true impact of these decisions is often concealed. Citizens should not be forced to bear the burden of special interest demands in exchange for essential public services, such as infrastructure upgrades. Until we are presented with policies that genuinely reflect the promises made to voters, rejecting such initiatives would be the best path forward.

Ralph Nader: To Chamber Of Commerce Trumpers – Watch What You Wis...	Open Letter to President and CEO Suzanne P. Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Dear President Clark, The Chamber has come a long way without my advice. However, perhaps, you will indulge my curiosity over the majority of your members supporting Donald Trump for President. There are few conditions that the business community craves more than stability and predictability. Donald Trump is a daily chaos machine. He survives and thrives on turmoil. It is integral to his egocentric personality and supercilious character traits. It is also terribly distracting for those who focus on the business of business. It produces unproductive divisions and uproars which are bad for society and the economy. It is no secret that Mr. Trump will pursue policies of revenge against his political opponents, judges, law enforcers, and others who dared to openly defy him. Recall his July 2019 declaration, 'I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.' That has been hismodus vivendi. Whole classes of people, critical to the functioning of the economy, are on his retribution hit list. If elected, Trump, a convicted felon and the subject of multiple indictments will target immigrants, academic specialists, student activists, and a wide swath of Americans he stereotypes as 'leftists, Marxists and lunatics.' People who happen to not like Trump, his outlawry, fact deprivations, prevarications, bigotry, misogyny, and his contempt for those he calls 'suckers and losers,' including people with disabilities, are all at risk. Even retired generals, usually reluctant to enter the political fray, are now speaking out in no uncertain terms against Trump’s candidacy. Consider some specific policy positions he has stridently advanced. Trump thinks higher tariffs across the board, are paid by the foreign exporter and not passed on to consumers as higher prices. Do you know any business economists who have accepted this bizarre notion? Apart from this inflationary impact, a tariff war is believed to invite certain retaliation by foreign countries. Trump, regularly, rejects grave realities, past and present, replacing them with serious delusions. He cannot process information and brags about not reading. Trump incites violence and brings out the worst kind of hatefulness against large groups of Americans whom he paints as 'enemies within.' Many of these people merely disagree with Trump. He seriously degrades reasonable trust in the electoral process by characterizing elections he loses as being 'rigged.' Moreover, where pro-Trump governors and legislators are in office, varieties of unprecedented voter suppression and purges are rampant. Your late predecessor, Thomas J. Donohue rejected such 'conduct' as eroding 'our democratic institutions.' The Chamber may like his additional tax-cutting promises until, your economists tally up the deficits. The federal debt now takes more interest dollars to service than the Pentagon’s budget. The ever-increasing, unaudited military budget, it is never enough for Trump and causes a serious diversion from public budgets for job-producing investments in infrastructure repair and upgrading so essential for a modern corporate economy. Trump also wants to compromise the touted independence of the Federal Reserve. It is part of his web of presidential control and he is, as you know, a control freak. What is different from his first term is that, if elected, he would bring in a larger number of political appointees with extreme ideological biases and utter contempt for the civil service. Does the Chamber wish to return to the 19thcentury 'spoils system' and the corrosive corruption that it fostered? Corruption often involves overreaching business crooks who give your community a bad name and incessant negative headlines. Imagine the labor disruptions that would be caused by Trump’s determination to generate the largest deportations in American history. Over and over again he calls immigrants criminals, drug traffickers and invokes a variety of equally vile and unfounded sweeping stereotypes. His base will insist on his follow-through. This will also provoke serious ethnic tensions with costly collateral damage to critical sectors of the economy. The oil, gas, and coal companies comprise a key bloc of your membership. They applaud Trump calling climate violence a 'hoax and his 'drill baby drill' mantra. Unfortunately, mega-hurricanes, mega-floods, and mega-wildfires will have the final verdict on Trump’s destructive scrapping of a swifter transition to renewable and conservation efficiencies. You may like his constant reference to 'deregulation' or as he has recently called for 'no regulation.' Aside from studies showing the benefits of regulatory standards (see what weak regulation has done to Boeing since 2020) and protection of health and safety, what do you really have to fear from the best corporate Democrats money can buy? Besides you have a corporate judiciary bolstered by powerful corporate law firms, right up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Chamber’s members are predominantly Republican from years of allegiance to the GOP. Trump, the Republican nominee has repeatedly refused to accede to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose in November. You may wish to urgently advise your members to 'Be careful what they wish for.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO-WORjVcR0c0	2024-10-25T16:25:14-07:00	
Moscow Should Be Focusing On Lowering Mortality Rather Than Boost...	Russia’s fertility rate is approximately where Europe’s is, but its mortality rate is far higher. And because no modern country has had much success in boosting the former, Russia should be focusing on reducing the latter if it is prevent the country’s total population from continuing to decline, Russian demographers say. Unfortunately, they add, the Russian government has focused almost exclusively on boosting birthrates, something it thinks it can do, and continues to ignore reducing mortality rates by improving medical care and lifestyle choices (holod.media/2024/10/16/k-2100-godu-budet-menshe-100-millionov/). Aby Shukyurov says that in fact, Russia’s birthrate 'might be fine' given that it is an increasingly urban and modern society; but its 'mortality rate is anything but.' The former is 'comparable to Europes’s' but its mortality rate is far higher. Moreover, cardiovascular diseases rather than cancer remain the primary cause of death in contrast to Europe. Dmitry Zakotyansky points out that economic inequality is a major contributing factor to Russia’s low life expectancy, with as many as 40 percent of all Russians living in poverty, continuing to smoke and drink heavily and are more likely to be involved in or affected by crime, all of which are things the government could but isn’t addressing. Both demographers say that Russia’s demographic situation has been affected by the war in Ukraine given that according to some estimates, 120,000 Russian soldiers have died there and 400,000 more have suffered injuries which are likely to shorten their life expectancies. Again the regime could end that conflict and improve the country’s demography. Indeed, their arguments imply that all the Kremlin’s talk about boosting the birthrate is first and foremost a smokescreen to conceal its almost complete unwillingness to address mortality issues, precisely the area where state intervention could be far more effective in improving Russia’s demographic future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO5s92If7RKzr	2024-10-25T16:21:22-07:00	
Patent Monopolies And PBMs: Protectionism Leads To Corruption – O...	Last week I saw a somewhat shabbily dressed man in the pharmacy trying to get a Covid booster. They told him it would cost $130. (It was the Moderna booster.) He said that he didn’t have this money. The pharmacist and a couple of people in line then suggested a few places he may be able to get it at a lower cost, or possibly even free. The man left and was hopefully able to get an affordable shot. I was reminded of this incident when I read a New York Timespieceon pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). The gist of the piece is that PBMs often engage in sleazy practices that involve squeezing some drug stores, while overcompensating the chains with which they are affiliated. The result is higher prices and lower quality service, as many drug stores go out of business. Years ago, Ronald Reagan ran around saying that we don’t need government to fix the problem, government is the problem. In the case of the high cost of drugs and vaccines and other pharmaceutical products, Reagan is exactly on the mark. The problems that people face in getting the drugs they need at affordable prices is almost entirely due to government-granted patent monopolies and related protections. The point, which I know I make endlessly, is that drugs are almost always cheap to manufacture and distribute. In a free market it would be rare that a drug would sell for more than $30 a prescription – and often for considerably less. We would not have problems paying for our drugs and vaccines if they sold at free market prices. And there would be no such thing as PBMs in a free market. Do we have 'grocery benefit managers?' Government-granted patent monopolies create this totally avoidable problem where people have to struggle to pay for the drugs they need to protect their health and possibly their life. These can cost tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Even if they are able to get an insurer, the government, or a GoFundMe page to cover the cost, why do we want to make people struggling with serious health issues go through this effort? Public Funding: A Better Option Than Patent Monopolies The rationale for patent monopolies is that they are necessary for the industry to recoup the research costs involved in developing new drugs or vaccines. If they spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing a drug, and then generic competitors could start producing it the day it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), they would have no ability to earn back the money they had invested. If this was the situation drug companies faced, they would never invest serious money in developing new drugs since it would not be profitable. This argument is completely true, but the problem with the logic is that we have other mechanisms for financing the research needed to develop new drugs. We could have public funding. This is not a secret. We currently spend over $50 billion a year to finance biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government agencies. If we wanted to replace the patent-supported research currently conducted by the pharmaceutical industry, we would need to increase this amount by around $120 billion a year. That may seem like a lot of money, but we would likelysavemore than $500 billion a year by having all drugs and pharmaceutical products sold in a free market. If we were to increase government funding enough to replace the patent-supported research currently done by the industry, we would likely want a different mechanism. My preferred route, which I discuss inRigged(it’s free) is a system where the government signs long-term contracts (e.g. 10-15 years) with drug companies to support research in specific areas. For example, a company could contract to get $40 billion to do research for the next 12 years into developing treatments and/or cures for heart disease. Another company may contract to do research on breast cancer or lung cancer. The idea would be that the government would make the initial award and then have a largely hands off approach, other than periodic audits just to make sure that work is actually being done and the company’s executives have not just run off to Bermuda. I held up the Defense Department as a model for this sort of contracting. While there are plenty of abuses in military contracting, the fact is that we do get good weapons at the end of the day. And, we have a huge advantage with biomedical research over military procurement. There are legitimate grounds for secrecy with military research. We don’t want to put the plans for our latest weapon systems on the web where ISIS can download them. There is no basis for similar fears with biomedical research. In fact, we should want research findings shared as broadly as possible, so that researchers around the world can benefit from the latest developments (more on this in a moment). In fact, we can look to a better example for successful government contracting than straight military research. Former Biden administration economist Ernie Tedeschi pointed me to the example of SpaceX, which has made enormous progress in improving the efficiency of putting objects into space. In spite of the contempt its CEO seems to have towards the government, Musk’s accomplishments in this area were done on the government’s dime. It’s reasonable to assume that if a government agency can successfully find an innovative company like SpaceX to develop new rocket systems, a government agency can also find innovative companies to do good research in developing new drugs. The lack of secrecy should help in this process. In fact, when contracting for the development of new drugs, a condition of getting the money should be that any contractor, as well as all subcontractors (most defense contracts involve many subcontractors), post all their findings on the web as soon as practical. This will both allow for rapid dissemination, so that other researchers can quickly build on successes and learn from failures, and also limit opportunities for waste and fraud. If a company with a major contract for research in a specific area has nothing to show after six months or a year, it will be very clear to the experts in the field that something is seriously wrong. If there is not a very good story as to why the company does not seem to be making progress, or even have failures to report, then it presumably would lose its contract. This sort of openness will require some agreement for sharing the costs of research across countries. Some may view this sort of international agreement as impossible, but in fact this is exactly what the United States has been negotiating with the TRIPS provisions of the WTO and numerous other provisions on intellectual property in trade agreements over the last four decades. Working out a deal may prove contentious, but the negotiations over intellectual property issues are already contentious. There is another very important advantage to open research that is impossible to exaggerate. The patent monopoly financing system gives drug companies an enormous incentive to misrepresent the safety and effectiveness of their drugs. The markups on patent-protected drugs are typically many thousand percent over production costs. This gives drug companies a huge incentive to push their drugs as widely as possible. The opioid crisis was the most extreme example of this sort of misrepresentation, where drug companies lied about the addictiveness of the new generation of opioids, but the problemarisesconstantly. The FDA does try to police the industry, and stronger rules on the availability of clinical trial data make deception more difficult, but when a company faces such large gains from lying, it will be difficult to ensure evidence on safety and effectiveness is presented fully and accurately. In a system of open research, where contracts are renewed and expanded based on a big picture assessment of the value of its research quality, there would be little incentive or opportunity to lie in a way that could have adverse health outcomes. Companies will try to put their research in the best possible light. But at worst, any exaggerations would lead to a bad allocation of research funds, where a less effective company got funding in place of one that would be more effective. That’s unfortunate, we want to the money to go where it would be most productive, but that is of much less consequence than treating people with a drug that is ineffective or even harmful. There is one other important aspect to this mode of direct public funding as an alternative to patent-financed research. There are often nutritional or environmental factors (e.g. exposure to lead) that have major effects on health outcomes. Under the current system, the pharmaceutical industry has no incentive to examine these possibilities. They are only rewarded for developing a patentable product. Discovering that processed sugar might increase the frequency of certain types of mental illness is not going to get them any money. They therefore have no incentive to research to this sort of issue and even if their efforts to develop a patentable product might point in this direction, they would have no incentive to share that information. By contrast, if companies are being awarded contracts based on their record for producing useful research, they would have tremendous incentive to pursue leads suggesting that nutrition, exercise, or other factors have a significant impact on health in particular areas. This could lead to a far more integrated approach to public health. Getting From Here to There I have been around Washington long enough to know that we’re not about to replace the mechanism for financing drug development in one fell swoop. That would look hugely risky from both an economic standpoint – pharmaceuticals is a huge industry – and also a health standpoint. We don’t want to take a risk that many important drugs don’t get developed because we have dynamited our industry. But it is possible to envision a gradual path where we demonstrate the effectiveness of the direct funding model in two or three areas. This could mean some additional allocation of funding to NIH with the idea that it would go to directly supporting the development and testing of new drugs, which would then be available as generics from the day they are approved. For example, we could allocate $30 billion over the next decade ($3 billion a year) to support the development of new drugs to treat specific type of cancer or diabetes. This would not prevent the industry from pursuing patent-supported research in the same area. The companies would just face the risk that if they did develop a new drug that it may be competing with one that is every bit as effective and selling for less than one-tenth of the price. Of course, if the industry is confident that government-funded research will only lead to dead ends, they need not fear this risk. There actually is already a proof of concept that we can point to. Drs. Peter Hotez and Maria Elena Bottazzi, along with their colleagues at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital, developed a Covid vaccine, Corbevax. This vaccine has now been administered to more than 100 million people in India and Indonesia, protecting them against serious illness and death from Covid. Corbevax was developed on an open-source model. This means that the process for producing the vaccine, as well as the data on safety and effectiveness, is entirely open and available to anyone. That means anyone in the world with the necessary manufacturing facilities can produce the vaccine. As a result, the vaccine is cheap, selling for around $2.50 a dose in India and Indonesia. It would be desirable to have the Corbevax vaccine available in the United States. While it would likely cost somewhat more here, due to higher costs for labor and other items, we’re probably talking around $5 a shot. That compares to the $130 for the Moderna booster that my pharmacy was going to charge the shabbily dressed man. (Most people don’t see this price tag, since insurers or the government are picking up much or all of the tab for the boosters, but we do ultimately pay this cost through one pocket or another.) It would be a great first step if the FDA would approve Corbevax for distribution in the U.S. In addition to saving billions of dollars paying for boosters, and making them universally assessable, it would help to make the basic point. Drugs are cheap, government-granted patent monopolies make them expensive. Once people fully appreciate this fact, we can have more intelligent discussions of the best mechanism for financing research.

Uzbekistan: ‘We Look For Men In Beards As We Are Searching For Te...	By Mushfig Bayram From March onwards, Muslim men across Uzbekistan wearing long beards have been arrested, had their beards forcibly shaved, and fined. Muslims who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals have told Forum 18 of being arrested in and around mosques and street markets by police. Ozodlik.org (RFE/RL)Nationwide, Muslim men with long beards have been arrested during raids led by State Secret Service (SSS) secret police and ordinary police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers. The men have then been taken to police stations, had their beards forcibly shaved, and then warned that they will be fined or receive short-term jail sentences if they wear a long beard again. The fines imposed have ranged between about one month's to just over a week's average wages for those in work (see below). Some Muslim men have told Forum 18 that they have since March kept their beards 'trimmed and very thin' to avoid such punishments (see below). Regime officials have given a variety of excuses for their actions. During a March raid on a Tashkent mosque during Friday prayers, officials forced 15 male mosque attendees with beards into a room at the mosque, a Muslim who was present and wishes to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Police then claimed to the men that young people were becoming radicalised and being influenced by what were described as 'all kinds of religious movements'. Police then claimed that, therefore, all beards must be shaved off. 'If you follow their logic, a person who does not have a beard does not become radicalised,' the Muslim commented (see below). One police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' official claimed to Forum 18 that 'we sometimes look for men in beards as we are searching for terrorists. It is difficult to determine who they are at first, and sometimes they look alike. But,' he continued, 'when there is no beard or very short beard we can identify the person' (see below). When Forum 18 asked why people who the police did not identify as terrorists after an arrest still had their beards shaved, the police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' official claimed: 'I think it was because they resist the police officers' demand that they go to a police station.' He then refused to talk more, and claimed that 'we cannot discuss cases with you without the permission of the Interior Ministry.' The regime has often made allegations of alleged 'terrorism' (typically against devout Muslims) without any credible evidence (see below). Many police, Interior Ministry, SSS secret police, and court officials refused to explain to Forum 18 why Muslim men wearing long beards nationwide have from March onwards been arrested, had their beards forcibly shaved, and fined (see below). Muslims and human rights defenders, who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, have told Forum 18 that they think the regime may be planning to attack women wearing the hijab in a similar way to attacks on men wearing long beards (see below). Tashkent mosque raids In March, the State Security Service (SSS) secret police and ordinary police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers raided a Tashkent mosque during Friday prayers. Officials forced 15 male mosque attendees with beards into a room at the mosque, a Muslim who was present and wishes to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Police then claimed to the men that young people were becoming radicalised and being influenced by what were described as 'all kinds of religious movements'. The police then claimed that, therefore, all beards must be shaved off. 'If you follow their logic, a person who does not have a beard does not become radicalised,' the Muslim commented. The regime has often madeallegations of alleged 'terrorism'(typically against devout Muslims) without any credible evidence. A symptom of this attitude is the long-standing involvement of police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers in human rights violations against people of all beliefs. Some Muslim men have told Forum 18 that they have since March kept their beards 'trimmed and very thin' to avoid such punishments. In June, theSSS secret police, ordinary police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officers, and TashkentReligious Affairs Committeeofficials raided a different mosque in Tashkent Region during Friday prayers. Religious Affairs Committee official Odil Saidaliyev questioned the men who were present, one of them who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Saidaliyev then ordered all the men to shave off their beards. Tashkent Regional Police spokesperson Captain Bobur Tulyaganov refused on both 29 July and 18 October to answer Forum 18's questions about the raids. After Forum 18 asked the questions he put the phone down and did not answer further calls. Tashkent Religious Affairs Committee official Saidaliyev did not answer his phone whenever Forum 18 called on numerous occasions between 29 July and 18 October. Raids, fines, and forcible beard shavings continue nationwide Raids, fines, and forcible beard shavings have continued nationwide. When charges are brought against bearded men, they typically have been under Administrative Code Article 194, Part 1 ('Failure to carry out the lawful demands of a police officer or other persons carrying out duties to guard public order'), Administrative Code Article 183 ('Petty hooliganism'), and Administrative Code Article 184−4 ('Being in public places with the face covered to an extent that does not allow identification of a person'),introduced in September 2023. A typical example was a series of raids between 22 May and 29 May by Jizzakh Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'on Jizzakh's Kuk bozor open air market. Muslim men wearing beards were arrested, ordered to shave off beards, prosecuted and fined. The fines imposed ranged between 1,700,000 Soms (about two weeks' average wages for those in formal work) and 680,000 Soms (just over a week's average wages for those in work). A Jizzakh Regional Police officer, who refused to give his name, told Forum 18 on 21 October that the raids and fines happened, but refused to explain why Muslim men are not allowed to grow long beards. Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officer Rahmiddin Pardayev, who took part in the raids, refused on 21 October to explain why Muslim men were ordered to shave off their beards and fined. He went on to claim that 'we cannot do anything without the Interior Ministry in Tashkent agreeing, including talking to you.' 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' Deputy Head Ilhom Hajamkulov put the phone down each time Forum 18 called him and introduced itself. Judge Janibek Tangmatov of Jizzakh Court imposed some of the fines, and Court Chancellery officials who refused to give their names refused on 21 October to explain to Forum 18 why the Court fined Muslim men for wearing beards. Judge Tangmatov's assistant, Sardor Saadullayev, asked Forum 18 on 21 October to call back the following day as 'the Judge is busy'. When Forum 18 called back on 22 October, Saadullayev refused to put Forum 18 through to Judge Tangmatov and also refused to explain why Muslim men were fined for wearing beards. Andijan Region raids Similar raids on bazaars and streets also took place in Andijan Region. For example, on 10 May Asaka District Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officers stopped in the street a Muslim man for wearing a long beard. Asaka District Court then fined him 3,400,000 Soms (just over one month's average wages for those in work). On 13 June, Andijan Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'raided Andijan's Jahon bazaar, an open air market. Timurshah Odilov, a local Muslim man with a beard, refused to go a police station to have his beard shaved off as he had a child with him. However, he told officers that he would shave off his beard at home. One of the 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers then grabbed Odilov by the collar while another officer twisted his arm. They then took him to a police station to have his beard shaved off. He was then prosecuted for wearing a beard. Judge Mukhayyakhon Turdiyeva of Andijan City Court fined Odilov 1,020,000 Soms (about one and a half weeks' average wages for those in formal work) under:- Administrative Code Article 184−4 ('Covering one's face in public places to the extent that it hinders identification');- Administrative Code Article 183 ('Petty hooliganism');-Administrative Code Article 184-3('Production, storage or distribution of works promoting national, ethnic, racial, or religious hatred');- and Administrative Code Article 194, Part 1 ('Failure to carry out the lawful demands of a police officer or other persons carrying out duties to guard public order'). Officer Murad Kasimov of Andijan Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'on 21 October at first denied to Forum 18 that raids took place, or that Muslim men were stopped, had beards shaved off, and were fined. 'I do not know where you take your facts but we do not raid looking for bearded men,' he claimed. When Forum 18 referred to cases it knew of, Officer Kasimov admitted that 'maybe minor incidents took place, but there were no raids'. He refused to explain why Muslim men wearing beards were targeted. He asked Forum 18 to on 22 October call the head of Andijan Regional Police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department,' Kasim Maripov. When Forum 18 repeatedly called Maripov on 22 October, the duty officer put the phone down as soon as he heard Forum 18's name. Andijan Regional Court officials on 21 and 22 October refused to explain to Forum 18 why courts fined Muslim men for wearing long beards. One official, Jovokhir Jubakov, Head of the Court's Chancellery, put the phone down on 21 October after Forum 18 asked questions about the fines. 'We sometimes look for men in beards as we are searching for terrorists' In August in Namangan Region, police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officers stopped a Muslim man with a beard, who was then given a five-day short-term jail sentence under Administrative Code Article 183 ('Petty hooliganism'). Akramjon Omonov, Deputy Head of Namangan Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department', on 21 October denied that Muslim men are punished for wearing long beards. His subordinate Mansur Valiyev claimed that 'we sometimes look for men in beards as we are searching for terrorists. It is difficult to determine who they are at first, and sometimes they look alike. But,' Valiyev continued, 'when there is no beard or very short beard we can identify the person.' When Forum 18 asked why people who the police did not identify as terrorists after an arrest still had their beards shaved, Valiyev claimed: 'I think it was because they resist the police officers' demand that they go to a police station.' He then refused to talk more, and claimed that 'we cannot discuss cases with you without the permission of the Interior Ministry'. Avazjon Khasanov, Deputy Head of the Interior Ministry's'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department', would not explain to Forum 18 on 18 October why Muslim men were being punished nationwide for wearing beards. 'I am not responsible for religious issues any longer, please talk to someone else,' he claimed – even though Khasanov's colleagues stated he was still responsible for freedom of religion or belief cases. When Forum 18 called Khasanov again, he claimed that it was 'a wrong number'. AnSSS secret policeofficer at their Tashkent headquarters on 18 October refused to talk about the raids and punishments for beards. He refused to give his name and claimed that 'I am responsible for the Education Department'. He refused to put Forum 18 through to any other responsible SSS officials. Officials of theReligious Affairs Committee, which is responsible along with other regime agencies for suppressing freedom of religion or belief, did not answer their phones on 21 or 22 October. Regime plans attacks on women wearing hijab also? Muslims and human rights defenders, who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, have told Forum 18 that they think the regime may be planning to attack women wearing the hijab in a similar way to attacks on men wearing long beards. They note that regime-controlled TV channels have since September been claiming that women who were the hijab are doing something 'foreign to Uzbek culture and tradition'. Some regime officials have also suggested that 'officials and university and school teachers must carry out explanatory work among women not to wear the hijab', one human rights defender told Forum 18. People the regime rules had wanted to see the 2021 Religion Law end a de facto hijab ban among other changes, but the regimepaid little to no attentionto any suggestions made during its 'consultations' before it adopted the Law. The regime hasin 2022,in 2021, and earlier targeted women wearing the hijab in a variety of ways. This includes adding devout Muslim women to thePreventative Register, which results in a wide range of alleged 'preventative measures'. From August 2018, a government decisionimposed a secular dress code in all educational institutions. This meant a de facto ban on female students covering their heads by wearing a hijab. In 2021, officialswarned parents across Uzbekistan of unspecified consequencesif they teach Islam to their children, or if any of their children wear the hijab. The regime is also in 2024adopting a draft lawto allegedly 'further strengthen the rights of children'. The Law would ban and introduce punishments for parents or guardians who allow their children to receive 'illegal' religious education before the age of 18. The Senate – the upper chamber of the non-freely elected parliament – approved the draft law on 16 August, according to its website. Existing laws target those who teach religion to under-18s, not the parents or guardians targeted by the draft Law. Many of the people the regime rules have expressed strong opposition to the draft Law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO3BLrZUSNRzZ	2024-10-25T16:14:55-07:00	
India’s Strategic Gains At BRICS 2024: Navigating Multipolarity A...	The BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, held in 2024, marked a significant milestone in the evolution of the group, with India emerging as a pivotal player. India’s strategic diplomacy at this summit was a testament to its growing influence in the shifting global order, where emerging economies are vying for a more prominent role in global governance. India deftly balanced its national interests while promoting multilateralism, a feat that underscored its vision of an inclusive and multipolar world. Strategic Positioning in a Changing World Order India has long advocated for a multipolar world, emphasizing the need for reforms in global governance institutions to reflect the realities of the 21st century. At the Kazan summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated the call for reforms in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The idea is not just to seek greater representation for India and other BRICS members, but to create a more equitable system that better addresses the needs of emerging and developing economies. India’s advocacy for global governance reforms also reflects its strategic aspirations. As one of the world’s largest economies, India has increasingly demanded a voice in institutions that shape international financial policies, climate action, and peacekeeping missions. Reforming the UNSC, where India has long sought a permanent seat, remains a key objective. With the support of BRICS members, particularly Russia and South Africa, India has positioned itself as a leader in pushing for these critical changes. India's Exclusion from the UNSC: A Persistent Challenge One critical issue that has continually frustrated India is its exclusion from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as a permanent member. Despite being the world’s largest democracy and home to nearly 18% of the global population, India remains absent from the elite decision-making circle of global governance. This exclusion is not only unjustifiable based on India's demographic and economic contributions but also undermines the legitimacy of the UNSC, which continues to reflect the post-World War II balance of power. India’s consistent push for UNSC reforms has not yielded significant results, primarily due to resistance from the current permanent members (P5), particularly China. This continuous marginalization has led India to explore alternative forums like BRICS, which serve as platforms for influencing global policy and reforming the current order. The Kazan summit reiterated India’s stance that emerging powers like itself deserve a more prominent role in international decision-making bodies. For India, BRICS represents more than just a coalition of emerging economies; it is a ray of hope for India and other developing and underrepresented countries. BRICS offers an alternative to Western-dominated institutions like the UNSC, where India’s aspirations have long been sidelined. By championing BRICS as a platform for the Global South, India is positioning itself as a leader advocating for the interests of smaller nations, particularly those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which also suffer from exclusion in global governance. BRICS Expansion and Economic Diplomacy: New Pathways for Cooperation The expansion of BRICS, including six new members Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE was a watershed moment in the bloc’s history. India supported the expansion, seeing it as an opportunity to broaden the group’s economic and geopolitical influence, especially in regions like Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, where India has growing interests. Energy Security and Strategic Partnerships: India’s energy security concerns were central to its diplomatic engagement at the summit. With the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the UAE, BRICS now boasts some of the world’s largest oil and gas producers. This presents India with an opportunity to negotiate better energy deals, ensuring long-term access to affordable energy supplies. Saudi Arabia’s entry, in particular, offers India a chance to deepen its strategic ties with the Gulf nation, which is already a crucial partner in energy and investment. Iran's inclusion is also significant, as it opens doors for greater cooperation on the Chabahar Port project. Chabahar is a critical element in India’s regional strategy, providing access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Strengthening ties with Iran through BRICS could accelerate connectivity projects and trade routes, enhancing India’s presence in Central Asia a region increasingly under Chinese and Russian influence. Expanding Influence in Africa: The addition of Egypt and Ethiopia strengthens India’s foothold in Africa, a continent that has become a focus of global competition. India has been actively engaging with African nations through platforms like the India-Africa Forum Summit, focusing on sectors such as technology, healthcare, and education. Africa’s growing strategic importance, especially in terms of natural resources and market potential, aligns with India’s long-term goals of expanding its trade and investment footprint in the region. Moreover, Egypt’s membership offers India a gateway to North Africa and enhances cooperation in areas like counterterrorism, defense, and infrastructure development. Ethiopia’s inclusion, as the seat of the African Union and a major player in East African geopolitics, further consolidates India’s diplomatic reach in the continent. China-India Relations: Diplomacy Amidst Strategic Competition At the Kazan summit, one of India’s significant diplomatic achievements was the apparent thaw in relations with China. Despite the lingering tensions over the 2020 border clashes, the summit provided an opportunity for dialogue, with Russia playing a mediating role. India recognizes that stability with China is critical, both for regional security and for ensuring the success of broader BRICS initiatives. India’s approach to China within BRICS, however, remains cautious. While it values the economic and trade opportunities within the bloc, it is wary of China’s growing assertiveness, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Through initiatives like the Quad, India continues to build strategic alliances aimed at counterbalancing Chinese influence. Nevertheless, the two nations’ shared interests in BRICS, especially in areas like trade, infrastructure development, and multilateralism, provide a platform for cautious cooperation. Economic Engagement and Trade Partnerships India’s growing economy and its emphasis on technological innovation were central to its contributions at the BRICS summit. India’s tech-driven development agenda aligns well with the group’s goals of increasing intra-BRICS trade and investment. Prime Minister Modi’s call for closer cooperation in areas such as digital infrastructure, green energy, and financial technology was well received, positioning India as a leader in these fields within the bloc. India’s booming tech sector, which has seen rapid growth in areas such as artificial intelligence, fintech, and digital payments, stands to benefit from greater collaboration with BRICS partners. India’s leadership in Unified Payments Interface (UPI) systems and its pioneering role in digital public goods were highlighted at the summit, offering a model for other BRICS nations to emulate. Expanding such cooperation could boost India's trade, especially in digital services, across BRICS economies. The BRICS Currency: A Game-Changer for Global Trade One of the most discussed proposals at the summit was the idea of a BRICS currency to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. For India, this proposal carries significant economic and geopolitical implications: Mitigating Dollar Dependency: India, like other BRICS nations, has long been exposed to the vagaries of U.S. monetary policy, particularly the fluctuations of the dollar. A BRICS currency could offer an alternative for settling trade transactions, thereby reducing the volatility that comes with dollar-based trade. This could be particularly beneficial for India’s oil imports from BRICS nations like Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Geopolitical Leverage: A BRICS currency would also provide India with a tool to bypass Western sanctions on countries like Russia and Iran, ensuring that trade and energy cooperation can continue without being affected by external pressures. Such a development could shield India from economic disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions, allowing it to maintain a steady flow of crucial imports and exports. Strengthening the Rupee’s International Role: India has been pushing for greater internationalization of the rupee, and the introduction of a BRICS currency could complement these efforts. By creating a more diversified global currency landscape, India can position the rupee as a stable currency for trade, especially within the developing world. Counterterrorism Cooperation and Regional Security Counterterrorism has been a priority for India in its BRICS engagements, and the Kazan summit was no exception. India called for enhanced intelligence-sharing and cooperation to combat terrorism, which remains a critical security concern in South Asia. The inclusion of new members from the Middle East and Africa also provides India with new avenues to collaborate on counterterrorism efforts, especially given the cross-border terrorism threats it faces from Pakistan. India’s push for stronger multilateral frameworks within BRICS to tackle terrorism underscores its broader security objectives. BRICS offers a platform for India to address not only regional security issues but also to influence global counterterrorism norms and practices. Conclusion The BRICS 2024 Kazan Summit marked a defining moment for India’s global diplomacy. By advocating for expansion, promoting reforms in global governance, and supporting initiatives like the BRICS currency, India has reinforced its role as a key architect of a more inclusive and multipolar world order. Its diplomatic balancing act navigating complex relationships with China and Russia while maintaining strong ties with the West showcases India’s pragmatic and forward-looking foreign policy. As BRICS continues to evolve, India’s leadership in shaping the group’s direction, especially in areas like economic cooperation, and energy security.

Indonesia’s Interest In Joining BRICS: Pursuing Economic Security...	BRICS, a coalition comprising five major emerging economies—Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa—collectively accounts for approximately 35% of global GDP, serving as a counterbalance to Western dominance within international economic institutions. Indonesia’s aspiration to join BRICS, as articulated by the newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs Sugiono, reflects its desire for enhanced influence in an increasingly multipolar world, while simultaneously addressing domestic objectives concerning food and energy security. This strategic initiative aligns with President Prabowo Subianto’s broader foreign policy vision, which emphasizes maintaining independence from major global blocs and advocating for the interests of the Global South. Indonesia’s interest in BRICS membership encompasses the potential for economic diversification, an augmented geopolitical position, and enhanced regional leadership; however, it also potentially encounters resistance from Western allies, particularly the United States and the European Union. This essay will analyze Indonesia’s motivations for seeking BRICS membership, the anticipated challenges stemming from Western opposition, the country’s internal readiness for such membership, and the strategies Indonesia might adopt to surmount these obstacles. Indonesia’s Strategic Benefits of Joining BRICS The decision to pursue BRICS membership is motivated by several strategic considerations. First, BRICS provides a vital platform for Indonesia to bolster its food and energy security—two pressing concerns that have been exacerbated by disruptions in global supply chains and fluctuations in commodity prices. Given that BRICS cooperation encourages sustainable development, membership would afford Indonesia access to the resources and policy frameworks necessary to safeguard these sectors against future crises. Furthermore, BRICS membership has the potential to significantly enhance investment and trade opportunities by broadening Indonesia’s economic partnerships beyond traditional Western markets. This diversification is critical for mitigating Indonesia’s economic vulnerability to fluctuations in Western markets and sanctions, while simultaneously strengthening its bargaining position on the global stage. Trade with BRICS nations, particularly China and India, could serve as a stable economic buffer, propelling growth in sectors such as manufacturing, energy, and technology. Geopolitically, Indonesia could utilize BRICS as a forum to advocate for the interests of the Global South, thereby amplifying its influence on pressing global issues, including climate change, trade equity, and technology transfer. As a leader among emerging developing nations, Indonesia could leverage BRICS to promote policies that are advantageous to less-developed countries, thereby enhancing its diplomatic stature while simultaneously addressing systemic inequities within international governance structures. Steps for Indonesia to Achieve BRICS Membership Indonesia’s path to membership in BRICS will necessitate a meticulously structured process and the backing of current BRICS members. Initially, Indonesia must submit a formal application accompanied by a comprehensive proposal that evidences its economic compatibility and shared political objectives with BRICS. It is imperative to demonstrate its status as a significant emerging market with a diversified industrial base to persuade existing members of Indonesia’s value to the coalition. To obtain support from current BRICS nations, Indonesia will be required to engage in diplomatic outreach and establish bilateral agreements. Strengthening economic and strategic ties with China and India, prominent members of BRICS would affirm Indonesia’s commitment to the bloc’s core objectives. These partnerships may encompass increased trade agreements, joint development projects, and collaborative research initiatives focused on technology and energy security. Furthermore, Indonesia must address its economic and structural readiness by implementing necessary reforms to meet BRICS standards. This involves enhancing domestic infrastructure, ensuring political stability, and aligning with BRICS Development Bank policies to showcase Indonesia’s capacity to contribute to the goals of BRICS. By adopting regulatory frameworks that align with BRICS’ positions on trade liberalization and financial transparency, Indonesia can enhance its attractiveness as a candidate. Challenges and Negative Reactions from the West Indonesia’s potential membership in BRICS is likely to elicit mixed reactions, particularly from the United States and the European Union. Politically, Western allies may perceive Indonesia’s BRICS membership as a deviation from its longstanding commitment to an independent and active foreign policy, fearing greater Indonesian alignment with China and Russia, two nations that frequently challenge Western hegemony. This shift could strain Indonesia’s defence agreements and security partnerships with the US and EU, potentially leading to a decline in defence support and critical cooperative engagements necessary for maintaining regional stability in Southeast Asia. Economic repercussions are also likely, as the US and EU may impose economic disincentives by gradually scaling back trade preferences to signal their disapproval. Such measures could include revoking favourable trade statuses, implementing tariffs, or restricting foreign direct investment in strategic sectors, especially in areas of direct conflict between BRICS and Western interests. Indonesia may also face limitations in accessing Western-backed developmental or financial aid support programs, as these countries might reallocate resources to nations deemed stronger allies. Internally, Indonesia faces challenges in aligning its economic and structural frameworks with BRICS, as it currently exhibits significant dependence on Western markets. Shifting this dependency necessitates the implementation of a long-term economic strategy that emphasizes industrial diversification, expansion, and investment in technological capabilities. Furthermore, Indonesia must enhance its financial and regulatory institutions to align with BRICS policies, including banking standards and anti-corruption frameworks, to effectively engage in multilateral financial arrangements with BRICS nations. Strategic Solutions for Indonesia To balance its diplomatic relationships while pursuing BRICS membership, Indonesia should reinforce its non-aligned foreign policy stance, clarifying that BRICS membership is intended as an extension of its strategy to diversify partnerships rather than a departure from its Western alliances. Clear communication and public diplomacy may mitigate concerns among Western nations, assuring the U.S. and EU of Indonesia's commitment to regional stability and balanced international relations. Economic reforms will be essential to prepare Indonesia for BRICS membership. The implementation of a gradual economic transition plan focused on diversifying exports and supporting domestic industries can reduce reliance on Western markets while enhancing resilience against economic shocks. Additionally, public-private partnerships within Indonesia can attract investments from BRICS and other non-Western countries, providing an economic buffer should support from the U.S. or EU diminish. Internally, strengthening institutions will be crucial for ensuring Indonesia’s long-term resilience within BRICS. Investment in robust financial institutions, the adoption of regulatory best practices, and the promotion of transparency are necessary for effective engagement within the coalition. Capacity-building initiatives across Indonesian industries will also ensure that the workforce and local businesses are prepared to adapt to shifts in trade dynamics and regional economic trends. Conclusion and Recommendations In conclusion, while Indonesia’s pursuit of BRICS membership represents a strategic initiative to enhance its economic and geopolitical influence, it must address both external and internal challenges to fully capitalize on the potential benefits. Indonesia should maintain a balanced approach, carefully navigating relationships with the U.S. and EU while strengthening cooperation with BRICS. A focus on economic reforms, institutional strengthening, and adherence to an independent foreign policy will enable Indonesia to join BRICS without compromising its long-standing alliances or regional stability. Ultimately, Indonesia’s path to BRICS reflects its vision of fostering a more multipolar world wherein emerging economies wield greater influence, potentially reshaping the global order to better represent the diverse interests of the Global South.

Poverty Is Rising And Inequality Widening In Asia And The Pacific...	The Asia-Pacific region, with over 4.8 billion people spread across 58 countries and territories, is home to about 60 percent of the world’s total population of 8.2 billion. The population of Asia, which include India and China, is expected to continue to grow, reaching 5.3 billion by 2050. However, it is projected to fall in the second half of the century. A new UN report released October 21 predicts that more than 260 million people in the Asia-Pacific region could be pushed into poverty in the next decade unless governments step up with robust social protection schemes. The findings inProtecting our Future Today: Social Protection in Asia and the Pacific reportreveal that poverty, both in monetary and non-monetary forms, is rising while inequalities in income and wealth are widening across the region. The number of people in vulnerable situations in the region is expected to rise, as negative shocks continue to hit amid prevailing inequalities. And access to basic opportunities and services also remains too often a distant goal for many. Most concerning, 45 per cent of people in the region have no social protection coverage at all. Millions of people living just above the national poverty line are vulnerable to shocks. Without stronger social protection systems, 266 million people could be pushed into poverty in 2040 under a worst-case scenario. The report was released at the eighth session of theCommittee on Social Development, which brought together senior government officials, top experts and key stakeholders to explore building inclusive and comprehensive social protection systems that are future proof in view of key megatrends including demographic trends, climate change and digitalization. United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, said megatrends bring both challenges and opportunities. 'However, we need policy action to maximize the benefits of these megatrends while minimizing their costs,' she said. 'When done right, social protection and inclusive policies with a gender—and disability lens can enhance people’s resilience, facilitate adaptation and reduce the negative impacts of climate change. Acting today rather than tomorrow is not only more cost-effective but also crucial for intergenerational solidarity and ensuring that no one is left behind.' In his keynote address, Jomo Kwame Sundaram, Senior Adviser, Khazanah Research Institute, said: 'A whole of government and a whole of society approach is needed at the national level to resolve the socio-economic and environmental challenges countries of our region are facing especially given the limited resources available for social spending.' The ESCAP report provides a blueprint on how governments can improve social protection systems across the region. Leveraging strategic foresight methodology, the report offers policy recommendations to meet changing conditions and argues that the price of inaction today far exceeds the cost of requisite action. 'Recent years have shown us how fragile our progress has been in the region. We have heard how poverty is on the rise for the first time in decades. Unless we build the resilience of our people and planet, we cannot achieve sustained peace and prosperity in the region,' said H Maliki Achmad, Deputy Minister of National Development Planning of Indonesia, who was also elected as Chair of the Committee. 'The recent pledges in the ‘Pact for the Future’made by our fellow nations, underscore our collective resolve, urgency and responsibility to shape a brighter tomorrow for future generations. This is a critical moment for reflection and action. It is time for us, as a region, to assess our progress and determine how we can come together to create a better future,'said Anukul Peedkaew, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Social Development and Human Security of Thailand. The Committee will also review social and economic challenges and opportunities associated with slower population growth and related changes in population age structures, as well as strengthening disability-inclusive development	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO2R71TIEldhh	2024-10-25T15:55:42-07:00	
Redefining Justice: The Impact Of Pakistan’s 26th Constitutional ...	Pakistan's recently passed 26th Constitutional Amendment, also known as the 'Constitutional Package,' represents one of the most comprehensive reforms in the country's judicial history. This set of amendments aims to address transparency, accountability, and the balance of power within the judiciary. By curtailing certain judicial powers and involving Parliament in judicial appointments, this amendment package seeks to enhance democratic oversight and address longstanding criticisms about judicial overreach. However, the amendment has also sparked debate, as it introduces significant shifts in judicial functioning, particularly with regard to the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers and the appointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP). One of the amendment's most impactful provisions is the restructuring of the Chief Justice's appointment process. Previously, the most senior judge of the Supreme Court automatically succeeded as CJP, an arrangement designed to ensure neutrality and clear succession. However, the 26th Amendment introduces a new approach: a Special Parliamentary Committee will now recommend the CJP from among the top three senior judges, allowing Parliament to influence this critical role. The committee, composed of eight National Assembly members and four Senate members, is structured to reflect the proportional representation of parliamentary parties, giving the selection process a more democratic veneer. Supporters of this change argue that it ensures the appointment of a leader who is not chosen solely based on seniority but also possesses experience and qualifications that align with the judiciary's current needs. This provision echoes a broader trend seen in other countries where judicial leadership appointments consider qualities beyond tenure. However, critics warn that this change could open the door to political influence over the judiciary’s highest office, potentially undermining its independence. Another pivotal change under the amendment is the Supreme Court’s restricted use of suo motu powers. Previously, the apex court could initiate cases of public interest independently, a power that has been instrumental in addressing pressing issues without the need for formal applications. Under the new law, however, the Supreme Court may only exercise jurisdiction based on specific applications filed before it. This restriction is significant, as it limits the judiciary's ability to address urgent social issues spontaneously. Proponents of this measure argue that it prevents judicial overreach and respects the separation of powers by ensuring that courts do not unilaterally interfere with legislative or executive functions. Critics, however, worry that this change could hinder the court’s ability to address issues that may not be championed by the other branches of government. The amendment also introduces a term limit for the Chief Justice of Pakistan, setting it at three years or until the judge reaches the age of 65, whichever is sooner. This term cap is intended to ensure that the judiciary’s leadership remains dynamic, with frequent changes allowing for fresh perspectives. However, this raises questions about continuity, as the CJP may no longer serve long enough to see through extensive reforms. Furthermore, the 26th Amendment establishes constitutional benches within the Supreme Court, creating a specialized structure that aims to handle constitutional and politically significant cases. By forming these benches, the amendment seeks to reduce the overall backlog of cases and ensure that cases affecting ordinary citizens are resolved more quickly. High-profile cases that could stall other judicial processes are now assigned to designated constitutional benches, allowing the regular judiciary to function more efficiently. Another notable feature is the emphasis on judicial accountability. The amendment requires performance evaluations of high court judges, with unsatisfactory judges given a grace period to improve. If they fail to meet these standards, their cases can be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council, reinforcing accountability within the judiciary. Alongside judicial reforms, the amendment enshrines environmental rights as a constitutional priority. With Article 9A, Pakistan has become one of the few countries to constitutionally guarantee its citizens the right to a clean and healthy environment. This development highlights the state’s commitment to addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change makes this clause particularly relevant, setting a precedent for judicial enforcement of environmental protection. While supporters of the 26th Amendment view it as a positive step towards a more transparent and accountable judiciary, opponents remain concerned about executive overreach. The involvement of Parliament in judicial appointments raises questions about potential political interference, especially when it comes to selecting high-level judicial leaders. Balancing accountability with judicial independence will be key to the amendment's success. In redefining the roles and functions within Pakistan's judiciary, the 26th Amendment reflects a changing landscape. Its emphasis on oversight, accountability, and environmental protection signals the government’s effort to create a more modern and responsive judiciary. However, navigating the fine line between reform and overreach will be crucial to achieving its intended goals.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO_3axTY5jW56	2024-10-25T15:52:08-07:00	
Is China Peeved – Or Pleased – By North Korean Troops In Ukraine?...	By Paul Eckert China remains officially agnostic about North Korea’s deployment of troops to help Russia’s war in Ukraine – a dispatch that analysts say holds potential trouble for Pyongyang’s main backer Beijing even as both communist nations share the goal of supporting Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian repeated the line Beijing has used in the face ofincreasingly definitive and detailed accountsof the dispatch to, and movements within, Russia of Korean People’s Army forces from the North. 'China does not have information on that and our position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We always believe that all parties need to promote the deescalation of the situation and strive for a political settlement,' Lin said at Friday’s daily newsbriefingin Beijing. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate said, adding that the first sightings of North Korean soldiers were recorded on Tuesday. Reports say troops are disguised as ethnic minorities from Siberia. South Korea last weekreleased detailed satellite imagesit said showed the first deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. The United States also said on Wednesday it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine. China is usually secretive about foreign policy issues, and especially about ties with North Korea, but there are real concerns in Beijing behind this silence, analysts say. 'Beijing is clearly uncomfortable with the news that North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia to assist Moscow’s war in Ukraine for a number of reasons,' said Patricia Kim, a fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington. Adding to regional troubles For one, Beijing sees a tightening Russia-North Korea alignment as reducing its own influence with those states, and worries that any military assistance Pyongyang gets from Moscow in return for deploying troops might make it more aggressive in Northeast Asia, she told Radio Free Asia Korean. 'China has no interest in the rise of a militarily strengthened and emboldened North Korea that might take greater risks and bring chaos to the region,' Kim said. Also, a bolder Pyongyang would add to the troubles stoked by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, which has been a main source of regional tension for decades. Even before the Ukraine troop deployment, North Korean nuclear saber-rattling and other acts of aggression had been drawing the United States, Japan and South Korea ever closer together in an alliance Beijing has viewed as an Asian NATO aimed at constraining Chinese power. Reports of North Korean troops poised to fight in Ukraine 'continue to confirm the growing connection between transatlantic and Indo-Pacific security,' Sen. Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement Friday. North Korea is China’s only treaty ally, posing the risk of deeper entanglement in the Ukraine conflict, further undercutting Beijing’s already strained attempts to portray itself as a neutral party and a force for peace. 'While China has taken a neutral stance on the surface regarding the war, it is clearly sympathetic to Russia,' said Naoko Aoki of the Rand Corporation think tank. 'But China does not want instability in its own region, which could be heightened as a result of North Korea’s troop deployment.' For its part, 'North Korea has been complaining quite a bit about the Japan-South Korea-United States cooperation, and how that impacts not only North Korea but also Russia and China,' she told RFA Mandarin. Chinese leverage? Aoki says the Ukraine deployment of North Korean troops means Beijing will again face calls to use its leverage on Pyongyang. 'We don’t know how President Xi and the Chinese are looking at this,' said John Kirby, spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council in Washington. 'One would think that if you take their comments at face value about desiring stability and security in the region, particularly on the Korean Peninsula, one would think that they’re also deeply concerned by this development,' he said at the White House on Wednesday. If Beijing moves beyond the current denial phase and becomes worried about North Korean troops fighting in Ukraine, its role as the main economic and diplomatic benefactor of Kim Jong Un’s regime in Pyongyang gives it many tools. 'North Korea still clearly needs China for economic support, which Russia is not in a position to give,' said Aoki. 'If the past is any guide, China’s pressure on North Korea, if it takes place, is likely to be applied quietly and will be difficult to observe from the outside,' she added. The Financial TimesreportedFriday that China has been signaling its unease with closer North Korea-Russia ties, sending senior official Zhao Leji to Pyongyang in April. In June, Kim and Putin agreed to a strategic partnership with a mutual assistance clause. In a letter last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping thanked Kim for a congratulatory message on the 75th anniversary of Communist China’s founding — but dropped the customary reference to North Korea as a 'friendly neighboring country,' the Times reported. Keeping Xi’s hands clean One school of thought, however, holds that Beijing will be happy to sit back and watch North Korea take steps that China supports but is not willing to do on its own. 'In many ways, China benefits from North Korean support for Russia as it reduces the pressure on Beijing to support Moscow with direct military aid while also straining the military capacities of the United States,' said Troy Stangerone of the Wilson Center in Washington. David Maxwell, vice president at the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said China'may be quietly pleased' as North Korea offers a 'convenient cut out' to send lethal aid and now troops to help Putin. 'Xi likely does not want Putin to fail, but he does not want to get his hands dirty by providing lethal aid from China to Russia,' he told RFA Korean. 'Xi can keep his hands clean while KPA troops fight and die for Putin.'

Israel Is Trying To ‘Weaken’ Hezbollah As A Political And Economi...	By Kian Sharifi (RFE/RL) -- Israel's weekslong aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon has targeted the leadership and military capabilities of Hezbollah. Now, Israel has expanded its targets and hit civilian infrastructure, including banks, affiliated with Hezbollah, an armed group and political party that controls much of southern Lebanon. Experts say Israel's aim is to erode Hezbollah not just as a military power but also a political and economic force in Lebanon. Hezbollah is a U.S.-designated a terrorist organization, although the EU has only blacklisted its military wing. 'Beyond the degradation of the military capabilities, personnel, and armaments, there is certainly an Israeli attempt to weaken Hezbollah politically, socially, and financially,' says Eran Etzion, a former Israeli diplomat and ex-deputy head of Israel's National Security Council. On October 21, Israeli air strikes targeted the branches of the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), which is affiliated with Hezbollah. The bank offers financial services to civilians in areas where Hezbollah has strong support. But Israel and the United States accuse it of serving as a front for the group to fund its military activities. Israel's targeting of the AQAH branches 'marks an expansion in terms of the types of targets that Israel is hitting,' says Etzion. But it does not mean Israel is attempting to completely dismantle Hezbollah, he adds. Experts say destroying Hezbollah is not Israel's objective, not least because that is an unrealistic goal. Instead, they said, Israel is trying to degrade its military capabilities and political base. 'Hezbollah is the predominant political power in Lebanon, and if it is militarily significantly weakened, that would also reduce its political power,' says Joost Hiltermann, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Belgium-based International Crisis Group. Under Lebanon's sectarian political system, the president is a Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament is a Shi'ite Muslim. Hezbollah, whose power base is among Shi'a, has representatives at the ministerial and parliamentary levels. Its alliance with non-Shi'ite parties also gives it further political clout. Hiltermann questioned whether Israel had the ability to effect political change in Lebanon. Iran-backed Hezbollah is more powerful than even the Lebanese Army, and smaller political factions in Lebanon do not have the military force or political clout to push it out completely, he said. After invading Lebanon in 1982, Israel attempted and failed to reshape Lebanon's political scene by bringing a pro-Israeli Christian party to power. 'There is a recognition that Israel's abilities in that particular sphere are limited,' says Etzion. For Netanyahu, It's Personal Observers say Israel's civilian and military leaders are split over how to approach the ongoing conflict with Hezbollah. One camp wants to wind down the war and secure a political settlement based on UN Security Council Resolution 1701. That would include Hezbollah fighters retreating from near the Israeli border and UN peacekeeping forces ensuring security along the border. The other camp, which includes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is looking to expand the conflict into a 'full-fledged regional war' involving both Iran and the United States, Etzion says. Israel has vowed to strike Iran in retaliation for Tehran's massivemissile attackon October 1. Manyworrythat an Israeli attack will result in an escalating cycle of tit-for-tat strikes that will spiral into a warengulfingthe entire region. Netanyahu's primary goal 'is to sustain his grip on power and to make sure he's not ousted,' Etzion says. 'He has a clear political, personal, and criminal interest in perpetuating the war.' Netanyahu's critics blame him for the security lapses that resulted in the October 7 attack by U.S.- and EU-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Netanyahu is also facing serious corruption charges, and his detractors say the prime minister is trying to indefinitely postpone his own trial.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCOyiSojihFiHN	2024-10-25T15:45:13-07:00	
Will Specter Of War In Ukraine Overshadow Xi And Putin’s Push For...	By Katherine Michaelson The 2024 BRICS summit in Russia this week provided Moscow and Beijing with a showcase for their shared anti-West sentiment and global ambitions, but analysts say the war in Ukraine may be fracturing the 'no limits' relationship between the two countries. The location of the summit was strategically significant, given international efforts to isolate Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. 'For Russia as the host, the most important thing is to highlight that it is not isolated and still has supporters on the international stage.' said Shiau-shyang Liou, associate research fellow at the Taiwan-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. 'China is actually facing a similar predicament — it is being sanctioned by the United States, though it has not yet reached the point of military conflict. Therefore, on these issues, they share common interests and align in their direction,' Liou added. Readouts of the summit reflected the shared ambitions of China and Russia within BRICS, a grouping of 10 countries that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa but now is expanding. New members include Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Ethiopia. At the summit, Beijing and Moscow both articulated plans for economic systems separate from Western-led institutions; praised the success of BRICS countries in various development initiatives; and advanced plans to lead the network of states toward a more interconnected future. In his speech at the BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin promoted the creation of various mechanisms that would bypass traditional, Western-led systems that make his country vulnerable to Western economic sanctions. 'We believe that launching a special mechanism for consultations between BRICS countries on issues related to the World Trade Organisation will help us chart a common position on formulating more equitable rules of the game in the global economy and overhauling the international financial system,' according to atranscript of his speechreleased by the Kremlin. Chinese leader Xi Jinping echoed Putin’s remarks, saying the BRICS countries 'should play a leading role in the reform.' 'We must ensure that the international financial system more effectively reflects the changes in the global economic landscape,' Xi said. He also said BRICS member countries need to jointly work toward building BRICS 'into a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations and a vanguard for advancing global governance reform.' China’s and Russia’s ability to deliver meaningful results on the commitments they have made is likely to face challenges, said Ali Wyne, senior researcher at the International Crisis Group. 'The BRICS grouping is unlikely to achieve geopolitical coherence. China's relations with India are strained, as are Iran's with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, most member countries see participation in the BRICS as a means of expanding their freedom of foreign policy maneuver, not of positioning themselves against the West,' Wyne said. The shared ambitions of Beijing and Moscow may also be overshadowed by larger geopolitical priorities, the most notable being the war in Ukraine, analysts said. At the summit, China doubled down on its commitment to seeking a resolution of the war. Xi promoted the 'Friends of Peace' initiative, a collaborative effort led by China and Brazil to pursue a negotiated end to the conflict. U.S. and South Korean intelligence revealed the presence of an estimated 3,000 North Korean troops training in Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military intelligence service on Thursday put the number of North Koreans already in Russia at 12,000. The Kremlin at first dismissed reports of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Putin did not deny North Korean troops were in Russia. That deepening wartime collaboration between China’s two neighbors puts pressure on China and runs counter to its peacemaking ambitions. 'North Korea feels increasingly comfortable defying China's wishes, not only by increasing its nuclear and missile provocations in the Indo-Pacific, but also by fueling an armed conflict in a different theater at a time when Beijing seeks to portray itself as a potential peacemaker,' Wyne said. In June, Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a mutual defense treaty to strengthen military ties. North Korea also shares a similar treaty with China and is the only country to have entered a formalized agreement of this type with Beijing. 'China's challenge would be whether to fulfill its commitment to protect North Korea and potentially engage in a conflict with Ukraine. If North Korea were to enter the war, it would bring significant uncertainty to China-North Korea relations,' said Shanghai-based international relations scholar Dingli Shen. 'China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope that all parties will work for de-escalation and be committed to political settlement,' said Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington in a statement to VOA.

Malaysia: Govt Denies Allegations Najib Would Gain From House Arr...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia’s government denied Friday it was trying to ensure an early release for imprisoned ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak through a bill that would allow house arrest, saying it was intended to reduce prison overcrowding and punitive justice. Najib’s first public apology a day earlier for the 1MDB fund-looting scandal fueled further talk on social media that the proposed legislation was meant to benefit the former PM, who is implicated in the case. He currently has a little under four years left on his prison sentence. At a post-cabinet press conference, government spokesman Fahmi Fadzil was asked whether the bill, which is to be presented in parliament next year, was to enable Najib to serve out the remainder of his term from the comfort of his home. 'That’s incorrect. … It reflects a shift in the government’s approach from punitive to restorative justice, aiming to reintegrate individuals found guilty back into the community,' Fahmi told reporters. 'The government’s aim includes addressing prison overcrowding… [Our prisons are] designed for 74,000 inmates, but last year, we had 87,000.' Malaysia lacks legal provisions for home detention, unlike the U.S. and Australia, legal expert Salim Bashir told BenarNews. 'House arrest confines individuals at home for their sentence or remaining prison term,' said Salim, a former Bar Council of Malaysia president. 'While Malaysia’s Section 43 of the Prison Act 1952 allows certain prisoners to work and reside outside prison with approval, it’s not equivalent to house arrest.' Najib is serving time for corruption and money laundering tied to nearly U.S. $10 million from SRC International, a subsidiary of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund. Najib’s sentence is scheduled to end Aug. 23, 2028. In July, he sought a court order to enforce a document he claims was signed by the former king, allowing him to serve his sentence under house arrest, but a high court rejected his application. Najib argued that then-King Sultan Abdullah approved the order after giving him a partial royal pardonin Februarythat halved his original 12-year sentence. Najib challenged the denial of the alleged royal decree. The Court of Appeal has set Dec. 5 to hear the appeal, local media reported. Apology Many were taken aback Thursday when Najib’s eldest son, Mohamad Nizar, read out a letter by the incarcerated ex-PM that said he was 'deeply hurt' and 'in deep shock' that the 1MDB scandal occurred while he was in power. 'It pains me every day to know that the 1MDB debacle happened under my watch as minister of finance and prime minister. For that, I would like to apologize unreservedly to the Malaysian people,' Nizar read out from the letter outside the Kuala Lumpur High Court. In a separate case, a court will rule on Oct. 30 whether Najib must defend himself or be acquitted of charges tied to 1MDB, including four counts of abuse of power and 21 money laundering charges, involving 2.3 billion ringgit (U.S. $528.7 million) from the sovereign fund. When reporters asked him about the apology on Friday, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim responded: 'I received it well.' ‘Timing of the bill’ The house detention bill first came to light on Oct. 18 after Anwar presented the budget. Theofficial written versionof Anwar’s budget speech to parliament included a sentence about the government planning a law to allow some prisoners to serve time at home. The home minister, the next day, said the bill would be introduced in 2025. People on social media wondered why Anwar did not read out that part of his written speech in parliament, although it’s not uncommon for ministers to not read out every word of the budget.Political analyst Tunku Mohar Mokhtar said that 'the timing of the bill somehow gives rise to speculation that one of its reasons is to help secure Najib’s release.' '⁠We can’t read the intention behind the proposed bill, although at the same time, we can’t also rule out that this could be designed as a soft landing for Najib,' the analyst at the International Islamic University Malaysia told BenarNews. 'The timing of the bill somehow gives rise to speculation that one of its reasons is to help secure Najib’s release.' In addition to Najib’s July attempt to serve out his prison sentence at home, another recent event Tunku Mohar was referring to was the August general assembly of the UMNO party, a key ally of Prime Minister Anwar’s Pakatan Harapan coalition. During that meeting attended by more than 6,000 members, Najib’s release was the top demand, The Star, a local news website, reported. The prospect that Najib may be released from prison earlier has become a conversation topic in Malaysian politics ever since UMNO decided to back its long-time rival, Pakatan, in November 2022 to break the impasse of ahung parliament. Such speculation only intensified after a courtin September 2023dropped 47 graft charges against Deputy Prime Minister and UMNO leader Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, in a case linked to the alleged misuse of millions of dollars at a charity he founded to fight poverty. Anwar in ‘hard position’ Analysts say the government’s proposed house arrest law could be a compromise solution by Anwar to appease UMNO without fully freeing Najib from his sentence. 'Anwar is in a hard position having to balance the commitment to reform championed by his supporters and the push from certain quarters within UMNO to have Najib released, both matters that are critical to maintaining the balance and stability of his coalition,' Ahmad Mohsein Azman, an analyst at BowerGroupAsia, a political risk consultancy, told BenarNews. 'House arrest may conveniently be the right amount of compromise to manage expectations on both sides without having to absolve Najib from doing his time.' BenarNews reached out to several leaders of Pakatan and UMNO, but many declined to comment or did not respond to messages.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO1oV03NReYwm	2024-10-25T15:39:53-07:00	
Health Workers, Journalists Bear Brunt Of Israeli Strikes In Leba...	By Najia Houssari Lebanon accused Israel of targeting journalists in a 'deliberate' attack that killed three people in the country’s south on Friday, calling the incident a 'war crime.' Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the strike 'targeting journalists' was 'a war crime committed by Israel without any deterrent or international voice to halt the ongoing atrocities.' He added that the 'deliberate aggression aims to intimidate the media and obscure the crimes and destruction being perpetrated.' Mikati said he had directed the Foreign Ministry 'to include this latest crime in a series of documented files of Israeli crimes to be submitted to relevant international authorities, with the hope that global conscience will intervene to stop the ongoing violence.' Al-Mayadeen TV channel confirmed the deaths of broadcast technician Mohammed Rida and camera operator Ghassan Najjar, while Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV mourned the death of camera operator Wissam Qassim in the Israeli strike on a hotel in Hasbayya. Several other people including media personalities Zakaria Fadel, Hussein Hoteit, and Ali Chaib were injured in the blast. Survivors appeared on their respective TV channels covered in dirt in the aftermath, stressing that they did not have any weapons and that there 'weren’t any armed people' at the hotel. They added that they only had 'their cameras and microphones and that their movement was clear to everyone,' according to Al-Jadeed correspondent Mohamed Farhat and Al-Mayadeen reporter Fatima Ftouni, who showed her shrapnel-torn protective shield. The number of journalists, technicians, and photographers caught by Israeli hostilities since Oct. 8, 2023, has risen to 13. Lebanon’s Health Minister Firas Abiad said Israeli strikes killed more than 160 rescuers and health workers in the past year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. At a press conference on Friday, Abiad said 55 attacks on hospitals had been recorded, including 36 direct hits. Eight hospitals were forcibly closed down, while seven are partially operating. The attacks resulted in 'the martyrdom of 12 health workers, the injury of 60 people and the damage of 24 vehicles,' Abiad said. According to the minister, the latest Israeli attacks targeted '201 emergency response teams, bringing the total of casualties in the health and hospital sector to 163 martyred and 272 injured.' He said 51 emergency response centers, 158 ambulances, 57 fire trucks, and 15 rescue vehicles have been targeted. 'Two weeks ago, eight paramedics were martyred in the triangle of Odaisseh-Taybeh-Rab El-Thalathine. Their bodies are still in three ambulances due to the enemy’s refusal to allow the retrieval of their bodies. In addition, six firefighters are still under the rubble in Baraachit,' Abiad said. The Israeli military has targeted health workers, claiming that Hezbollah 'uses ambulances to transport members and weapons.' Avichay Adraee, spokesperson for the Israeli military, warned on Friday that troops could target medical personnel carrying out their duty of helping the injured in southern Lebanon. Adraee called on medical personnel to 'avoid engaging with Hezbollah members and cooperating with them. Otherwise, necessary action will be taken against any vehicle transporting armed people regardless of its type.' Adraee’s warning came as the UN Interim Force in Lebanon said that its peacekeepers withdrew from a watchtower in one of its posts near Dhayra in south Lebanon on Tuesday, after Israeli forces fired at it. UNIFIL senior leadership announced in a statement on Friday that 'peacekeepers on duty at a permanent observation post near Dhayra were observing Israeli soldiers conducting house clearing operations nearby.' The statement added: 'Upon realizing they were being observed, the soldiers fired at the post.' UNIFIL clarified that the duty guards 'withdrew following the incident to avoid being shot.' It also pointed out that the Israeli military had 'repeatedly demanded that UNIFIL vacate its positions along the Blue Line and has deliberately damaged camera, lighting, and communications equipment at some of these positions.' UNIFIL added: 'Despite the pressure exerted on the mission and our troop-contributing countries, peacekeepers remain in position and on task. 'We remind the Israeli army and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property. Any deliberate attack on them is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and Resolution 1701.' These developments were preceded and followed by Israeli raids on the southern suburbs of Beirut and towns in the south, in addition to the shelling of a second border crossing between Lebanon and Syria in the Qaa region in the Bekaa. The Masnaa border crossing was targeted once again, which limited the movement of cars and trucks between Lebanon and Syria to one crossing in northern Lebanon after the raids blocked traffic on the Masnaa crossing. People could only cross the border on foot and under the surveillance of Israeli reconnaissance aircraft. Hezbollah, meanwhile, launched a series of military operations targeting northern Israel. Israeli media reported that 'a state of emergency was declared in Nahariya Hospital due to a security event in Shomera in Western Galilee.' The party said it hit 'a gathering of soldiers who were sheltering inside a place considered to be safe. Additionally, a truck and several vehicles were hit by rockets launched from Lebanon.' Israeli media reported that 'four wounded people were in critical condition, in addition to other injuries of varying degrees, as a result of rockets fired by Hezbollah on the Shomera area.' Fires were still raging in the morning after Israeli airstrikes on Thursday night in El-Aamroussieh, Haret Hrek, and the Sainte Therese area, reaching Burj Al-Barajneh in Beirut’s southern suburbs. In the south, the Israeli military used phosphorous bombs to burn forests and olive groves in the border areas in the western sector. An airstrike on a house in the town of Bazourieh killed three people, whilst clashes between Hezbollah and Israel continued in the towns of Aitaroun, Taybeh, and Marwahin. Hezbollah said that it targeted Israeli military sites in the settlements of Al-Malikiyah and Al-Baghdadi. Relief efforts between Lebanon and international partners continued as a UAE ship docked at Beirut Port, delivering 2,000 tons of aid. This shipment, provided by the UAE, includes food supplies and essential equipment for shelter centers, offering critical support to the people of Lebanon. The Army Command announced the arrival of a donation from the Malta-Lebanon Organization to the Lebanese Army. A UNHCR spokeswoman estimated that around one-fifth of the Lebanese population has been displaced from their homes so far. She said the government-run displacement centers in Lebanon had become overcrowded, and that the number of people fleeing from Lebanon to Syria had reached 430,000. The Crisis and Disaster Management Room in the Beirut Governorate — in collaboration with the Farah Al-Ataa Association, a civil society organization, successfully relocated displaced people from tents along the Beirut waterfront to a shelter center in the Karantina area. In the initial phase, more than 400 displaced people were transferred, with the second phase set to be completed in the coming days.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO3iqiiu3Ckk3	2024-10-25T15:37:22-07:00	
Increasing Sign-Up Bonuses For Russian Soldiers Signal Falling Su...	Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of a partial mobilization in September 2022 backfired and sparked widespread anger, causing the emigration of more than a million young and educated people the Russian Federation could not afford to lose (see EDM, September 22, 2022, June 26, 2023). The Kremlin leader has since tried a variety of alternative tactics to fill the constantly depleting ranks of his invasion force in Ukraine. These have ranged from releasing convicts from prisons if they agree to serve in the army, to using immigrants or foreigners as soldiers, to raising the age limits on those subject to the draft or allowed to serve in the military (see EDM, October 31, 2023;Doxa, January 15; Verstka, October 9). By far, the most successful of these new approaches has been the increase in the number of signing bonuses for 'contract service' in the military (the Russian term for volunteers). The bonus system that has emerged over the last two years is run by the central government, which continues to announce large and ever-increasing sign-on payments and directs federal workers to continue increasing them. Russia’s wealthier regions now offer even more money in bonuses than the central government, often becoming the primary locations where poorer people sign up for contract service. Meanwhile, the poorer regions and republics are asking Moscow for additional assistance to boost their recruitment numbers. In the absence of federal assistance, these regions are forced to use coercion or offer bounties to relatives and acquaintances of men who bring such people to recruitment offices (Sibreal.org, April 27; Idelreal.org, July 14; see EDM, August 7). This is further dividing the Russian Federation between the urban haves and the rural have-nots, leading Russian political scientist Vladimir Pastukhov to suggest that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has become Russia’s last 'peasant war,' one fought not by the urban majority but by the country’s relatively small rural population, a group that disproportionately includes the non-Russian minorities (see EDM, October 4, 2022, April 4, July 16; Echofm.online, March 4, 2023). In recent months, the bonuses offered by Moscow and regional governments have reached an average of more than five million rubles ($50,000)—potentially more, depending on the region. This amounts to vastly more than most civilians in the Russian Federation can expect to earn over many years (T.me/svobodnieslova, September 4). The size of such payments has prompted some to suggest that, in rural Russia at least, most people have 'never had it so good,' and that people there have become and will remain loyal to Putin (Sibreal.org, September 17, 2023;Russia.post, September 19, 2023). This demonstrates how the bonus initiative is a success for Putin, who is more interested in having mercenaries than he is in having ideologically committed patriots who might begin asking the wrong questions (Window on Eurasia, March 6, 2023). Consequently, Vladislav Inozemtsev, the director of the Center of Research of Post-Industrial Society, speculates that the system is likely to remain in place well into 2025 because the population likes it and the Kremlin can afford it (Riddle, April 11). The rise in bonus payments reflects attitudes and trends in the Russian population that can hardly make the Kremlin happy. The fact that Moscow has to pay bonuses at all, and even more that they are compelled to raise these rates constantly, is a clear sign that there is decreasing enthusiasm for the war, however much polls suggest otherwise. The Kremlin’s need to continue raising bonus payments proves the lack of public support for Putin’s war. If support among the public was high, Russian men would be signing up out of patriotic enthusiasm, not for money (T.me/anatoly_nesmiyan, August 31, reposted at Charter97, August 31). Any real enthusiasm for the war has dissipated (if there ever was any at all), prompting Moscow to launch this unprecedented policy. Regardless of how happy Russians who do take the money may be, they and their countrymen can easily see that such payments reveal that the Kremlin’s situation has shifted. This has been exacerbated by the two groups of Russians most directly affected by the bonus system (Sibreal.org, October 17). The first, those who signed up earlier when bonuses were less, are currently suffering buyer’s remorse and are angry that they did not wait to get the larger payments. The second group, who may be considering signing up and getting the larger bonuses, is deciding to wait until the payments become even larger. Both are talking about their situations publicly, and that alone makes the bonus system increasingly counterproductive from the Kremlin’s point of view, possibly making it unsustainable far sooner than many now suggest. If that proves to be the case, then Putin will soon face a Hobson’s choice between carrying out a real mobilization and applying ever more repression. Doing so could possibly involve closing the borders to prevent Russians from fleeing, an action that could trigger his downfall. The other option is to change his approach in Ukraine altogether so that the Russian military’s need for soldiers would ease or even cease (The Moscow Times, August 21). As striking as the consequences of the bonus system are for the Russian military and the future of Putin’s war, his decision to offer them at all and then to regularly increase the size of the bonus may prove even more significant for the future of his political regime. Not only is the necessary boosting of such payments a real measure of declining Russian support for his war in Ukraine, but this trend shows to the Russian population that Putin is now ready to use cash and not just force to respond to resistance—something that makes opposition to his policies less risky. That will almost certainly encourage resistance to other parts of Putin’s political program, which, in turn, could form the roots of new and more serious challenges to the Putin regime (NG.ru, September 26).

Germany’s New Focus On India – Analysis	By Tobias Scholz Just one week ahead of the annual intergovernmental consultations, the German government published its first strategic document solely focused on its engagement with India. Although not officially labelled a strategy, the paper’s cabinet-level-involvement and clear prioritisation of policy domains make 'Focus on India' a comprehensive manual outlining Germany’s planned approach towards India. In laying out Germany’s ideas about the imagined future of Indo-German foreign, security, and trade relations, the public document has both a domestic and an external function. Domestically, the key role of 'Focus on India' is to bring all government departments on the same page. Externally, it sends a strong message of assurance to India, signalling the high standing India currently enjoys among political decision-makers in Germany. The 'new focus': A result of geopolitical threats While trade, migration, and technology cooperation have undoubtedly become more significant for German-Indian relations, security concerns have recently introduced a strategic depth into the partnership. For the past few years, both partners have been geopolitically threatened by revisionist powers. The Galwan skirmishes with China in 2020 made India rethink its China policy. For Germany, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 challenged the 'Wandel durch Handel' (change through trade) approach towards Russia. Furthermore, subsequent attempts to condemn Russia’s behaviour at the United Nations (UN) illustrated to Germany how strong and long-standing New Delhi’s partnership with Moscow has been in the past. Neighbourhood challenges were central for both Germany and India to find new interest in each other as they sought to identify new partners as well as diversify their external dependencies. India’s behaviour towards Russia posed a dilemma for Germany’s foreign policy. On the one hand, the German government realised that India was not a geopolitical ally when it came to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. On the other hand, Germany viewed India as a key strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific and an important representative of the Global South. In other words, Germany had to consider how to deal with a partner that also partners with its geopolitical rival. India’s multi-aligned preferences have, in particular, been at odds with Germany’s established strategic practice, which centres on treaty-based alliance cooperation. The first-ever public strategic document by Germany to describe foreign policy priorities towards India can be read as a recognition of India’s relevance in balancing China, as well as the complexities of dealing with a strategically autonomous India. Strategic depth through security cooperation 'Focus on India' fulfils two functions: firstly, it offers a comprehensive inventory of the existing partnership, covering policy domains as diverse as judicial, civil society, and sub-national cooperation. Secondly, and perhaps more relevant for the upcoming government consultations, the Federal Foreign Office-led approach aims to advance new partnership propositions. Three sets of suggestions stand out: the upsizing of government consultations, the willingness to become a major security partner, and a more strategic view on climate and energy cooperation. If the suggestions from the federal government in Berlin are enacted, the bilateral relations could soon become far more comprehensive. A key proposition is introducing the Indo-German dialogue forum to enrich the bi-annual government consultations with more input and feedback. While the dialogue forum is proposed to become the overarching discussion platform, 'Focus on India' emphasises the need to expand on former or existing dialogues across several issues, ranging from cybersecurity to climate policy. What is not mentioned, however, is the required structure to manage the multitude of dialogues. The most feasible path appears to be that all sectoral dialogue formats are forth on held as sub-tracks of the overarching dialogue forum. At least some coordination between the dialogue forum and the policy tracks will be needed to ensure efficiency and coherence. The strategic document’s most significant policy announcements relate to bilateral security relations. Most far-reaching, the German Federal Government seeks to establish an agreement on reciprocal logistical support between the German and Indian armed forces. The proposition ties into Germany’s interest in strengthening India’s defensive capacities in the Indo-Pacific and reducing its military dependence on Russia. Germany’s interest to second a Bundeswehr liaison officer to the Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean Region in New Delhi underlines the growing interest in understanding India’s concerns in the Indo-Pacific. These efforts build on Germany’s broader Indo-Pacific approachpublishedin 2020 and its commissioning of a frigate into the region in 2021. The document’s commitment to ease arms export control procedures, however, raises more questions than it answers. While the announcement aligns with the prevailing tonality of 'Focus on India', the types of arms are not specified, which could fuel domestic debates in Germany about the scope of its new arms export policy to India. A narrower focus on arms cooperation to advance each other’s defensive capabilities may be more realistic. A final novelty of 'Focus on India' is the strategic depth which it provides to the partnership by drawing connections between interests in different policy areas. The most remarkable example is the direct linkage of climate cooperation and energy security. Publicly linking these two goals indicates that the rationale of Germany’s development partnership with India could become far more geo-economically aware. The proposed dialogue platform would be an ideal venue to explore further synergies between policy domains. Beyond good vibes 'Focus on India' combines an interests-based approach with a good amount of pragmatism. In areas where cooperation is already increasing, like in security, climate, and technology policy, the German government makes pertinent new suggestions. However, in areas where the partnership previously faced challenges, like in multilateral cooperation or the EU-India Free Trade Agreement, the strategic document does not pitch completely new ideas. Essentially, 'Focus on India' addresses the bilateral partnership by reinforcing those policy domains where Germany already sees progress and opportunities. The advantage of such an approach is that the strategic document can certainly prove a useful conversation starter for the seventh governmental consultation this week. For the strategic partnership to mature more progressively and withstand pressure, however, frank discussions on the areas of discern remain paramount. This includes a clear idea of each other’s red lines as well as an understanding of the involved risks for the partnership. It is therefore important that the suggested Indo-German dialogue forum, if implemented, becomes a multistakeholder platform in which candid conversations about progress as much as challenges are invited to take place. Equally important, Germany’s approach can benefit from and learn from the experiences of EU-India relations, which remain pivotal in shaping trade relations between the two powers.

Malaysia’s New Citizenship Law Maintains Regressive Measures – An...	By Bridget Welsh Last week Malaysia passed a new Constitutional amendment correcting a gender discriminatory measure that denied citizenship to children born to Malaysian mothers overseas. Malaysian fathers whose children were born abroad always had that right, which had been denied to mothers. Now children born overseas to both Malaysian women and men can become citizens. The legislation was portrayed as a reason to celebrate. Indeed, for mothers, it corrects a long-standing injustice. The other amendments and details of the legislation, however, suggest the opposite. Anwar Ibrahim’s government packed the legislation with measures that increase statelessness, extend gender discrimination, and harm children, especially from minority and vulnerable communities. The associated amendments to the Constitution are among the most regressive in Malaysian history, curtailing the ability to address the serious problem of more than 1 million undocumented persons in the country, including over 100,000 undocumented children born in Malaysia. Rather than give citizenship to more people, the new legislation takes it away from individuals. First of all, the provisions related to mothers whose children are born overseas, do not apply retroactively. This leaves the thousands of children born to Malaysian mothers overseas before the bill’s passage without legal protections to acquire Malaysian citizenship. Activists advocating for equality of citizenship laws highlighted the anguish of families divided by the inability to live as a unit and the discrimination faced by siblings born overseas who are denied the same rights and access to public education, health care and other services. Children born overseas to Malaysian mothers have also faced psychological harm, been branded as unworthy and excluded in the country’s society. These families and children will continue to suffer. Regressive measures One of the newamendments also target women, bringing back gender discrimination. The government can now revoke the citizenship of foreign spouses of Malaysian men if their marriage ends within two years of their citizenship application, rather than within two years of the marriage itself. The measure expands the power of the Malaysian government to control the citizenship status of foreign wives. This leaves women in abusive marriages and children from the marriage highly vulnerable. Women in Malaysia in abusive marriages have disproportionately received little support from Malaysian authorities. The case of M. Indira Gandhi whose daughter was abducted by her ex-husband in 2009 is illustrative. Authorities failed to issue an arrest warrant on the father to return their daughter to the mother’s custody despite multiple court orders, including a landmark decision by the Federal Court in 2018. A civil suit against the police claiming they were acting in bad faith by supporting the husband was dismissed last July. She has not seen her daughter for over fifteen years. There are concerns that the new citizenship amendments give additional leverage to abusive men to hold over their spouses. To make matters worse, the amendments make it more difficult for children to apply for citizenship by reducing the age limit for applying, to 18 years old from 21. Given that applications take on average five years for review, this limits the ability of children to address issues in the review process. Clearly, one of the aims of the legislation was to reduce pathways to citizenship, and in fact, to make them harder. This most devastating measure involves the denial of citizenship for foundlings, orphans and children of permanent residents born in Malaysia. This change will particularly impact children of the indigenous Orang Asli communities, whose lack of proper citizenship documentation reflects endemic neglect of this community. Other minorities, such as the Indians and the ethnic communities in Borneo, face similar exclusion. The bill’s anti-minority overtones have created considerable disquiet. Growing statelessness problem Worryingly, these amendments add to the already serious problem of statelessness, and make solutions to it more difficult. The primary reason these measures denying citizenship for foundlings and permanent residents’ children were included in the legislation stems from 40 years of mismanagement of migration in the state of Sabah. From the 1980s, migrants were brought in to marginalize the political influence of local ethnic minorities and to strengthen the political position of the federal government under what was called Project IC, one of the darkest projects of the tenure of the former Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. Not only did Project IC change the demography of Sabah, it also left a horrible legacy. Now, over an estimated 1 million people, including around 100,000 children, without proper documentation live in desolate poverty, and are denied public education and health care. They are subject to greater labour exploitation and abuse than most others as they try to eke out a precarious living. And with multiple generations condemned to repeat this cycle, they have been condemned to a life of criminality and marginality. At the same time, undocumented persons are deeply resented by indigenous communities that have been politically displaced. They are also demonised as they are perceived as adding to Sabah’s border security problems. This issue remains emotive among Sabahans. The legislation’s inclusion of amendments that target children was part of a compromise to ensure the support of enough politicians so the law could pass. Tragically, the legislation targets and perpetuates statelessness for future generations. Rather than work to undo the dark legacy of Mahathir’s Project IC in Sabah, Malaysia’s new citizenship legislation makes problems worse. Beyond adding to the numbers of undocumented persons, targeting children creates another excluded generation that will tear at the fabric of Sabah society and be detrimental to the goal of sustainable development. When civil society began to push for changes in the citizenship law, the aim was to expand citizenship, especially for children and families. Malaysia’s regressive new measures do not do this. Many in Malaysian civil society are devastated by how the legislation was hijacked to curtail rights. The bill was an opportunity to correct injustices. Instead, Anwar Ibrahim’s government has widened them.

Vietnam’s Cross-Border Trade Regulation Adjustments Impact China’...	By He Yan At the invitation of Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính, Chinese Premier Li Qiang made an official visit to Vietnam from October 12 to 14. In a joint statement released by the two countries on the 14th, they emphasized the importance of leveraging the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA), utilizing platforms like e-commerce and exhibitions, enhancing customs cooperation, and expanding the export of each country's competitive products to the other. The Vietnamese government recently issued Decree No. 122 concerning small-scale exports to China to promote long-term sustainable trade development between the two countries. According to this decree, Vietnam will officially cease unofficial-quota exports to China on January 1, 2030, and all import and export activities must be conducted through international ports or major bilateral ports. Additionally, it supplements and revises several provisions regarding trade standards and payment methods, aiming to improve the standardization of border trade between Vietnam and China. It is reported that this resolution will take effect on December 1, 2024. The Vietnamese government has previously promoted trade with China through cross-border small-scale trade. Such unofficial quota exports refer to a trade method where residents or businesses in border areas conduct small-scale trade by exporting goods in limited quantities to neighboring markets. Over the years, Vietnam's small-scale quota exports to China have been very active, with products mainly including durians, bird's nests, sweet potatoes, dragon fruits, longans, passion fruits, and other agricultural products, as well as shrimps, crabs, salmons, squids, pollocks, cod, and hawthorn fish. However, with the expansion of trade scale and increasing congestion at border ports, the Vietnamese government has begun to gradually tighten relevant policies. The Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam stated that tightening small-scale goods exports aims to bring daily commodity exchanges and sales activities among border residents back on track. This ensures that exports to China comply with international practices, meet quality requirements, and can be traced back to their origin, thereby avoiding the congestion of agricultural products at border ports as seen in the past. In the short term, the implementation of Vietnam's Decree No. 122 will have a significant impact on the current trade pattern between the two countries, placing adjustment pressures on businesses and individuals that rely on cross-border small-scale trade, as well as on border cities. According to surveys, Vietnam's regulations on cross-border goods transactions are relatively lenient, especially regarding exports. Therefore, individual traders who do not have business registration can engage in cross-border export activities as long as they reside in border areas, provided they do not involve prohibited export goods. These traders are allowed to create their own lists of goods, which serve as substitutes for contracts, eliminating the need to submit formal export documents such as sales contracts or invoices to customs. The payment methods also demonstrate considerable flexibility, including various forms such as bank transfers, cash transactions, and bartering. As a result, even though certain Vietnamese agricultural products, for instance, various fruits and pork, have not yet received formal import permits from China, these products can still be sold in the Chinese market through small-scale trade quotas among border residents. Moreover, many traders are leveraging the small-scale quota export method to conduct large-scale trade activities. They do this by establishing lists of regular border residents and pooling their duty-free allowances to import large quantities of goods. Even for products that have already received formal export permits to China (such as cassava products and lychees), there is a tendency to export them through small-scale quotas. For example, Vietnam exports over 3 million tons of cassava starch to China each year, with 60% of that amount exported via small-scale quotas. Although small-scale quota exports account for only a small portion of Vietnam's official total exports to China, they have become an important channel for products that have not yet received formal export permits to China or that do not meet export requirements. Currently, the new regulations mandate that border residents must be physically present to complete the goods handover procedures, which will undoubtedly increase their participation costs and time expenses. For those accustomed to convenient and flexible trading, this requirement may diminish their enthusiasm for participating in mutual trade, thereby affecting the activity levels of border trade. Border trade not only provides an economic source for residents in border areas but also promotes commercial exchanges and local economic development between Vietnam and China. If the scale of border trade shrinks, the local business environment and residents' income could suffer negative impacts. Clearly, the mutual trade activities of border residents are being disrupted, which will significantly impact the border trade cities in China. Taking the Dongxing Port in Guangxi as an example, it is the only first-class port in China that connects with Vietnam by land and sea, located just 100 meters from Móng Cái in Vietnam. Previously, Dongxing Port offered convenient services such as self-service customs clearance, allowing both travelers and those engaged in cross-border trade to come and go easily. Dongxing Port sees a high volume of border trade personnel, with its inbound and outbound passenger flow ranking first among land border ports in Guangxi. Such border port cities are significantly affected by the adjustments in Vietnam's border trade policies. In addition to the port cities, other nearby cities reliant on the ports, such as Kunming, Ruili, Pu'er, Wenshan, Baise, and Chongzuo, will also be impacted to varying degrees. However, from a long-term perspective, the new regulations also provide opportunities for standardization, industrial upgrading, and infrastructure improvement in the Vietnam-China cross-border trade. Firstly, there is a tightening of payment methods and product standards. Vietnam's Decree No. 122 supplements Decree No. 14 from 2018, explicitly outlining the payment methods for cross-border trade activities. It also introduces Article 4a regarding product standards, requiring that all goods involved in cross-border transactions must meet the legal standards and quality requirements of the importing country. This regulation aims to enhance the traceability and overall quality of traded goods. According to the resolution, the main payment methods for border trade activities include bank payments, settlement payments between exported goods and services and imported goods and services (with any differences settled through bank payments), as well as cash payments. However, under the new regulations, cash payment methods are only applicable to the buying, selling, and exchanging of goods by border residents. Secondly, Decree No. 122 will focus on promoting the upgrading and structural optimization of industries along Vietnam's border. Specifically, this resolution aims to encourage Vietnamese border enterprises to continually enhance the quality and standards of their products to better meet the growing demand in the Chinese market. Through this process, companies will place greater emphasis on managing production processes and fostering technological innovation, thereby improving overall production efficiency and product quality. This will not only enhance the competitiveness of Vietnamese products in the Chinese market but also drive economic development in border areas, achieving optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure. In addition, China and Vietnam may further enhance the construction and investment in border ports to adapt to the changes in trade patterns brought about by the new regulations. This includes large-scale improvements and upgrades to the infrastructure of border ports to enhance the customs clearance environment and efficiency. Particularly for specific ports that require centralized processing of import and export procedures, improving customs clearance efficiency and cargo transport capacity is especially important. This will not only facilitate trade between the two countries but also further strengthen economic cooperation and exchanges between them. Final analysis conclusion: The recently issued Decree No. 122 by Vietnam will have an impact on Vietnam-China border trade, particularly for border residents, businesses, and cities that rely on small-scale trade, which may face certain adjustment pressures. However, from a long-term perspective, this new regulation will also bring opportunities for standardization, industrial upgrading, and infrastructure improvement in the cross-border trade of both countries.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e5z8jCktGlx2y	2024-10-24T16:47:49-07:00	
Gold’s Future Depends Crucially On China – OpEd	By Brendan Brown It is hard to exaggerate the importance of China in the future of gold even if the relationship falls short of monocausal. Beijing’s actual course both in economic policy and geopolitics since its giant bubble economy turned to bust — starting circa 2020 — has had a huge bearing on gold’s super-strong performance. By contrast if the bust were to spark somehow a triumph of economic and political freedom in China, a continuing stellar rise for gold would depend, most likely, on a further collapse of general confidence in fiat money led by the dollar hegemon. The roots of gold’s dependence on China do not figure at all in the conventional IMF/Keynesian analysis of the present 'malinvestment problem' in that country. According to this analysis the huge loss of private wealth corresponding to the suddenly apparent total economic obsolescence of 80 million empty apartments has caused a sharp rise in China’s private sector savings surplus. That presents supposedly a twin menace of internal deflation and trade imbalance with the rest of the world. Markets Are the Solution How to reduce that menace (according to IMF/Keynesians)? Beijing policy makers must unleash giant fiscal and monetary stimulus. And they must not take any actions which would stoke the tendency towards an ever-larger Chinese trade surplus in the wake of bubble-busting. The premise of these prescriptions is plain wrong. They provide no scope for the invisible hands. Yes, the revelation of pervasive malinvestment goes along with a widespread loss of perceived well-being in China. That means in the first instance a sogginess of consumer spending. The invisible hands, however, in a well-functioning market economy with sound money, should operate in the direction of incentivizing new capital spending amidst the destruction of much old capital stock. A fall in wage-rates across important sectors of the economy, accompanied by a widening of perceived profit opportunities, would bring an upturn in business investment, much of it in new areas of activity. Foreign firms would participate alongside domestic ones. The bust — and related wipe-out of capital stock — means China would have retreated down the list of emerging market economies to where capital is scarcer as a factor of production. In this situation, China would attract enhanced capital inflows with a counterpart in smaller trade surpluses or even trade deficits. More generally, in the post-bubble Chinese economy many prices of goods and services under sound money would have fallen to well below their long-run path, incentivizing individuals and businesses to bring forward spending. The Keynesians who revile 'deflation' just do not get the plot and instead perversely welcome evidence of price rises. These are, in fact, symptomatic of new supply restraints including the fall-out from trade confrontation. There has been little prospect of invisible hands operating in the ways described for China. Foreign investors, most of all in the US, are highly risk-averse regarding ploughing capital into the post-bust Chinese economy — whether due to the hostile attitude of Beijing or out of fear about actions by the US authorities. The Chinese Regime Sees More Inflation as the Solution In view of actual foreign restrictions on Chinese export growth and the serious handicaps to a spontaneous upturn in business investment, policy makers in Beijing see only one possible exit from the economic doldrums. This is an increase in state spending paid for by camouflaged monetary taxation (inflation tax and financial repression). The prospect of likely inflation becomes even stronger when we consider the squeeze on real incomes in China due to stepped up economic warfare with the US. Lowered incomes with no solid hope of improvement ahead surely add to political discontent below the surface. The hierarchy in Beijing will counter this by so-called monetary stimulus or by command-economy measures. No wonder Chinese savers who imagine any of this either explicitly or intuitively see gold as the sparkling refuge —much more so than the dollar in any form. Chinese savers, like other foreign savers, are also aware that that the US will act where possible against local deposit-taking institutions suspected of financing proscribed activities (for example aiding the Russian war economy). Yes, there is the possibility, in principle, of seeking refuge in the wild digital space of crypto assets; in practice, though, this has faced bans in China for many years. A China-Based Network of 'Gold Banks'? The Chinese authorities have no problem with the 'flight into gold' in this nation where private and government sectors together hold the yellow metal to a greater extent than in any other nation including the US; total private and state holdings could be as high as 15% of above ground gold stocks worldwide. Perhaps they appreciate the feel-good factor in gold holdings for the ordinary citizen and how this might dampen political discontent. It is possible that the Chinese authorities could take their sponsorship of gold as safe haven a stage further. They could tolerate and indeed encourage the growth of a payments network based on gold. In effect this would consist of safekeeping institutions that issue certificates of deposits with high mandatory physical gold backing (even 100 per cent for the safest certificates). This payments network could extend to countries friendly with China (who refuse to side with US in trade policy), many in the emerging market world. Shanghai would be the likely point of delivery in this network for physical gold against deposits. Japan’s Limited Options For obvious reasons, as a US ally, Japan could not be part of the network. But in general, the demand for gold as haven has a growing and weighty Asian component, including Japan. That country finds itself exposed to peril in a US-China economic war. For example, US prohibitive actions against China imports may well have a counterpart in Chinese enterprises stepping up their sales efforts in third party countries of which Japan would be top of the list. Japanese investors have every reason to fear that a cheap yen and monetary inflation would become the staple response of their government, especially given its massive debts. Unlike for China, US dollar securities held in Japan are not subject to political risk and have functioned well as a haven in recent years. But doubts may well grow amongst the Japanese that such a one-way track can continue and there are scenarios where Tokyo-Washington relations could become much more tense. Despite much of the public talk about US-Japan closeness, a third way for Tokyo is not foreclosed. The builder of scenarios about US-Japan frictions, including Japan’s continuing and likely growing dependence on Sakhalin oil and gas, could question Japan’s participation in a military response to potential Chinese aggression against Taiwan. Bottom line: the huge importance of China to the future of gold does not just lie in the impoverishing of that country by economic war with the US and the devastation of mal investment. The demand for safe haven amongst savers generally in East Asia who are only too aware of risks stemming from the China-US economic war is also highly relevant.

Pakistan’s Struggle To Secure Gulf Investments Amid Economic Cris...	By Saima Nawaz Pakistan’s economic situation is teetering on the brink as the country is facing a perilous financial crisis, scrambling to secure external financing to meet growing obligations. The country has received only temporary relief from a US$7 billionstaff-level agreementwith the International Monetary Fund. Pakistan’s financing need for the 2023–2024 fiscal year is estimated atUS$25 billion. To bridge this gap, Pakistan has turned to its traditional allies — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and China — to seek additional financial support, debt restructuring and foreign direct investment (FDI). Pakistan aims to re-profile US$12 billionin bilateral debt, with US$3 billion owed to the UAE, US$4 billion to China and US$5 billion to Saudi Arabia. The goal is to extend the repayment of these loans over the next three to five years, providing Pakistan with a more stable financial foundation. Pakistan has opened the door to Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, through theSpecial Investment Facilitation Council— a platform to attract FDI in key sectors such as agriculture, mining, energy and infrastructure.FDI increasedto US$1.9 billion in 2023–2024 fiscal year compared to US$1.6 billion in 2022–23 fiscal year, a 17 per cent increase. Although China remains the largest contributor, there has been an increase in FDI from Saudi Arabia and UAE, rising from US$1 million to US$10 million over the 2022–2023 fiscal year. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have shown interest in agriculture and mining, sectors where significant investment opportunities exist. These investments align with their broader strategies —Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030and the UAE’s post-oil economy strategy — to diversify their economy away from oil dependency and expand their global influence. By investing in Pakistan, both nations seek to strengthen their diplomatic ties and economic presence in South Asia, tap into new markets and expand their geopolitical reach. Pakistan has actively invitedSaudi Arabia and the UAEto invest in specific projects identified through thePakistan Sovereign Wealth Fund, which includes state-owned enterprises. Pakistan hopes these countries will make significant investments as iturgently needsforeign exchange and economic stimulus. The strong historical ties, people-to-people connections and growing alignment of business interests between Pakistan and these Gulf nations provide an additional layer of optimism. The government believes that attracting investments from Saudi Arabia and the UAE would significantly boost Pakistan’s economic activity and provide much needed support during these difficult times. But Pakistan has yet to make significant improvement in its investment environment. In May 2024, a Saudi delegationvisited Pakistanto evaluate the proposed investments but chose not to proceed, citing that the projects did not meet their investment criteria. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE are looking for well-structured and high-yield investments, not ventures driven solely by historical ties. Saudi Arabiamade it clearthat ‘We are taxing our people, we are expecting also others to do the same, to do their efforts. We want to help but we want you also to do your part’. This response underscores the structural issue and distrust within Saudi financial circles towards Pakistan’s fiscal management. Pakistan must improve its presentation of investment opportunities to meet international standards and attract investors seeking robust returns, independent of geo-political and historical pressures. Several systemic problems in Pakistan need to be addressed to attract and retain significant investments. Regulatory inefficiencies and a burdensome taxation system are major barriers. Investors often only realise these challenges after committing, finding themselves entangled in a complex web of predatory tax regimes, rent-seeking practices, elite captures, capital and financial market issues, and unpredictable exchange rate policies. These issues force companies to spend considerable time and resources seeking exemptions or other forms of relief, a process that is inefficient and unattractive at the international level. Investors seek policy certainty, long-term stability and aconducive political environment. The economic cost ofpolitical instabilityisaround 3 per cent of GDP. To attract investments from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other potential investors, Pakistan must create a more stable, transparent and investor-friendly environment. Its regulatory framework, particularly regarding foreign investment and funds repatriation, may not be sufficiently conducive to attract Gulf capital. High debt levels and concerns about financial management could further deter Gulf investors. The potential for attracting investment from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE is promising, especially as these nations actively expand their global economic footprint. If Pakistan can present attractive and well-structured projects, it could encourage these countries to increase their investment levels. But the focus must be on greenfield investments — those that create new infrastructure and opportunities in sectors with minimal domestic competition. Brownfield investments through partnerships with local businesses also have potential, as local businesses can provide the trust required within the system. When foreign investments are heavily incentivised by the government, it is more difficult for local businesses to remain competitive. Foreign investors may be drawn more by the incentive than the business opportunity, leading to market imbalance where foreign entities dominate at the expense of local industries. A cautionary example is theKarachi Electric Supply Company, where ongoing subsidies to private investors have become a financial burden rather than an asset. Such investments create liabilities without offering long-term economic benefits. Pakistan must carefully evaluate the nature of the investments it seeks. The government should prioritise projects that contribute positively to the economy, avoid creating perpetual financial liabilities and ensure that any sale or lease of national assets does not prioritise short-term gains over long-term economic growth. FDI can only come as complementary to domestic investment efforts. Thoughtful planning and strategic alignment with domestic market dynamics will be essential to ensuring that investments benefit the country’s future.

Women Killed In Armed Conflicts Doubles In 2023 – OpEd	By Caroline Mawanga New York | 23 October 2024 (IDN) — A new UN report onWomen, Peace, and Security, led byUN Women, has painted dismal picture: The effects of war and conflict on women and girls are worsening. In 2023, the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubled compared to 2022. Four out of every ten people who died because of conflict in 2023 were women. UN-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence swelled by 50 per cent. These increases in deaths during war and in violence against women are taking place against a backdrop of increasing blatant disregard of international law designed to protect women and children during war, says the report by UN Secretary-General António Guterres. The report comes 24 years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325, which called for all parties to conflicts to ensure the safety of women and girls, and for women’s full involvement in peace processes. For example, women in war zones are also increasingly suffering from restricted access to healthcare. Every day, 500 women and girls in conflict-affected countries die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. By the end of 2023, 180 women were giving birth every day in war-torn Gaza—most without necessities or medical care. 'Women continue to pay the price of the wars of men,' said UN Women Executive Director, Sima Bahous. 'This is happening in the context of a larger war on women. The deliberate targeting of women’s rights is not unique to conflict-affected countries but is even more lethal in those settings. We are witnessing the weaponization of gender equality on many fronts, if we do not stand up and demand change, the consequences will be felt for decades, and peace will remain elusive' she added. Despite commitments to ensure women’s full and meaningful participation in peace and security matters made over many years, political and military power and decision-making around conflicts continue to be overwhelmingly dominated by men. Women comprised only 9.6 per cent of negotiators in peace processes in 2023, even though studies show that when women are involved, peace agreements last longer and are better implemented. Severe lack of funding In Yemen, for example, women-led negotiations resulted in safe access to a water source for civilians. In Sudan, 49 women-led organizations are pushing for a more inclusive peace process. These efforts are largely unsupported or unrecognized in formal peace negotiations. The UN report identifies the severe lack of funding as one of the key challenges in realizing women, peace and security commitments. In 2023, global military expenditures reached a record $2.44 trillion. In contrast, funding for organizations and movements supporting women’s rights continues to fall short, averaging just 0.3 per cent of total aid annually—especially in conflict-affected areas. Investments in gender-based violence prevention and response make up less than one per cent of all humanitarian spending. In 2025, the world will reach a series of anniversaries of significant global actions that were intended to promote gender equality and human rights for everybody, most notably the 30th commemoration of the Beijing Platform for Action, the most visionary blueprint on women’s rights ever adopted by 189 countries. The report concludes that only through bold political action and increased funding, will women’s equal and meaningful participation in peace and security become a reality: a reality that is essential for achieving lasting peace for all. In the Ukraine war, women are on the front lines and leading recovery Women have been on the front lines of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Their suffering has been disproportionate and relentless, withwomen and children making up almost 90 per cent of people fleeing the war. But that is not the whole picture. Women are also humanitarian actors, community leaders, and providers for their families. One in every two businesses in Ukraine is founded by a woman. Ukrainian women are also taking on more roles in traditionally male-dominated professions, such as the security sector, transit, and demining. Since Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, women’s rights organizations and women leaders have been providing humanitarian assistance, advocating for women’s rights, taking on leadership roles in business and in politics, and many have joined the armed forces.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e5whpai894sOD	2024-10-24T16:44:34-07:00	
CNBC Hides Extent To Which Trump Tax Proposal Would Hurt Moderate...	CNBC, which is owned and controlled by people who will pay lower taxes with Donald Trump back in the White House, ran a PRpiecefor Donald Trump’s tax agenda. The piece is headlined 'Trump Tax Plans Could Exempt 93 Million Americans From Income Tax.' The piece highlights several proposals that Trump has thrown out with virtually no specifics, such as exempting firefighters, police, and veterans from taxes as well as overtime wages. It concludes that this could exempt 93 million people from income taxes. Trump has proposed to offset this lost revenue with taxes on imports. Since most of the people who CNBC now says would be exempt from income tax already pay little or no income tax, they would almost certainly be paying far more money in taxes on imports than they pay now in income tax. For example, a family of four with an income of $60,000 and two kids, would currently pay nothing in income taxes. We don’t know how high Trump will actually make his import taxes (he keeps throwing out higher numbers), but if we start with his 20 percent and 60 percent on China, this would come to an average of close to 30 percent. With goods imports at roughly 13 percent of GDP, this would translate into a tax of roughly 4.0 percent. If this family spends all their income this would come to a tax burden of $2,400 a year. This family, as well as most other moderate and middle-income families, would fare much worse under the Trump tax plan than the current system. CNBC has managed to flip reality on its head and imply that these people will somehow be better off with the more regressive tax plan Trump is putting forward. It is unfortunate that they could not present the views ofsomeonefamiliar with the tax code.

The Collapse Of Tehran’s Strategic Depth – OpEd	The political balance of power in the Middle East has dramatically shifted against Iran’s regime. Continuous blows to the regime’s proxy forces have created an unprecedented situation for the regime, one that it has never experienced before. These changes are happening at a time when the regime neither has the capacity to respond to these challenges nor can it afford to sit idly by. In both cases, the outcome spells defeat for the regime. For more than three decades, the regime survived through its proxy forces, trying to expand its influence and operational reach. But now, these forces are constantly under pressure and are being damaged. This situation has created serious challenges for the regime, directly impacting on its internal stability and security. The regime is more aware than anyone of the simmering unrest at home, and in fact, all its recent provocations have been aimed at diverting attention away from Iran’s internal problems. Democratic or even semi-democratic governments derive their survival and legitimacy from the votes of their citizens. These governments step aside after their term of power ends. They either exit the political stage or retreat into the background, waiting for the next cycle. However, in dictatorial regimes, there are no fundamental changes. The tyrant remains at the top of the hierarchy and rules as long as possible. The so-called elected officials only serve the purposes of the unelected leaders. In such dictatorships, the regime’s stability and survival depend on factors outside the people’s will. For the mullahs’ regime, the motivating factor for its forces and agents is embodied in 'exporting terrorism and warmongering.' This is why regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei considers Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Palestine as his regime’s 'strategic depth' and uses this as a pretext to mobilize his Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and Basij forces. He needs to show his power in tangible ways to keep the repressive forces and criminals around him to defend his regime. As a result, he constantly boasted that he had control over four Arab capitals, and he ordered his proxies to publicly declare his support for them at every platform. In other words, Khamenei has kept the IRGC, Basij, and plainclothes agents active for all these years by inflating the role of his proxy forces. The propaganda surrounding Hezbollah’s 150,000 missiles ready to launch was part of this strategy. He knew that if he stopped terrorism and warmongering through his proxies, as the regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini put it, the 'spirit of Supreme Leader' would deflate. He knew that the criminals who keep his regime in power are all slaves to power. If they sense that their Supreme Leader is politically and militarily powerless, they will disintegrate quickly. It is due to the collapse of this strategic depth and the disintegration of its proxies that fear has engulfed the regime. With the regime losing its regional power, no one has hope for tomorrow anymore. In a speech to the regime’s loyal base, Majlis (Parliament) speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf repeatedly used the phrase 'let’s not be afraid!' At the same time, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has resorted to trips in the region, pleading with various countries to mediate and prevent the outbreak of war. A country like Lebanon, which was once under the regime’s control, is now packing up its relationship with the regime and summoning its ambassador for every misstep. Even Syria is no longer showing a friendly face to the regime and is quietly distancing itself from the regime and its so-called 'Resistance Axis.' One of the regime’s experts expressed fear on television, saying: 'Today the situation is more dangerous than last year. The U.S. has brought it refueling planes to the region, and the B-52 bomber has entered the area!' (Source: Regime TV – October 17) The regime’s Friday prayer leaders are also lamenting the wave of defections and 'hopelessness' among the regime’s loyal forces, complaining that 'some of these analyses come from cowardly people and are driven by enemy threats and exaggerations… These analyses lead to hopelessness, negativity, and the weakening of officials, and sometimes even our most loyal forces fall into the trap of these analyses.' Thus, the regime’s strongholds in the Middle East are collapsing one after another, and this is the same 'strategic defeat' that the Iranian Resistance predicted a year ago at the beginning of Khamenei’s warmongering. Now, with protests flaring up and the people’s anger exploding in this volatile society, we will witness even more waves of fear, hopelessness, demotivation, and defections within the regime’s internal forces.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e59RPCjlhk9FW	2024-10-24T16:39:10-07:00	
Has MBS Paved Way For Netanyahu To Target Iran Through A Fictitio...	Ever since Iran launched on 1 October, an unparalleled large-scale attack - using a barrage of nearly 200 ballistic missiles - against Israel, the Middle East has been holding its breath in anticipation of a swift and crushing Israeli retaliation. Iran said its long-awaited attack was in response to Israel's assassinations of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) officer in Beirut, and of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran US President Joe Biden has made no secret that - unlike in April when he asked Israel to refrain from responding to Iran's first ever direct attack on Israel- he would support Israel's decision to retaliate, however he has insisted it should be proportionate, thus ensuring the US would not be dragged into an all-out confrontation with Iran. After a week of total secrecy following a phone call between Bidenand Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu on 9 October, in which the discussions were largely centred on agreeing a range of mutually acceptable targets, Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying: 'We listen to the American government’s thoughts, but will make our final decisions based on Israel’s national security needs'. This statement was in response to a Washington Post story, highlighting thatNetanyahu had told Biden during the call that he would limit Isreal's retaliation to military sites. But while Biden has all along vehemently opposed targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, he suggested on 3 October that he was engaged in discussions related to striking Iran’s oil facilities, thereby sparking a 5% surge in oil prices. As a result, Biden scrambled immediately to make a screeching turnabout emphasizing: 'If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking about other alternatives than striking Iranian oil fields '. Given that the US presidential election is edging ever closer and with the polls indicating a tight racebetween Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, it is hardly surprising to see Biden working tirelessly to steer Netanyahu away from targeting Iran's oil facilities as this would doubtlessly fuel a dramatic surge in oil price, leading to a devastating blow to the US economy and therefore scupper Harris’s prospects of winning the elections. it is worth noting that Netanyahu's steadfast determination to fatally undermine all US-led attempts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or Lebanon has not only aimed to shore up his own political survival by preserving his right wing government - which would unravel in the event of a ceasefire - but more significantly todeprive Biden's democratic administration from any major diplomaticachievement in the Middle East, as opposed to Trump's spectacular breakthrough in normalising Isreal's relations with UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. And while it is abundantly clear that Netanyahu would prefer to see Trump in power,particularly given that Trump had - during his presidency - bent backwards to appease him, yet despite being confident that targeting Iran's oil facilities would boost Trump's campaign, Netanyahu would most likely refrain from such action, fearing accusations of meddling in US election. In a show of defiance Netanyahu has pressed ahead with his relentless campaign by storming Gaza and then invading Lebanon despite Biden's growing concern regarding the shockingly unjustifiable huge number of civilian casualties, especiallywoman and children, as well as the woefully inadequate amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Clearly Biden's refusal to put his money where his mouth is by condemning Netanyahu let alone threatening to halt weapon shipments - which is what the French president Emmanuel Macron has called for - has emboldened Netanyahu. Netanyahu's initial reaction to Iran's attack by forcefully stating: Iran had made a 'big mistake' and would 'pay for it' has implied a rapid response, however when it comes to targeting Iran, Netanyahu is acutely aware that he can ill-afford to defy Washington, given that Israel has become increasingly dependent, even in its own defence, on the US. In stark contrast to the grinding war of attrition in Gaza, where Netanyahu has failed to accomplish his central goals of completely dismantling Hamas and returning Israel's hostages home, in Lebanon he has undoubtedly been empowered by a series of unimaginable tactical successes culminating in the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah. Surely, this prompted Netanyahu to invade Lebanon, hoping to secure his new strategic goal of compelling Hezbollah to cease its ongoing year-long strikes on northern Israel, thus facilitating the return of thousands of displaced citizens to their homes. And amid the uncontainable sense of euphoria, some leading Israeli politicians have pushed hard for Netanyahu to exploit what they perceived as Iran's growing vulnerability - due to the weakening of Hezbollah and Hamas - by striking Iran's nuclear and oil facilities. Yet, such calls have increasingly abated in light of Hezbollah’s remarkably stiff resistance, which has derailed Israel's attempts to make any meaningful headway, while also striking deeper and more frequently into Israel - including targets such as a military base adjacent to Binyamina and even targeting Netanyahu's house in Caesarea. As expected, Netanyahu has adamantly refused on 17 October, to stop the war in Gaza or Lebanon even after killingYahya Sinwar Hamas's leader, who was the mastermind behind the 7 October attacks on Isreal. Even though Mohamed bin Salman [MBS] - Saudi Arabia's crown prince and de facto ruler - has left no doubt that he wouldprefer to see Trump - who unlike Biden had shielded him by suppressing a CIA report blaming him for ordering the killing ofJamal Khashoggi in 2018 - in power, but he was deeply disheartened when Trump shied away from taking decisive action against Iran - which Riyadh blamed - for an assault in 2019 by the Houthis on its oil facilities. As ever Trump cited the disastrous implications to global economy if Iran executes its enduring threat to target Riyadh's oil fields or the flow of Gulf oil through the strait of Hormuz, as the perfect excuse for inaction. Consequently, in the absence of such a wholehearted US support, MBS agreed in March 2023 - albeit grudgingly - to a Chinese-brokered rapprochement with Iran, aiming to not merely break free from the futile and unwinnable war that he waged on Yemen but more significantly to strip Iran of its formidable oil deterrence, therefore pave the way for the US and Israel to target Iran with impunity. In the eyes of MBS, Israel’s abrupt shiftfrom focusing solely on Hamas to taking on Hezbollah, including taking out its leader marked an excellent opportunity to spur Biden into not just giving Israel the green light but also to spearhead the targeting of Iran's nuclear and oil facilities. To this end Riyadh signalled on 26 September that it intends to ramp up its oil production in December in what it portrayed as an attempt to retain its share of the market but in reality it is a brazen move designed tonot only appease Biden, who has relentlessly called on MBS to curb oil prices in order to ease inflation in the US and hammer Russia's war machine in Ukraine, but also tounderline that there is sufficient oil in the market to offset any reduction in supply in the event of striking Iran. Even with all these extraordinary inducements Biden-Harris have remained disinterested, as it is clear that any misstep would fatally sabotage Harris's campaign. Iran meanwhile pulled no punches, bluntly warning Riyadh and Gulf states that opening their airspace or military basis to Israel would amount to an act of war, while also activating its oil deterrence by starkly threatening Riyadh that it could not guarantee the safety of its oil facilities. To avoid being plunged into a regional conflagration Riyadh and the Gulf states have informed Israel that they will not allow it to use their air space and also urged the US to push Israel to carefully calibrate its retaliation. Both Netanyahu and MBS want Hamas and Hezbollah eradicated. They both want Trump to win the elections, thereby set the stage for them to normalise their relations. But most crucially they strive to goad the US into confronting Iran. In practice, they both have faced an insurmountable hurdle: Neither Trump nor Biden or Harris have any appetite to be embroiled in such a daunting conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e50i83i92uZvE	2024-10-24T16:30:59-07:00	
Vaccines And The Length Of Our Lives – OpEd	The commercial imperative to extract money from human bodies is playing havoc with medical education, and the body of knowledge through which the medical professions operate. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the field of vaccines, and their place in determining the length of our lives. The History of Living Longer As a medical student, I was taught that the reason we in wealthy countries now live far longer than our forebears was improvements in living conditions, sanitation, and nutrition. We don’t walk through sewage and horse dung each day, eat fly-blown meat, drink water from below the nearest latrines, or sleep eight to a room on rancid bedding. We get beaten less often and have more leisure time. Antibiotics also helped but came after most of these gains had been achieved. Most vaccination came even later, mopping up some residual mortality in ‘vaccine-preventable diseases.’ This was all stated in a lecture hall of 300 medical students, with the relevant data to back it up, and accepted as fact. Because for wealthier countries it was, and is, undeniably true. I recently asked a small group of students the major reasons for improved life expectancy, and was told 'vaccination.' In a subsequent session, I showed some of the graphs laid out below. The students were shocked and asked where I obtained this information. It was actually fairly difficult to find. I remember searching 20 years ago and readily finding it on the web. In 2024, it took a lot of sifting through information explaining how vaccinations have apparently saved humanity, and how those repeating what I was taught as a student were a subversive element undermining the greater good, spreading misinformation or similar daft claims. We have certainly not progressed. This does not mean vaccines are not a great idea. Providing some immunity before an infection can mitigate much of its harm by giving the body a head start in fighting back. It just means their usefulness must be understood in context, as must their harms. Somewhat strangely, discussion of vaccines has become increasingly controversial within the medical establishment. It is as if an Inquisition has been imposed over the profession, seeking out anyone still prioritizing calm rational thought over a dogma dictated from above. However, if truth and calm discussion can form an anchor for policy, vaccination will be more effective. The charts shown here, from Australia, the United States, and England, reflect those of other wealthy countries. The same findings are reflected in various published papers. Facts are facts, even if they may with time become harder to find, buried under Big Search algorithms to keep us safe. They remain facts even if medical students are taught to believe alternate realities. Such false teaching, coupled with large financial incentives, drive their desire to ensure children be ‘fully vaccinated’ according to their country’s childhood schedule. They increasingly believe a lie, undeniable misinformation, that this is why most children in our countries now grow up without experiencing the death of a friend or sibling. Vaccines in Context The medical world calls these 'vaccine-preventable diseases' because companies sell vaccines that can prevent them. They are vaccine-preventable to a large extent, and vaccines do stop them from killing people. But in wealthy countries, truthfully, the numbers they save are very low. Vaccination probably had a major role in the elimination of smallpox. We cannot, of course, be absolutely sure, as there was no control group. Smallpox caused outbreaks that decimated populations isolated for thousands of years from the virus, such as Native Americans, where a vaccine would have made a massive difference. However, smallpox also had the hallmarks of a disease that might actually disappear through good public health education and improved living standards; it lacked an animal reservoir, required close contact with body fluids to spread, and was usually easy to recognize. It is probable that the vaccine considerably accelerated its decline, especially in poorer countries. Measles is similarly interesting. As the graphic shows, most decline was long before mass vaccination. Like whooping cough, mortality was probably partly reduced through the advent of oxygen therapy, but mainly people just appear to have become less susceptible to its complications. It could nonetheless be a devastating disease, which decimated isolated, immunologically-naïve populations in thePacific Islandsand elsewhere that had no history of contact, and still causes avoidable child death in low-income countries today. Measles deaths are often associated with micronutrient malnutrition, such as vitamin A deficiency, and fixing that would also address many other health risks. This used to be emphasized 30 years ago. However, the measles vaccine is also very effective at stopping measles deaths in susceptible populations. It has very little impact on mortality in wealthy countries where it mainly stops infection and annoying sickness, as few kids are so micronutrient-deficient to be susceptible to very severe diseases. It is so good at stopping actual infection that mandates for measles vaccines that some countries impose are more about authoritarianism than public health. If you don’t want your child to risk measles and decide that vaccination is a lesser risk, you can have your child vaccinated. Your child is now protected from those who are unvaccinated, so there should be no interest in mandating it for them. Rational free people could live with that. Hepatitis B and HPV vaccination (for Human Papilloma Virus) are two further curiosities. We schedule Hep B vaccination on the first day of life, even though it is mainly spread in Western countries through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. If the parents are not infected (and all mothers are screened), then there is not really a risk until the late teenage years, when the person can make their own informed choice. For a child born in a country with 30% Hepatitis B positivity rates and poor healthcare, the risk-benefit calculation may produce a different result. Dying of liver failure or liver cancer is not pleasant. The HPV vaccine, intended to prevent cervical cancer, has a complicated picture. It will have limited mortality impact in Western countries where cervical cancer mortality has already declined through regular screening. Elsewhere the situation is very different, with over300,000women dying annually from this agonizing disease, mostly in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa where only about12% are screened. This is not through choice but because screening is poorly accessible. As development of cancer can take about 20 years after HPV infection, we must also rely on (reasonable) assumptions about causality when calculating benefits. So, the equation clearly varies between women. Calculating risk versus benefit in order to ensure clear informed consent (or even medical ethical competency) would require consideration of age, behavior, access to screening, and adverse event rates. To know adverse event rates, a comparison would logically be necessary between the vaccine and something neutral like saline (rather than other vaccine constituents). Because this is still awaited, women should of course be informed of this data gap. Therefore, a blanket policy on HPV vaccination would be illogical. The story of diphtheria suggests that medical management may have had a major role in its decline. The decline coincided with the introduction of antibody therapy (anti-toxin), and later decline with the toxoid vaccine. However, it also coincided with the decline of other respiratory diseases of childhood that did not have such interventions. So, we simply cannot be sure. Tetanus toxoid may also have had an impact, especially for people at higher risk, such as plumbers and farmers. However, accountants no longer navigate dung-paved streets on the way to the office and this general cleaning up of the environment will have driven much of the change. For business reasons that are slightly unclear, boosters are available only combined with diphtheria and pertussis vaccines in many Western countries, which adds nothing to an adult’s benefit but adds to their risk. It’s hard to claim safety and benefit are the main drivers in the face of such an anomaly. Knowing What We Don’t Know All vaccines also have adverse effects. While not discussed here, they are real and I know people whose health was wrecked by vaccination. Assessment of risk is difficult as no childhood vaccines on the US schedule have been through a true placebo-controlled trial – they are usually compared against the rest of the contents of the vial (chemicals such as adjuvants and preservatives but lacking the antigen or inactivated virus – a mixture that may be the cause of most of the side effects) or against another vaccine. By doing this, they can be shown to be no worse than the comparator, which would be fine if we actually had decent placebo-controlled trials of the comparators. Most doctors who prescribe vaccines almost certainly don’t know this. (There is agood, evidence-based explanationof this issue which is well worth reading). Most doctors probably also pay little attention to the lack of trials determining the effect of giving dozens of doses of immune-stimulating adjuvants and preservatives, including aluminum salts, to growing children across their formative years. It is likely to be relatively harmless to many children, but harmful to some, as biology tends to work that way. However, if the disease that it addresses is hardly ever severe, then that ‘some’ can become very significant. Each ‘some’ is a child whose parents are trying to do the right thing, and trusting the medical establishment that this is indeed being done. None of this would be new to a lot of people, as interest in vaccines and their harms and benefits is growing. However, most doctors performing vaccinations are probably unaware of much of the above, especially those graduating in the past couple of decades. If they are aware, they will likely be scared to discuss it as this would risk being labeled a 'vaccine denier' or similarly childish term, or seen as promoting 'vaccine hesitancy.' Vaccine hesitancy is what we once referred to as informed consent (or thinking before doing). After World War Two, we decided that informed consent was essential for ethical medicine. Now, the World Health Organization considers such independent thought a particularlydangerous threatto their interests and those of their sponsors. Many recently trained doctors would consider the lecture I attended 40 years ago a public health risk, and the facts we were shown ‘misinformation.’ They will, at least in the US, also graduate with massive debt and be quite dependent onthe subsidiesthey can receive from medical insurers, which includeoffering or givingvaccinations. This is why they can be so dismissive of intelligent people who spend time reading up on, and questioning, such things. They are not being aggressive or intentionally batting for Big Pharma; they are just so indoctrinated in the selling of these health commodities, and so financially and professionally dependent on this being the best course, that they are unable to articulate an independent, rational, evidence-based stance. Navigating a Rational Path To understand the vaccination issue, the public needs to understand that the medical and public health professions have lost their ability to reason. They are experts in repeating what they were taught, but not in deciphering reality. There are also fanatics and dogmatic people on the other side of the vaccine divide that can see the harms, but not the good. They downplay a few hundred thousand cervical cancer deaths per year, and have not witnessed the gut-wrenching sight of a baby dying of tetanus in a low-income country with no ability to address her pain. They have not had to send a rabies sufferer home to die because there is simply nothing the local medical system can do for them once they are symptomatic. On vaccination policy, the public mostly needs to go it alone. Understand there are real risks and real benefits, like any pharmaceutical. Understand that the main reason why we don’t die from many of the infectious diseases that we used to has little to do with vaccination. Listen to a doctor, then ask them some pointed questions to ascertain whether they are looking at your child in context and weighing both sides or simply reciting a script. When the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, vaccines make sense. They are a foolish idea when the opposite applies. It’s difficult to navigate the information out there, but the public must do so until the medical establishment frees itself from the shackles of its sponsors and catches up. Everyone should be hesitant to have stuff injected into them for commercial profit. We should hesitate more when the person injecting it is also rewarded for their compliance. Doctors should be hesitant about injecting chemicals and metal salts into anyone unless they have strong expectations of net benefit. With vaccines, as with antibiotics and almost any other pharmaceutical, sometimes they will have and sometimes they won’t. Obviously, governments should not be mandating the injection of commercial chemicals as a requirement to participate in society – that would be ridiculous. A State can never make such individual cost-benefit assessments, and in a democracy, we certainly don’t pay the government to own and direct our bodies. This is all so obvious, and inline with conventional evidence-based practice, that you really wonder what all the fuss is about.

Hamas Without Sinwar: A Setback Or A Catalyst? – OpEd	Ever since the October 7 attack last year, Israeli intelligence claimed that Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s military leader, was hiding deep within Gaza’s complex underground tunnels, using Israeli hostages as a strategic shield. They alleged that he was using these hostages as a deterrent to complicate any rescue attempt or targeted strike. Sinwar’s elusiveness became almost mythic. Yet, his death has proven that narrative wrong. Contrary to prior assessments, Sinwar wasn’t hiding underground. Instead, Israeli forces found him above ground, dressed in military attire, in the rubble of a building. He was actively participating on the battlefield, not cowering in tunnels. This revelation has generated some prickly questions about the credibility of Israel’s intelligence agencies. How much does Israel truly know about the remaining hostages’ whereabouts? This question will intensify the pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to present a viable strategy for their rescue. Sinwar’s death has also prompted deeper concerns. For instance, can Israel effectively monitor and control the situation in Gaza, especially when its intelligence regarding key figures like Sinwar appears flawed? Indeed, with Sinwar’s killing, new uncertainties have emerged about the fate of the hostages, the leadership of Hamas, and the broader trajectory of this protracted conflict. Revolutionary movements often revolve around their charismatic leaders, whether in the shadows or out in the open. The reality is that Hamas has now lost one of its key figures. But this isn’t the first time Hamas has faced such a blow. The organization has a long history of surviving and recalibrating after losing its leaders. The list is not short: Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Abdel Aziz el-Rantisi, and, more recently, Ismail Haniyeh. These figures have spanned the spiritual, political, and military realms. Yet, Sinwar’s death carries unique weight, not just because of his position, but due to his personal trajectory. He wasn’t just a figurehead within a militant group. He was a hardliner, even by Hamas’ standards. He also carried unique clout, largely because of his deep ties to Hamas’s military wing, having served as the head of its counterintelligence. What set Sinwar apart from other leaders, many of whom operated in exile, was his physical presence in Gaza. While some in the upper echelons of Hamas led from afar, Sinwar remained entrenched in the heart of the besieged Strip. His leadership style reflected the intractable realities of life under siege, making him a figure of both fear and respect within the organization. Replacing a leader in Hamas is not as simple as swapping one face for another. Each time a leader is killed, the spiritual, political, and military forces within the group must realign. What’s different now, however, is the fluid nature of the struggle itself. For nearly 80 years, Palestinians have remained trapped in a conflict that defies political or diplomatic resolution. Sinwar, like others before him, envisioned a way forward. With his death, Hamas faces a critical crossroads. The world is changing, and Hamas must change with it or risk becoming irrelevant. New leaders will undoubtedly rise. To be successful, they’ll need to align their strategies to a rapidly shifting global and regional landscape. Israel’s current military campaign appears aimed at dismantling the leadership of groups like Hamas, a reflection of its long-standing struggle to resolve the Palestinian question. The devastation of Gaza and the suffering of its people speak to the brutal nature of this conflict. In many ways, the region has been caught in a vicious cycle of violence, where the killing of a leader like Sinwar doesn’t quell the resistance but adds fuel to the fire. The echoes of past conflicts—like those in Lebanon—continue to shape this grim and unresolved narrative as war appears only to breed more war. Yet, despite these seemingly decisive blows, Hamas endures. Each fallen leader’s story becomes legend, inspiring a new generation that is often more militant, more extreme, and even harder to negotiate with. Sinwar’s demise does not signal the end of Hamas at all. Sure, it will temporarily reduce the immediate threat, offering Israel a brief sense of tactical respite. But it is unlikely to end the war or halt the bloodshed in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed 40,000. And it certainly doesn’t suggest that peace, or a two-state solution, is suddenly on the horizon. The hard truth remains: the occupation persists, and the establishment of a Palestinian state is as distant a dream as ever.

MEPs Seek Solutions On Russia’s Shadow Oil Tankers	By Nathan Canas (EurActiv) -- The European Parliament debated on Wednesday evening (23 October) the necessary actions to address the issue of Russia exporting oil using 'shadow tankers' to circumvent EU sanctions and continue to supply it to third countries. Shadow tankers are often old vessels with unclear ownership, which typically sail underthe flags of countrieswith quality controls that are considered poor.These vessels also lack satellite tracking, and operate without insurance, posing a major ecological threat. Until now, these vessels had mainly been used to transport Iranian and Venezuelan goods under sanctions and occasionally for drug trafficking.However, this changed following EU sanctions on Russia. The EU halted 90% of its oil imports from Russiain December 2022and established, alongside the G7 countries, a price ceiling of US$60a barrel to limit Moscow's profits. According toa studyby S&P Global, around 591 of these shadow tankers are in operation, and responsible for transporting up to 70% of Russian oil by sea. Ecological bombs While the number of shadow tankers continues to rise, they also represent a major environmental risk. Many of these ageing vessels lackregistrationwith the AIS tracking system, heightening the threat of maritime collisions. During the Parliament debate on Wednesday, Latvian MEP Sandra Kalniete (EPP) described them as 'ecological time bombs that threaten the world's waters with oil spills.' One EU sea is particularly threatened: the Baltic Sea. Already considered one ofthe most polluted seasin the world, 50% of Russian oil exports transit through it. For Swedish MEP Isabella Lövin (Greens/EFA), 'We need to stop importing fossil fuels, not just for the Baltic, but also for Ukraine and for peace.' '[We should] refuse access to the Baltic Sea to all these ships,' recommended for its part Swedish MEP Jonas Sjöstedt (The Left). According toAllianz, these shadow ships were involved in at least 50 accidents at sea, complicating compensation efforts due to their lack of insurance. Dutch MEP Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy (Renew) pointed out, 'European taxpayers will ultimately have to pay the bill once the disaster is a reality.' The European institutions, together with the Member States, have joined the UK government's call to the relevant stakeholders to 'adhere to their relevant obligations and support the prevention, detection and reporting of 'shadow fleet' activities', reads apolicy paperpublished on 17 October. A difficult equation The EU cannot simply ban these ships from its waters, the European Commission explained in its Maywritten responseto MEPs Pernille Weiss (PPE) and Niels Fuglsang (S&D) who were asking questions about Russian shadow fleet in Union waters. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ships are granted the right of innocent passage, allowing them to 'navigate freely in territorial seas.' 'Preventing shadow fleet vessels from entering territorial waters or exclusive economic zones faces significant challenges,' wrote current Commissioner for financial services and stability Mairead McGuinness. Another challenge concerns non-EU countries, which continue to demand Russian oil and see the Ukrainian conflict as a European concern. On this point, Hungarian MEP András László (PfE) declared that 'the idea of fighting against an energy giant was madness,' and added that 'apart from the Western countries, no others have joined the sanctions.' A resolution on this will be put to a vote of MEPs during the 13-14 November plenary session in Brussels.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e50P4yrQaDPjO	2024-10-24T16:17:04-07:00	
Rent Control Is Not A Solution: It’s A Recipe For Exacerbating Th...	Utah is an increasingly costly place to live. It’s ranked thethird most expensivestate to buy a home. A staggering80% of Utahnsbelieve that housing prices are too high, and the complaint isn’t limited to homebuyers. Rental rates have also surged dramatically, jumping 34% to 41% inSalt Lake Countysince 2018. Some politicians argue that high housing costs are driven by sellers’ and landlords’ greed, but the real reasons behind high prices are far more complex.Inflation,regulatory barriersthat limit the supply of affordable housing andpopulation growthhave inflated costs, putting immense pressure on renters and property owners.High energy prices,labor shortagesandsupply chain issueshave compounded the challenges. In other words, the root of the problem lies in supply and demand, yet many of the proposed solutions ignore that basic economic principle. The worst policy response thus far has already been proven to fail for eons: rent control. President Joe Bidenproposed a federal versionof rent control earlier this year. In addition, his Department of Justice isattemptingto enact backdoor rent control by challenging algorithmic pricing software that assists landlords in determining the market price at which to list their property. After accepting nomination for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris similarlyembraced rent controlandpledgedto 'take on corporate landlords.' While rent control may seem like immediate relief for struggling renters, it backfires by chilling developers’ incentives to build new housing and landlords to maintain existing properties. The supply of rental units falls, making housing even scarcer while driving up prices in the long term. In areas where rent control has been implemented, such asNew York CityandSan Francisco, landlords often respond by pulling units from the market or converting them into condominiums, further shrinking the rental supply. It is not a solution—it’s a recipe for exacerbating the problem. Rent controls force rental rates below market-clearing levels and lead to excess demand for apartments. Landlords can react by charging extra for parking, furnishings and even keys. Since not enough units are available, landlords are freer to discriminate in favor of tenants they prefer (no pets, no children, no students). Renters are forced to find places to live outside rent-controlled areas, lengthening commutes. Vacancy rates in rent-controlled apartments shrink because favored tenants understandably are reluctant to move out. None of the adverse consequences of rent controls are 'unintended' or 'unexpected;' they are predictable and confirmed by evidence. The only workable solution is to increase the supply of new homes and apartments. In fact, Utah’s rental market has already begun showing signs of improvement, thanks to local leaders’ support for new construction. AsDejan Eskic, a housing analyst at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah, noted, 'There are now more apartments available than people looking for apartments.' As a result, asking rents have dropped by around 2.5% to 3.5% since January, and many landlords are now offering economic incentives to attract tenants. That’s good news. However, if the Biden administration implements rent controls, that progress could be undone, discouraging further construction and creating disincentives for owners to maintain or improve their properties. Photographs of rent-controlled areas of New York City look like bombed German cities during World War II. Rather than imposing federal rent caps, which would only aggravate the situation, policymakers should focus on solutions that have already been proven to workin places like Argentina—removing rent controls, building more housing, cutting red tape, and making it easier to become a landlord. Let housing markets work for Utah, not against Utahns.

Thousands Of North Korean Troops Set To Deploy Alongside Russian ...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. A New Enemy at the Gates: The North Korean Military on the Ground in Europe Further evidence has emerged that North Korea’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has extended beyond ammunition transfers and diplomatic support, and now involves North Korean troops in Europe. On October 21,South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeolparticipated in a telephone conversation at the request of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The two leaders exchanged critical intelligence on North Korean combat formations within the Russian military and the formations’ potential roles in the war. South Korea also summoned Georgy Zinoviev, Russia’s ambassador to Seoul, to protest the troubling new ties between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea’sdemandthat North Korea immediately withdraw its troops underscored the urgency of the situation. General Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR), revealed that a division-size North Korean force of approximately 11,000 servicemen is currently training in Russia to prepare for deployment in Ukraine. Of these personnel, a regiment-size unit of 2,600 troops isreportedly soon heading to the Russian region of Kursk. Intelligence from South Korea, which aligns with reports from Ukraine, detected the presence oftraining facilities in Russiacapable of accommodating up to 12,000 North Korean servicemen. South Korean officials also disclosed that Pyongyang has dispatched a 1,500-person special forces detachment to Russia, further highlighting the scale of North Korea’s commitment. North Korea’s involvement has given a significant boost to Russia’s effort in Ukraine. Someintelligence assessmentshave concluded that half of the three million artillery shells the Russian military has used yearly in Ukraine have come from Pyongyang. Furthermore, a technical analysis of a North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missile recently shot down in Ukraine has revealed that Pyongyang’s munition uses components from Western systems. In return for this support, Moscow has rewarded Pyongyang with technical assistance for its own weapons systems. Cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a dangeroustrend that this report will continue to monitor. 2. Battlefield Assessment Russian forces continued offensive efforts on the Kharkiv front, where they launched waves of attacks to capture the critical hub ofVovchansk. Elite Russian combat formations, including detachments from the 1st Guards Tank Army and special operations units from the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU), participated in the fighting. Kupiansk has also seen heavy combat that has increased pressure on Ukraine. Furthermore, declassified intelligence from the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence revealed that Russian combat formations have reachedthe Oskil River. The September 25, 2024,editionof this report highlighted how the Oskil could provide the Russian General Staff with a natural barrier to stabilize the front and cement its territorial gains. Additionally, the Russian military intensified offensive combat action around the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar. Pokrovsk and Toretsk also remain under heavy pressure, withUkrainian defensiveswavering there. Visual evidence shows that the Ukrainian military has combat-deployed sub-units of the38th Marine Brigadeto the Pokrovsk front. Meanwhile, the 36th Ukrainian Marine Brigade continued to operate in the Russian region of Kursk. Open-source intelligence suggests that the Ukrainian military has fielded Abrams main battle tanks, its principal high-end Western armor, as well as Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in itsKursk campaign. After bolstering its force-on-force and force-to-terrain ratios in Kursk, the Russian military has been on a counteroffensive footing for several weeks. Unfortunately, evidence is mounting that Russia’s 155th Marine Brigade, infamous for conducting massacres in the Ukrainian cities of Bucha and Irpin in the early stages of the war, has again committed war crimes, killing several Ukrainianprisoners of war(POWs) in Kursk. The Ukrainian military continued to conduct long-range strikes to attempt to gain an asymmetric advantage in the face of Russia’s conventional superiority on land. Last week, Ukraine’s drones hammered the Russian state-owned Sverdlov plant, one ofRussia’s largest manufacturers of military explosives, near Nizhny Novgorod over 450 miles inside Russia. Kyiv’s drone and missile forces also struck the Lipetsk-2 military airport, located 240 miles from the Ukrainian front. TheUkrainian General Staffreported that the salvo targeted ammunition depots and fuel storage centers that supply Russia’s Su-35 fighters, MiG-31 interceptors, and Su-34 fighter-bombers. Ukraine also used American-provided High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to pound a Russianmilitary trainingground on the southern front.

Iran, Israel Have Formidable Militaries With Different Strengths ...	As tensions between Israel and the Iranian government escalate, the conflict is moving beyond mere asymmetric warfare toward direct strikes on each other’s soil. This new phase of hostilities raises concerns about the military capabilities of both countries, as analysts and experts assess the strengths and weaknesses of their armed forces. To understand the full scope of the potential confrontation, it is essential to recognize that any war between these two nations would not only devastate them, but could also draw in other regional and global players, including state and non-state actors. The strategic importance of both Israel and Iran makes this conflict a potential trigger for wider regional instability. Military capabilities can be analyzed through several categories that reveal the operational readiness and strategic power of a nation. These categories provide a framework to evaluate how Israel and Iran compare. A country’s defense budget serves as a crucial indicator of its military strength and priorities. It reflects the resources dedicated to developing and maintaining military assets, such as personnel, technology and weapons systems. Israel’s defense budget is significantly larger than Iran’s, bolstered by substantial US military aid. Israel’s annual defensespendingis currently $23.4 billion, with an additional $3.18 billion annually provided by the US as part of a decade-long agreement. This financial backing enables Israel to procure advanced weapons systems, such as the Iron Dome and F-35 stealth fighters, meaning it is most likely the technologically superior force. Iran spends considerably less due to international sanctions and economic constraints. Its 2023 defense spending wasreportedto be $10.3 billion, although it might be higher due to undisclosed funds used for its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran compensates for its lower budget by relying on asymmetric tactics, such as using proxies and deploying missile forces capable of striking its regional adversaries. Manpower is a vital component of military strength. In terms of active personnel, Israelmaintainsabout 170,000 soldiers in its defense forces, with a reserve force that can quickly be mobilized, bringing the total potential military manpower to about 465,000. The Israeli military is highly trained, with mandatory military service ensuring a constant supply of well-prepared soldiers. However, Iran’s available manpower significantly surpasses Israel’s. It has an estimated 587,000 active personnel across its regular army, IRGC and paramilitary forces. The IRGC, a powerful institution within Iran, also oversees the country’s regional proxy forces, allowing it to extend its military reach beyond its borders. In terms of force readiness, however, both countries are generally considered trained and equipped due to continuous engagements and modern training programs. When it comes to weapons systems, Israel appears to enjoy a technological edge, particularly in terms of air power. It possesses 339 combat aircraft, including F-35s and F-16s, alongside various advanced drones, allowing it to maintain air superiority in the region. Israel also has cutting-edge missile defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow, which can intercept short- and medium-range missiles. Its logistical network is robust, ensuring rapid mobility and deployment of forces. Irancompensatesfor its lack of air superiority with a vast arsenal of ballistic missiles, including the Shahab-3 and Fateh-110, which are capable of reaching targets across the Middle East. Iran also has a growing drone capability and relies heavily on its ability to deploy asymmetric warfare tactics. Its logistical capabilities, while not as advanced as Israel’s, are boosted by its network of regional proxies, particularly in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. Geographically, Iran has a strategic advantage due to its location along the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway through which a significant portion of the world’s oil supply passes. In the event of conflict, Iran could threaten or disrupt global oil supplies by blocking or attacking ships in this region. Israel, on the other hand, has a smaller geographical footprint, although its proximity to other countries allows it to rapidly project military power in the Middle East. One of the key advantages for Iran is its ability to leverage regional proxies. Israel, meanwhile, benefits from its close alliances with the US, which guarantees it superior military technology and intelligence support. When it comes to technical sophistication, Israel’s military is considered to be one of the most advanced in the world. Its intelligence services, cyber capabilities and precision-guided weaponry give it a qualitative edge in modern warfare. It is also regarded as one of the globe’s top countries in terms of missile defense technology, electronic warfare and intelligence gathering, supported by satellite technology. Meanwhile, Iran, although not on par with Israel’s advanced technologies, has made significant strides in developing its own indigenous defense technologies. Iran’s cyberwarfare capabilities are growing and its missile technology is considered among the most advanced in the region. While lacking the sophistication of Israel’s military, Iran compensates with its sheer number of missiles and a capacity to disrupt its enemies through unconventional warfare. Lastly, alliances and partnerships play a critical role in shaping military capabilities. Iran’s primary ally, Russia, has for yearsprovidedit with military equipment and political support. But Moscow’s involvement in Ukraine has somewhat constrained its ability to focus on the Middle East. Tehran also maintains ties with China, although this relationship appears less focused on military support. Israel, on the other hand, enjoys an unparalleled alliance with the US, which provides it with both military hardware and political backing. In the event of a conflict, American support for Israel could tip the balance in its favor, as seen in previous wars. In conclusion, while a full-scale war between Israel and Iran would be devastating for these two countries and the broader region, their military capabilities reveal different strengths and weaknesses. Both remain formidable in their own right, but their strategies and military doctrines reflect very different approaches to warfare.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e52ZUeETBuXim	2024-10-24T16:06:43-07:00	
What Will The Final Document Of The Synod On Synodality Be Like? ...	By Andrea Gagliarducci A year ago, at the end of the Synod on Synodality’s first general assembly, electronic versions of a draft of the confidential summary report were circulated among the media and others, as inevitably happens, in the days leading up to the delegates’ last amendments and final vote. This year, apparently to discourage such leaks, synod organizers only provided participants with hard copies of the draft report, which aren’t as easily disseminated. The irony is that there may not be much to share. Internally and externally over the past several weeks, the assembly has come under intense pressure to change the Church’s governing structures and even some of its basic doctrines. Theologian Myriam Wijlens, a synod consultant, emphasized at an Oct. 23 press briefing that Pope Francis has called for 'reconfiguring the Church in a synodal way.' Doing so would require changes to canon law to, for example, make parish or diocesan councils mandatory. But bigger changes, such as opening the diaconate to women or allowing exceptions to priestly celibacy, to cite two issues that were promoted publicly this month, appear off the table. According to sources who have spoken to CNA, what’s left is a draft report that is generating disappointment in progressive quarters but very little buzz. Titled 'Communion, Mission, and Participation,' it’s a short document — 152 paragraphs, for the time being, covering about 47 pages. According to synod sources, it is divided into five parts. The first part deals with the shared understanding of synodality and its theological principles. The second concerns what is called a 'relational conversion.' The third part speaks of ecclesial discernment, decision-making processes, the culture of transparency, accountability, and evaluation. The fourth part seeks to understand how to cultivate the exchange of gifts in new ways. Finally, the fifth part speaks of formation in and for missionary synodality. The synod’s final document, one delegate told CNA, appears to be strongly borrowed from the document on synodality that the International Theological Commission published in 2018, titled 'Synodality in the Life and Mission of the Church.' After reviewing it the synod delegates can propose amendments, which the assembly will discuss and vote on this Saturday. Two-thirds of the assembly must approve a paragraph for it to be retained. In the past, if a paragraph did not reach even two-thirds, it would not be published. It was said that it did not represent synodal communion. Pope Francis has instead wanted each paragraph of the final document to be published and that votes for or against be indicated together with the paragraph. Beyond the talks about healthy decentrality, the draft document addresses how this decentralization should be addressed. In particular, there is a paragraph that says that in a synodal Church, the decision-making competence of the bishop and of the bishop of Rome is 'inalienable' while proposing some good practices to make the diocesan and parish council representative of all the people of God, women included. Some describe the document as interlocutory rather than definitive. One bishop observed that 'the document allows everyone to manage things as they wish.' But, he added, showing some disappointment, 'So what were we discussing?' If these are the results of two synodal stages in Rome and a three-year journey of dialogue and listening before that, it’s clear that many will be disappointed. There are no revolutions, but rather a call for a change of mentality in the Church grounded in the idea that synodality has always been present in the Church. This will be the starting point for Saturday’s concluding session. After the publication of the final document we will have to wait for Pope Francis to act. The Holy Father could decide to adopt the final document in full as a postsynodal exhortation or he could draft a postsynodal exhortation himself, either before or after the various study groups of experts deliver their final reports in May. In the end, everything depends on the pope.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e591siAvHAKPk	2024-10-24T16:02:15-07:00	
Why Is Prehistory Inspiring So Many Artists? – Analysis	What draws us to such a distant and long-gone time? A fruitful relationship has always existed between prehistory (a scientific discipline constantly refreshed by new discoveries) and the visual artists who interpret it. Prehistory is a modern idea. The word was 'coined' only in the 1830s. Before the 19th century, we didn't know much about dinosaurs or cavemen, and fossils remained a scientific curiosity. When French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon published his notoriousHistoire naturelle(1749–1788), suggesting that nature had a history and proposing the first reproduction theory, the faculty of theology at the Sorbonne University in France condemned it and threatened him with repercussions. He eventually had to publish a retraction. Similarly, when Charles Darwin (1809–1882) published hisOn the Origin of Species(1859), his compatriots in the United Kingdom and Europe still believed that God made man 'in his own image,' as stated in the Bible (Genesis 1:27). Anyone claiming that all animals came from the same origin, and apes were somehow our distant cousins, was considered a fool or a heretic. Then the first caves were excavated revealing extensive and intricate artwork on their walls. In 1879, archeologist Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola explored a new cave in Altamira, northern Spain, and brought his young daughter, Maria, with him. She spotted vivid depictions of bison and masterfully painted scenes on the cave's ceiling. These cave paintings were initially dismissed as forgeries, as scholars of the time, with the positivist mindset,could not imagine that people from the Paleolithic were sophisticated enoughto produce such complex artworks. By the early 20th century, however, as archaeologists uncovered more ancient skeletons, bones, fossils, and early human art in caves and other sites, their discoveries started to raise curiosity beyond the scientific community. Writers, intellectuals, and the public were captivated by these glimpses into our distant past. Artists were intrigued, sometimes amazed by the mind-blowing quality of parietal art, indecipherable, complex abstract shapes and objects, and what was perceived as scenes depicting animals and humans in rituals or sacrifices. The drawings, paintings, and etchings that endlessly decorated the walls, ceilings, and floors of caves in subtle colors were often mesmerizing. Picasso was particularly inspired by various prehistoric elements, as the 2023 exhibitionNo Past in Art: How Prehistory Inspired Picasso's Workat the Musée de l'Homme in Paris showed. Gauguin, Cézanne, and later the symbolists and primitivists, also dedicated various paintings and sculptures to what they perceived as representations of our origins, rituals, and myths. Prehistory has never stopped inspiring artists since then, captivating the most important modern art figures like Jean Arp, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee, Joan Miró; Joseph Beuys, Louise Bourgeois, Jean Dubuffet, Marguerite Duras, Barbara Hepworth, Yves Klein, and Robert Smithson. It continues to be an inspiration among our contemporaries, including Dove Allouche, Miquel Barceló, Tacita Dean, Marguerite Humeau, Pierre Huyghe, and Giuseppe Penone, to name just a few, whose works were showcased during the 2019 exhibition,Préhistoire, une énigme moderne(Prehistory, a Modern Enigma). This landmark exhibition, which took place at the Pompidou Center in Paris, inspired me and initiated my interest in prehistory. It is not the first museum show dedicated to the topic: fossils, artifacts, and artworks discovered in caves, as well as tools, ornaments, and sculptures made from natural rocks, have been exhibited in major art institutions since the end of the 19th century. Most of these exhibitions have already created fruitful dialogues between the past and present and parietal art and its representation by contemporary artists. When it opened its Gallery of Comparative Anatomy and Paleontology in 1898, the National Museum of Natural History in Paris commissioned the sculptor Emmanuel Frémiet and the painter Fernand Cormon to create a vast decorative program.Prehistoric Rock Pictures in Europe and Africaat the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA, New York, 1937) showed monumental surveys of cave paintings with a selection of contemporary works by Miró, Klee, and Ernst, among others, in echo. 'That an institution devoted to the most recent in the art should concern itself with the most ancient may seem something of a paradox,' MoMA's founding director Alfred H. Barr Jr. wrote in his preface to the exhibition catalogue.'Yet, for Barr, this past had already influenced modern art, and could potentially offer museum visitors a prehistoric pedigree for it,'statesthe MoMA website. Another major exhibition,40,000 Years of Modern Art, organized by Herbert Read and Roland Penrose at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1948, mixed prehistory and non-Western art with surrealist, expressionist, and abstract works. But there is a major problem, particularly, concerning the so-called 'primitive art,'—a highly contested term now. The clichés and stereotypes that this notion implies were also abundant in the early 'scientific' literature dedicated to our ancestors. The first paleontologists were poisoned by plain racist prejudices,explainspaleo artist and authorMark P. Wittonin his 2020 blog. George Cuvier (1769–1832), the father of vertebrate paleontology whose famous taxonomy incorporated both fossils and living species, 'viewed whites as the pinnacle of creation, but Blacks as ugly, barbaric persons of monkey-like appearance,' writes Witton. 'His work on dividing humans into 'scientifically validated' races was instrumental in later attempts at biological justifications of racism.' In the United States, the influential president of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857–1935) was a supporter of Hitler. He exploited his research to promote racist and eugenicist ideas,points outWitton. Osborn commissioned one of the earliest depictions of prehistoric life, Charles Knight's mural 'Neanderthal Flintworkers' (1924), hung in AMNH's Hall of the Age of Man. Many of Osborn's contemporaries, including Margaret Mead, weretroubled by the racist character of the imagery. The faces and looks of the Neanderthal men and women depicted in this iconic—though controversial and scientifically incorrect work—were inspired by features of non-white peoples, instead of being deduced from their bones. A Eurocentric mindset has continued to characterize the collective representation of prehistory until recently, sometimes reducing it to a more subtle form of 'primitive art.' In 1984, MoMA dedicated a survey exhibition to'Primitivism' in 20th Century Art. MoMA bragged about being the first institution to 'juxtapose modern and tribal objects in the light of informed art history.' But the exhibition omitted dates of the Indigenous works and explanations of their functions, as art historian Thomas McEvilly remarked in hisArtforum review of the show. He criticizedPrimitivism in 20th Century Artas expressing 'Western egotism still as unbridled as in the centuries of colonialism and souvenirism.' Since then, the museum has made itsmea culpa, addressing thecontroversyon its website. The Pompidou exhibition's three curators, Cécile Debray, Rémi Labrusse, and Maria Stavrinaki,write on the museum websitethatPrimitivism in the 20th Century Artdid not include prehistory 'which, in fact, is fundamentally different from it. For the modern Western world, the 'primitive' is generally rooted in specific cultures, usually described as exotic; the question of temporality is secondary to its geographical and cultural otherness. Prehistory, on the other hand, is seen above all as an indefinitely stretched time span, and thus largely indecipherable (whether in terms of nature or the first human cultures).' Labrussededicated a book to this paradoxical situation. 'Prehistory is precisely what ispre, meaningout ofhistory,' he told me in an interview in October 2024. It 'radically overturned our dream of mastering linear time, as 19th-century historicism chose to formulate it.' Here lies the paradox that attracts so many artists to prehistory, according to Labrusse: 'Because it is largely indecipherable (whether in terms of nature or the first human cultures), it remains fascinating.' FromPrehistory, a Modern Enigma, I remember the scenography. Tall walls, obscure corridors, grandiose frescos, and a prehistoric cave reconstituted at the center of it. In this spectacular setting, amid fossils, Cro-Magnon skulls, tools, and Paleolithic carvings, there were more than 300 works of art by modern and contemporary artists. Plus elements of popular culture: surveys of archaeological excavations, advertisements, and extracts from books (The Quest for Fire, a hugely popular Belgian 1911 fantasy novel) and cult films such asThe Lost World(1925),King Kong(1933), or2001: A Space Odyssey(1968). This undertone in the exhibitions shows what the curators of the Pompidou exhibitiondescribeas the 'invention of the concept of prehistory.' How artists and society have succumbed to the appeal of origins in the modern era, 'yielding to a fantasized vision of what came before history.' The exhibition opened with Odilon Redon and Paul Cézanne, at the turn of the 20th century. Cézanne was an amateur student of geology and paleontology. He visited prehistoric caves and painted the rocks on the Mediterranean coast with hisclose friendAntoine-Fortuné Marion (1846–1900), who later became a noted geologist and paleontologist. The show also exposed the Venus of Lespugue, the famous prehistoric ivory statuette,dated around 23,000 years ago, which inspired Picasso and Giacometti (both owned plaster casts of it). She stands there, in an exhibition room at the Musée de l'Homme, surrounded by bronzes from Matisse, Miró, and other modern artists who were equally fascinated by her and other statues from that time. 'Préhistoire, une énigme moderne' brilliantly demonstrated how prehistory inspired modernity, an artistic movement that was, paradoxically, about the future. Photos of the 1889 Paris World's Fair show how the Eiffel Tower and various cutting-edge technologies were exhibited alongside Neanderthal skeletons. A Max Ernst painting of 'petrified forests, glacialized landscapes, and sedimented earth,' created after World War I, raised questions about whether these were depictions 'from after humanity, or before it?' as modernism developed toward 'a prehistoric vision of time before humankind,' according to a 2019 New York Timesarticle. This feeling got stronger with the tragedies of World War II when many intellectuals and artists turned their back on the notion of progress, digging in reverse into the beginning of life, extinct species, the first hominids, the lost cultures of the Paleolithic era, and the Neolithic revolution to grapple with the possibility of extinction, of earth without humankind. 'Nourished by archaeological discoveries, but far from simply reflecting on them,... prehistory...[functioning] as a powerful machine for stirring up time,'writethe curators. 'This time machine constantly shapes the mental boundaries of modernity and provides concrete models for all sorts of experiments.' The exhibition also explores the mysteries of shaped rocks and tools, an intimate relationship to animals, ecological issues, and apocalyptic wonder in chronological and thematic parcourse. These themes are part of the collective representation, the idea of what prehistory is and how the inspired artists, whose works were exhibited, felt from Louise Bourgeois, Joseph Beuys, Lucio Fontana, Max Penck, Robert Morris, Robert Smithson in the 1980s, the Chapman brothers, Pierre Huyghe, Tacita Dean, Marguerite Humeau, Dove Allouche, Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla, Jean-Pascal Flavien, and Bertrand Lavier in the last few years. 'Prehistory is not an object given to artists to interpret; it is created by them' states Labrusse. 'I think artists are either Paleolithic or Neolithic. I am decidedly the lattersaidminimalist artist Carl Andre, according to the previously mentioned NYT article. HisStone Field Sculpturein Hartford, Connecticut, could have belonged to the Neolithic times. Painters and sculptors sometimes like to experiment with the artistic canons and the tradition of 'getting back to our roots,' to the 'early man,' asa 2024 exhibition at the Hole Galleryshows. 'Based around an out-of-print anthology devoted to prehistoric collections unearthed by archaeological expeditions in Algeria, French artist Camille Henrot's... [Prehistoric Collections] treats this ethnographic material as motifs of a contemporary grotesque,' states the Perimeter Books's website. Meanwhile, Mark Dion's immersive, uncanny installation at La Brea Tar Pits and Museum in September 2024,Excavations, displayed new work alongside 'early museum murals, dioramas, and maquettes of Ice Age mammals in a playful... presentation,' the museum website states. Labrusse recalls feeling 'powerless' when he started applying his scientific skills and methods to prehistoric art (he is a professor of art history atÉcole des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales). 'History requires context, facts, and elements to narrate it. These things are almost nonexistent when one looks back so far behind in time,' he explains. Many social scientists who study prehistoric history testify to a similar challenge. There is little evidence from prehistoric times and huge gaps of time for which the evidence is completely missing. 'Prehistorians have the scientific honesty to recognize an irreducible ignorance, an impossibility of bringing out meaning,' notes Labrusse. 'It is impossible to give a social, political, or aesthetic meaning to these societies.' During apodcast interviewin 2019, he explained feeling first 'like falling into a hole, caught up in an abyss of darkness. Then, as inAlice in Wonderland, you start to see through the looking glass.' For him, the turning point came while exploring a prehistoric cave, a 'very intimate, life-changing experience,' he says during the interview with me. Discovering parietal scenes in the cave of Roucadour, Labrusse felt 'as if they were contemporary. There is no context there, and things seem to float outside of any attributable meaning, so their appropriation is immediate, easy.' I learned this way to 'let go of the burden of history,' which 'dissolved like a soap bubble.' He recalls being tempted to touch these walls, reproducing these same gestures that the first men did back then. 'Science now tells us thatHomos sapienshas been the same for 100,000 years, even 300,000 years. Individuals have the same capacities, even possibly the same feelings as us today.' The limits of science, when confronted with prehistory, are also an opportunity that artists have often seized to contribute to the field in their own way. It gives them a chance to tell this story differently. Aware of this, contemporary prehistorians sometimes invite painters or sculptors to work with them to create interdisciplinary meaning, an epistemology articulating a subjective point of view (art) with an objective approach (science). The French government invited artists Ernest Pignon-Ernest, Giuseppe Penone, and Miquel Barceló, among others, to bring 'Other Perspectives' to theChauvet-Pont d'Arc cave. To understand how a howl decorating the cave had been originally drawn, Barceló recreated first the same wet surface that was used by his predecessor as a canvas 35,5000 years ago. He then drew a few lines like a graffiti artist in less than 10 seconds. His audacious and instinctive gesture was brilliant: the resulting drawing looked remarkably similar to the original one. 'Only an artist can do this with his subjective impulsivity,' comments Labrusse. 'A historian would not have dared to do it, keeping a rigorous mindset in his attempt to reproduce the drawing and, ultimately, failing to do so.' In another style, the notoriousAdrie and Alfons Kennis, twin brothers who are 'paleo artists,' are creating lifelike figures of early man that are touring museums and galleries around the world. Their hominids are fascinating and are another example of what art and science can do when working hand in hand.

Blinken Says ‘Now Is The Time’ To End War In Gaza	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called on Israel and the Iran-backed groups it is fighting in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon to call a truce after the Israeli military said it had killedatop officialfor Hezbollah, a militant group and political party that controls much of southern Lebanon, who had been widely expected to be the group’s next leader. 'Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success,' Blinken told reporters as he prepared to leave Jordan on October 23 for Saudi Arabia on a tour of the region for talks on how to bring the current fighting to an end. Late on October 22, Israel said Hashem Safieddine, a senior figure inside Hezbollah, waskilledin an air strike on the Lebanese capital on October 3, ending weeks ofspeculationas to whether the man expected to take over the group was alive. The previous Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in Israeli air strikes in Beirut on September 27.Safieddine headed Hezbollah's executive branch, which oversees the group's political affairs. He was also a member of the decision-making Shura Council as well as the Jihad Council, which runs the group's military operations.The United States designated Safieddine a terrorist in 2017. Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by Washington, although the European Union has only blacklisted its armed wing. Hezbollah’s political party has seats in the Lebanese parliament. The current war between Israel and the Iran-backed groups Hezbollah and Hamas -- which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union -- was triggered after Hamas militants made an incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people. They also took some 240 people back to Gaza as hostages.Israel has since launched a withering offensive that, according to the Hamas-led Heath Ministry in Gaza, has seen almost 43,000 people killed while displacing virtually all of Gaza's 2.3 million people.Israeli forces have killed many senior figures from Hezbollah and Hamas, including the Palestinian militant group's leader, Yahya Sinwar, who was suspected of being the mastermind behind the October 7 attacks. Sinwar waskilled last weekby the Israeli Defense Forces, prompting senior officials from the United States and other Israeli allies to seize on what they see as an opportunity for a new scenario for the region. Israel has also been under pressure from many allies, including the United States, for the rising number of civilian casualties in Gaza as a result of the war, and accusations that it has been hindering aid supplies to the territory, where hundreds of thousands are living in a growing humanitarian crisis. 'The focus needs to be on getting the hostages home, ending this war and having a clear plan for what follows,' Blinken said on October 23.Neither side, however, appears prepared, at least publicly, to seize on the so-called opportunity Blinken and others say is there for the taking.Just hours before Blinken spoke, the Israeli military leveled a suburban Beirut building that it said housed Hezbollah facilities. The strikes and a later one that sent thick columns of flames shooting into the night sky came shortly after an Israeli military spokesman issued evacuation warnings for the neighborhood.Another strike came with no warning hitting the nearby office of a pro-Iran broadcaster, the station said. It said the office had been empty since the conflict began. Lebanon's Health Ministry said one person was killed and five others, including a child, were wounded.Iran-backed Hezbollah said in a statement late on October 23 that it had escalated its attacks on Israel, using 'precision missiles' for the first time, and launched new types of drones on Israeli targets.It later said it had targeted an Israeli military factory on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.The Israeli military said four projectiles were identified as having been fired from Lebanon. Two were intercepted and one fell in an open area. There was no immediate indication of any defense facility around Tel Aviv having been hit. Meanwhile, Hamas continues to refuse to release the remaining hostages it holds unless Israel stops its attacks in Gaza.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e58ek8dPn3ySr	2024-10-24T15:54:03-07:00	
Parliamentary Elections 2024: Choice Time For Georgia	By Giorgi Lomsadze (Eurasianet) -- An image of a bombed-out church in Ukraine sits next to a picture of a perfectly intact Georgian church on a large billboard cantilevered over one of Tbilisi’s main thoroughfares. 'No to War, Choose Peace!' the billboard warns drivers and pedestrians that pass under it. Banners that contrast the visuals of the war-ravaged Ukraine to peaceful Georgia hang all over Georgian cities and towns as the nation enters the homestretch to a fiercely fought parliamentary campaign. The message of the incumbent Georgian Dream party, which is responsible for the political ads, is simple: if you vote for anyone else but us, Georgia will become embroiled in warfare. Many Georgians were outraged by the posters that they find preposterous and exploitative. 'They might as well place pictures of their dead [Ukrainian] children next to our live children,' civil rights activist Giorgi Kikonishvili wrote on Facebook. Popular journalist Merab Metreveli described the posters as 'amoral and nauseating.' The Ukrainian government also condemned the use of Ukraine’s suffering for campaign purposes in Georgia. Political parties that are challenging Georgian Dream in the October 26electionssay the scare-mongering tactics are meant to distract voters’ attention from Georgia’s real issues, in particular democratic backsliding, growing isolation from the West and state-capture by the country’s richest man,BidzinaIvanishvili. But the campaign, carefully crafted by Georgian Dream and its foreign PR advisers, does the trick on some voters. 'God knows, I don’t like Georgian Dream as there is not a single, even remotely pleasant person left in there, but I will still vote for them because my main priority is peace for my country, my children and my grandchildren,' said a 60-year-old Neli, who runs a flower kiosk in Tbilisi and agreed to share her voting plans without giving her full name. 'These posters are ugly, but it is also true that they [Georgian Dream] have managed to maintain peace so far, which is more than you can say about any other government we’ve had,' she said. Chiming in on the conversation, a middle-aged male customer said: 'I believe they will continue to maintain peace, not for our sake, no, but for their own sake and for the sake of Bidzina’s [Ivanishvili] millions.' The controversial ads could serve as an illustration of the wholesale political change that has occurred in Georgia in the shadow of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. The nation arrives at the 26 October pollsunrecognizablefrom the Georgia of 12 years ago, when Ivanishvili and his Georgian Dream came to power. Today, all government institutions are in a thrall to Ivanishvili’s personal interests and those interests appear to be at odds with Georgia’s longtime goals of democracy-building and integration with the West. Recent adoption of repressive laws, harassment of civil society, belligerent rhetoric toward the West and threats tobanoppositionparties have all but undone the years of work toward Georgia’s integration in the EU. Partnership with the United States – once Georgia’s top ally and supporter –hangsby the thread. The parties challenging Georgian Dream say that the elections offer a crucial and perhaps last chance to step back from the spiral toward autocracy and international isolation, and the imminent geopolitical volte-face toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia. 'Today, Georgian government is a part of the same threat that Russia poses to the civilized world,'saidAna Natsvlishvili, member of opposition party Lelo. Georgian Dream denies all of this. The party insists that Georgia is still going to join the EU – the stars of the EU flag stubbornly adorn the party’s many campaign posters – but will do so on its own terms. 'To Europe with Dignity,' as the campaign slogan specifies. Yet, at the same time, Georgian Dream makes moves that make Georgiaincompatiblewith the EU membership. The party offers homophobic laws and rhetoric, stokes fears of potential Western-provoked war with Russia, upbraids European ambassadors publicly, attacks democracy watchdogs and demands that the EU accept Georgia with its odd oligarchic rule. 'Georgia-EU relations, unfortunately, are at a historic minimum,' EU Ambassador Paweł Herczyńskisaidon October 22. 'EU leaders have clearly stated that this is a result of the actions of the Georgian government.' Ivanishvili is widely viewed as the guiding force of Georgian Dream and his ideas of how the world works is another can of worms. Ivanishvili is convinced that the West, especially the United States, has a hand in his personal financial troubles. As he fights in foreign courts to recover his assets from the troubled Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse, Ivanishvili keeps insinuating that Washington is somehow preventing him from getting his money back: denials from Washington cannot convince him otherwise. Five days before the vote, Ivanishvili appeared on TV to voice his party’s main campaign points. He accused the West of fomenting conflict and gender confusion around the world, and described his opponents as lackeys of foreign powers. But he also launched into a long account of his legal battles in the courts of Switzerland, Singapore and Bermuda, listing various bureaucratic, financial and legal delays he had faced. Without providing any evidence or any specific connection, he suggested the US authorities are somehow responsible for all these delays. In one instance, a financial expert hired by the defendant, Credit Suisse, took suspiciously long time to do his job, the billionaire said. 'The expert spent two months making calculations that should’ve taken two hours, and he even took a vacation in the middle,' Ivanishvili said. 'This is the reality and so do you still think that I’m imagining things?' Critics variously ascribe Ivanishvili’s conspiracy claims to delusions, or a calculated play. But most agree that the nation and its future are now dependent on one rich man’s personal views and interests. 'He is willing to sell Georgia’s geopolitical orientation for money,' said Giorgi Gakharia, former prime minister-turned-opposition leader. Georgia’s democratic, liberal and pro-EU forces have coalesced around severaloppositiongroupsthat intend to wrest a legislative majority away from Georgian Dream. The nation’s maverick, but ardently pro-Europe president Salome Zourabichvili has emerged as the effective leader of the opposition to Ivanishvili. Although not directly involved in the race, Zourabichvili has helped forge opposition’s unity around the goal of unseating Georgian Dream and getting Georgia back on track toward European integration. 'A new Georgia is coming,' Zourabichvili told a pro-EU demonstration in Tbilisi on October 20. 'Today, here are Georgians who are joining Europe in a peaceful, dignified and Georgian way,' she told a cheering crowd. The crowd at the demonstration was massive, illustrating Georgia’s strong desire to remove Ivanishvili from power. But the outcome of the election remains up in the air. Georgian Dream has its own support base, and also holds considerable sway over public-sector employees across Georgia. The party may still earn more seats than any individual opposition group, but the opposition parties can coalesce and, through a shared majority of votes, exclude Georgian Dream from governance. The wild card in this election is whether voting will be deemed free and fair. Fears of vote manipulation and reluctance to accept results are very much in the air.

Malaysia’s Confusing Foreign Policy – Analysis	Anwar’s non-appearance at the Kazan BRICS meeting raises some interesting questions When Malaysian prime minister Anwar Ibrahim announced and personally thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invitation to personally join the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, this was a clear message that Malaysia was pivoting towards the economic and trading based block. Traditionally, Malaysia has espoused itself as a non-aligned nation with sympathies towards Muslim nations, it considered as brothers. Under prime minister Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysia took in humanitarian refugees from Bosnia during the Bosnian war between 1992 and 1995. Malaysia’s stance was somewhat critical of US policy. However, Malaysia voted in the United Nations Security Council (Malaysia was a rotational member at the time) for military action against Iraq in the first Gulf War during 1990-1991. While prime minister, Najib Razak tilted Malaysia towards China, attracting investment in a number of Belt and Road (BRI) projects. One of the Barisan Nasional partners, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) became very close to the CCP United Front at the time. When Anwar Ibrahim became prime minister in November 2022, he very quickly announced that he saw Malaysian coexisting and cooperating with all nations in a multi-polar world. Anuar’s first trip was symbolically made to Saudi Arabia, and he later quickly travelled to Turkey during the earthquake in February 2023. Later in March 2023, Anwar made what was portrayed in the Malaysian government-controlled media as a highly successful trip. Interestingly enough, Anwar never visited the White House during his tenure as prime minister. However, while Malaysia’s non-alignment in a multi-polar world was publicly espoused, Malaysia had been cooperating with the US in surveillance flights over the South China Sea. The largely unreported Ops Hadir, originated during the Ismail Sabri Yaakob administration, and continued under Anwar. Ops Hadir is conducted between the Research Division of the Prime Minister’s Department, also known as the Malaysian External Intelligence Organization (MEIO) and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in areas adjacent to Sarawak has been very beneficial to Malaysia as Chinese Coast guard operations are frequently occurring in the area. This indicates Malaysia’s continued cooperation with US intelligence. The Kazan BRICS Summit The September 5 announcement by Anwar Malaysia would seek membership of BRICS came as a welcome surprise to many in Malaysia, who see the distinct economic and trade benefits. Although it was well publicised that Malaysia was seeking BRICS membership, where Bernama the official Malaysian news agency stated Malaysia was prioritised for BRICS membership, the Russian media contradicted this. RT on October 3, clearly indicated that Malaysia was not seeking membership of BRICS, this time round at least. Observers really don’t know whether Anwar’s absence is because of this, or whether he had not been formally invited as a national leader to the summit. Malaysia’s presence is very low key. Economy minister Rafizi Ramli is attending to summit to deliver a speech at a coordinated conference (BRICS Outreach), running parallel to the summit. While Anwar is not attending the BRICS Summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisel bin Farhan Al Saud is leading the Saudi delegation, Pham Minh Chinh Prime Minister of Vietnam, Recap Tayyip Erdogan President of Turkey, President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran, Abiy Ahmad prime minister of Ethiopia, and a large delegation from Palestine led by President Mahmoud Abbas, the executive committee of the PLO and five ministers are attending the summit. This doesn’t include the leaders of 24 other nations at the summit. Some suspect Anwar’s recent meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on October 10, on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting in Vientiane has something to do with his decision not to attend the BRICS Summit. This can only be speculation, but those advocating this point, look to Anwar’s very strong relationships with leaders within the Washington establishment, who supported him strongly during his days in opposition. Malaysia’s foreign policy appears to be driven by relationship under Anwar Since Anwar has become prime minister, there have been two foreign ministers in the relatively low ranked cabinet portfolio. Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir was replaced by Anwar with UMNO vice president Mohamad Hasan, after heavily public criticisms of Anwar’s visit to Saudi Arabia where he failed to secure a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Saman Al Saud, and China where there were criticisms over the authenticity of the reported RM 170 billion in direct foreign investment Anwar secured during his visit in April 2023. One can get a glimpse of Anwar’s foreign policy judgements with the differences in his reactions towards the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a pronounced good personal friend of Anwar, and the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, just recently, which was much more low key. That clearly indicates that Anwar’s personal relationships play some role in the foreign policy decisions he makes. The implications of this can be clearly seen in the approach many nations are making towards the issue of Palestine. Russian President Putin warmly welcomed the President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas as the legitimate leader of Palestine. Even though the Palestinian National Authority has an official embassy in Kuala Lumpur, all Anwar’s government efforts have been focused upon Hamas. While the BRICS summit is in play, there are calls for Anwar while Malaysia is chair of ASEAN in 2025, to go on and lead the global. BRICS is clearly taking up this role now. There can be a lot of truth that many of Anwar’s announcements on foreign policy, particularly during his numerous overseas trips are aimed at domestic consumption than actual long-term policy. Under Anwar, as it has been during previous administrations, foreign policy will continue to be more ad hoc than ideologically based. Only this time, observers will be able to see where Malaysian foreign policy stands through Anwar’s personal relationships.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd0NgXJ5ecW8jJIJpcVaipe	2024-10-24T09:48:15-07:00	
Indonesia And BRICS: Balancing Economic Opportunities With Geopol...	The recent meeting of BRICS (comprising Russia, Brazil, China, India, and South Africa) in Kazan in October 2024 has significant implications for the evolving dynamics of global governance. As there are increasing demands for a multipolar world to counter Western hegemony, BRICS has emerged as a critical platform for nations aiming to reshape global power structures. Indonesia, recognized as Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is meticulously evaluating the benefits and risks of joining BRICS, with an emphasis on enhancing its global influence while adhering to its longstanding policy of non-alignment. This essay analyzes how Indonesia could derive benefits from economic, political, and technological cooperation within BRICS while concurrently confronting challenges associated with its geopolitical position and commitments to ASEAN. The potential outcomes of the Kazan meeting—particularly concerning the expansion of BRICS membership—situate Indonesia at a pivotal crossroads between its traditional non-aligned posture and the prospect of adopting a more proactive role in international affairs. Economic Cooperation: Prospects and Pitfalls Indonesia’s aspiration to join BRICS is largely motivated by the bloc’s potential to facilitate economic diversification and resilience. As BRICS member countries grapple with vulnerabilities stemming from Western-dominated financial systems, the bloc is actively pursuing strategies to diminish dependence on the US dollar and Western markets through initiatives such as currency swaps and intra-bloc trade agreements. For Indonesia, these initiatives represent a substantial opportunity to fortify its trade relationships with emerging markets while mitigating its reliance on conventional Western partners. Membership in BRICS would also provide Indonesia with access to the New Development Bank, enabling the financing of large-scale infrastructure projects, and thereby delivering a crucial impetus to national development. However, the economic benefits are accompanied by potential drawbacks. Indonesia’s extensive trade ties with Western economies, notably the European Union and the United States, could be jeopardized if Jakarta aligns too closely with BRICS. Given that Western nations have imposed sanctions on Russia and maintained strained relations with China, Indonesia must navigate this landscape judiciously to avoid compromising its economic connections with these essential markets. Furthermore, joining BRICS could complicate Indonesia’s position within ASEAN, as it would necessitate a careful balancing act between regional cooperation and participation in a bloc that occasionally operates in contradiction to ASEAN’s principles of neutrality and non-interference. Geopolitical Alignment: Balancing BRICS, ASEAN and Politics BRICS presents an attractive platform for Indonesia to assert its leadership on the global stage. As the group advocates for a multipolar world order, Indonesia could amplify its voice in global governance, contributing to discussions on key issues such as global security, climate change, and economic inequality. Furthermore, membership in BRICS would allow Indonesia to strengthen ties with China and Russia, two major global powers that possess significant strategic interests in Southeast Asia. However, Indonesia’s entry into BRICS poses substantial diplomatic challenges. Indonesia’s foreign policy, which is deeply rooted in non-alignment, could be tested by BRICS’ more assertive political stance. For instance, BRICS has expressed varying degrees of support for Russia amid the Ukraine conflict, a position that may conflict with Indonesia’s emphasis on peace, dialogue, and non-intervention. Moreover, Indonesia’s leadership role within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) could be compromised, as ASEAN has traditionally prioritized regional consensus and neutrality. If Indonesia joins BRICS, it risks being perceived as aligning with a bloc that occasionally challenges Western-led international norms. The delicate balance between these two roles—being a leader in ASEAN and a BRICS member—will require Indonesia to maintain diplomatic flexibility, ensuring that its engagement with BRICS aligns with both its national interests and regional responsibilities. Technological Innovation: A Path to Development One of the most promising areas for Indonesia’s potential collaboration within BRICS is technological innovation. The bloc has made significant strides in promoting digital currencies, cybersecurity, and advanced research and development (R&D). As Indonesia aims to enhance its digital economy and technological capabilities, BRICS could provide a platform for greater cooperation in these domains. Joint R&D initiatives with BRICS nations could accelerate Indonesia’s progress in key sectors such as fintech, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, enabling the country to catch up with more technologically advanced nations. Nevertheless, the technological benefits of BRICS membership are contingent upon Indonesia’s capacity to scale up its technological infrastructure. While BRICS can offer partnerships and support, Indonesia will need to invest significantly in its digital infrastructure and workforce development to fully leverage these opportunities. Additionally, Indonesia must navigate the geopolitical dimensions of technology cooperation. As Western nations increase scrutiny of BRICS technology initiatives—particularly those led by China and Russia—Indonesia may face pressures to limit its engagement in certain technology partnerships within BRICS. Cultural and Social Cooperation: Power, Soft Diplomacy and Economics Beyond geopolitics, BRICS provides Indonesia with an opportunity to enhance its soft power through cultural and social exchanges. As a member of BRICS, Indonesia could engage in educational and cultural initiatives designed to foster greater understanding among member states. Such exchanges would enable Indonesia to project its cultural influence on a global stage, thereby strengthening its image as a diverse and inclusive society. However, Indonesia must also navigate cultural differences within BRICS, particularly given the varied political systems and societal norms of the member countries. By promoting its values of democracy, pluralism, and tolerance, Indonesia could position itself as a cultural bridge within the bloc. Concurrently, Indonesia needs to exercise caution to avoid compromising its principles while engaging with BRICS members who may adhere to different governance and human rights standards. Recommendations In deciding to join BRICS, Indonesia should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of its strategic priorities. First, Indonesia must ensure that BRICS membership aligns with its economic objectives of diversification and technological advancement without jeopardizing its relationships with Western markets and ASEAN. Second, Indonesia should advocate for diplomatic flexibility within BRICS, maintaining its non-aligned stance while contributing to the bloc’s broader geopolitical objectives. Finally, Indonesia must invest in its technological infrastructure to maximize the benefits of cooperation with BRICS in innovation research and development. Conclusion The BRICS meeting in Kazan in October 2024 represents a pivotal moment for Indonesia as it deliberates on joining the bloc. While BRICS offers Indonesia opportunities for economic diversification, geopolitical influence, and technological cooperation, these advantages must be weighed against the potential risks of alienating Western partners and straining its position within ASEAN. To succeed within BRICS, Indonesia will need to maintain a careful balance between its national interests, regional responsibilities, and global ambitions. Ultimately, Indonesia’s participation in BRICS could enhance its position in a multipolar world, provided that it effectively navigates the challenges of alignment and cooperation.

Bangladesh And Pakistan Pay The Price For Rejecting British Const...	Bangladeshi public intellectual Afsan Chowdhury says that constitutional transfer of power eludes Bangladesh and Pakistan because these countries failed to imbibe the constitutional norms of British rule, unlike India and Sri Lanka. Even 53 years after becoming an independent country, Bangladesh has not developed a stable system of transfer of power from one government to another. Bangladeshi public intellectual Afsan Chowdhury says that constitutional transfer of power has been eluding Bangladesh and Pakistan because these countries failed to imbibe the constitutional norms of British rule, unlike India and Sri Lanka. Bangladeshi Governments have been shaky, fearing either the restive masses or the powerful military. Even military rulers were insecure because of factionalism within the ranks, which was often violent and murderous. From 1971 to 1990, governance was patently undemocratic. The very first Bangladeshi regime led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was anything but democratic. It was also violently overthrown by a faction of the army in August 1975. But Sheikh Mujib's removal did not bring stability. There were two more military coups in 1975. Finally, Army Chief Gen. Ziaur Rahman took over and restored order assuming full power in 1977. Zia purged the army of revolutionary, leftist and pro-Mujib officers. However, Zia put Bangladesh on the geopolitical map of South Asia,by founding SAARC, Islamizing the country, and moving close to Pakistan in preference to India. In 1978, he created the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to compete with Sheikh Hasina's pro-Indian Awami League in elections. But his intolerant streak crushed dissent had bred intolerance inturn. He was assassinated by a faction of the army in 1981. Zia was replaced by another military dictator, Gen. H.M.Ershad. Hecontributed to Bangladesh in the field of economic development. But he was a dictator. A massive all party agitation forced him to quit in 1990 handing over power to a non-party Caretaker Government. In the 1991 elections, the BNP led by Khaleda Zia got 30.81% and the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina got 30.03%. But under the First Past the Post System, BNP won more seats and formed the government with Khaleda Zia as Prime Minister. The Awami League demanded that Bangladesh switch from the Presidential to the parliamentary system with the Prime Minister as the Chief Executive. Accordingly, the BNP government passed the Twelfth Constitutional Amendment, which restored the parliamentary form of government. After 15 years of military rule, Bangladesh appeared to be on the way to becoming a democracy with a broad consensus on governance. But anxieties about the neutrality of electoral institutions and the need to sustain patron–client relations fuelled political antagonism and violence. Ruling parties attempted to weaken the opposition through human rights violations. In 1994, the Awami League accused the ruling BNP of political thuggery and held mass protests, strikes, and blockades demanding anon-partisan Caretaker Government that would ensure free and fair elections. The BNP argued that such an unelected body would be unconstitutional. The Awami League boycotted the February 1996 elections. So, unopposed, the BNP was back in power. But BNP rule was unpopular. It was forced to submit to the Awami League's demand for a Caretaker Government to conduct elections. Parliament passed the Thirteenth Amendment for this purpose. In the June 1996 re-elections, under a Caretaker Government, the Awami League won. Ahead of the 2001 elections, the Awami League handed over power to a Caretaker Government. The BNP won the 2001 elections. But the BNP regime was unpopular. In 2006, ahead of the 2007 elections, political turmoil erupted. The BNP and the Awami League locked horns over choosing a candidate to head the Caretaker Government before fresh elections could take place. In October 2006, President Iajuddin Ahmed declared himself head ofthe Caretaker Government, and announced that elections would be held in January 2007. However, on January 11, 2007, Army Chief Lt General Moeen Ahmed staged a military coup .He formed a military-backed Caretaker Government with Fakhruddin Ahmed, an economist, as its head. President Iajuddin Ahmed remained President of the country. The Fakhruddin Ahmed's Caretaker Government launched an anti-corruption drive imprisoning several prominent politicians, including Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia of BNP. This alienated the public. In the 2008 elections, the Awami League was swept to power. In June 2011, the Awami League dominated parliament passed the Fifteenth Constitutional Amendment, which abolished the Caretaker Government system. As a consequence, the BNP boycotted the parliamentary elections in January 2014. In January 2015, antagonisms between political partiesdrew Bangladesh into yet another round of intense violence. The Awami League accused the BNP of terrorism and arrested over 10,000 opposition activists. Over 60 people were killed.The BNP then felt that there was no option but to boycott elections all elections not conducted under a new Caretaker Government. Thus, Bangladesh came to be run as a de-facto one-party Awami League government under Sheikh Hasina. This lasted till August 2024. The absolute power that Hasina acquired, corrupted her absolutely. In the absence of a functioning opposition party, the BNP having been crippled by arrests of its leaders, the aggrieved masses had to take the law into their hands and unseat Hasina. On August 5, 2024, following a month and a half long widespread agitation in which more than 1000 were killed, Sheikh Hasina fled the country. The university student-led mass movement was meant to restore democracy. But till date, it has not been restored. Parliament was dissolved and MPs fled for their lives. A Council was formed to advice President Mohammed Shahabuddin, with Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus as Chief Advisor. The Advisory Council is planning structural reforms through six committees. It has ruled out elections before reforming the system. But democracy lovers said that this is putting the cart before the horse. The whole purpose of the protest movement was to restore democracy and take decisions on the basis of consultations and not postponing elections. Recently, President Mohammed Shahabuddin threw a spanner in the works, when he told Matiur Rahan Chowdhury, the editor of 'Manab Zamin' that he had 'no documentary evidence of Sheikh Hasina's resignation.' The President told Chowdhury that he was expecting Hasina to call on him and submit a resignation letter on August 5. Butthe Army Chief Gen.Waker-uz-Zamam came instead and said that Hasina had left the country. The President's interview to Manab Zamin was interpreted to mean that he deemed Sheikh Hasina to be Prime Minister of Bangladesh still, and that the interim government and the Council of Advisors lacked legality. Some even darkly hinted that the President, having been an appointee of Sheikh Hasina, was part of a plot to bring her back and thwart the move to drag her before the Bangladesh War Crime Tribunal to answer serious charges. Others said that this was army's move to bring Hasina back because the Editor of Manab Zamin is 'close' to the army and Army chief Gen.Waker-uz-Zamam is a relation of Hasina's. Those who had agitated for a month to oust Hasina stormed the Presidential palace 'Bangababon' calling for Shahabuddin's resignation. The police opened fire injuring at least three youngsters. The Law Advisor in the Council of Advisors declared President Shahabuddin as being unfit to hold the high office. Eventually, President Shahabuddin apologised for what he said. But to his credit he never said that the successor Interim Government led by Muhammad Yunus is illegitimate. As a jurist himself, Shahabuddin knew that Bangladesh courts had, multiple times in the past, legitimized governments that had come into being by unorthodox means like a military coup. Challenges to state authority in Bangladesh have generally stemmed from the inability of institutions to adequately ensure power sharing and consensual decision making. Political will for electoral reform has been elusive because an alternative system might dim the prospect of controlling state resources for personal benefit. Greed has become the basic motivation in Bangladesh politics. According to Bangladeshi public intellectual Afsan Chowdhury, if constitutional transfer of power continues to elude Bangladesh, it is because it had not adopted the constitutional values British rule had given India and Sri Lanka. India and Sri Lanka had faithfully adopted the British legacy while Pakistan and Bangladesh charted a different path.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcboBDWImDqhXLCA9Q3uRBm	2024-10-24T09:44:33-07:00	
China, Russia, North Korea And Iran Described As New ‘Axis Of Evi...	By Xiaoshan Xue U.S. officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the emerging partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea – a bloc being talked about by some in Washington as a new 'axis of evil.' Those worries got a major boost on Wednesday with confirmation by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a trip to Rome that North Korean troops are now present in Russia, presumably preparing to participate in Moscow’s war on Ukraine. Just days earlier, Russia was a participant in naval drills hosted by Iran. China, North Korea and Iran all have supported Russia's war machine in different ways during its war on Ukraine. Iran has provided missiles and drones. North Korea has sent artillery shells. And China has provided dual-use technology and industrial products, including semiconductors and drone engines. 'We've seen the emergence of Axis of Evil back in the late 1930s, 1938, 1939. We saw what the world did at that particular point to come together,' said Republican congressman Rob Wittman, vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during an online discussion last month hosted by the Center for a New American Security. 'We find ourselves at that same crossroads today where we have nations that do not believe in the same things that we believe in, do not believe in the rule of law, do not believe in protecting the rights and dignity of human beings.' In 2002, former U.S. President George W. Bush used the term 'axis of evil' in his State of the Union address to describe countries supporting terrorism, such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. More recently, it is being applied in Washington to describe China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken describes these four countries as revisionist powers. He wrote that a fierce competition to define a new era of international affairs is under way, and a few countries are determined to change the basic principles of the international system. 'While these countries are not an axis, and the administration has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent that outcome,'Blinken wrotein the November/December issue of the publicationForeign Affairs. Wittman does use the term 'Axis of Evil' and said the countries involved are more capable of destabilizing the world than were Nazi Germany and its allies in 1939, especially as they cooperate and share technology at all levels. 'So, as you look at drones that have been taken out in Ukraine, you find Chinese printed circuit boards in there, Chinese systems on board those drones,' Wittman told VOA. 'You also see the arms that are being fired into Ukraine from Russian artillery pieces are being manufactured in North Korea. You see the drones that are being used by Russians in the battle space there are being manufactured by Iran.' He also said the new partnership is learning from the Ukrainian war at a rate that keeps pace with the times, gaining capabilities that cannot be achieved in normal testing and development processes in a peaceful environment. 'The biggest difference in the 2024 Axis of Evil is that at least three of the four countries are in expansionist mode,'wrote Merrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation earlier this year. 'They want much more land and power. And they are coordinating their efforts to benefit each country’s goals. It’s a very dangerous development.' Matthews told VOA this group is working to create a largely self-sufficient economic zone — out of both necessity and desire — that does not rely on Western economies for survival. Christopher S. Chivvis, a senior fellow and director of the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told VOA that China is key to the strength of the four-way relationship. 'If China were not part of this four, it would look like three countries that are highly isolated from the world cooperating with each other. We would have much less to worry about. It's China's participation in this grouping that is really has the potential to make it very problematic for the United States,' he said. Chivvis added that the four countries can use a crisis in one region to launch a war, coordinate actions, or create chaos in another. For example, Chivvis lays out a more extreme version of this scenarioin his recent report— were China to attempt a military operation against Taiwan, Russia might seek to take advantage of the strain on U.S. resources with an even more aggressive military campaign in Ukraine or even with an incursion into NATO territory. Similarly, a major escalation with Iran in the Middle East that draws in more U.S. naval and air forces could also embolden China to take a more aggressive approach to Taiwan. 'It would be difficult for these four countries to sign a formal treaty that would commit them to doing that kind of thing, but you can see it emerging spontaneously or organically out of a crisis situation,' Chivvis said. And a crisis in one region can spill over to another part of the world. 'If you look at, for example, the Gulf Arab states, they're critical energy suppliers to both China and Taiwan,' said Michael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'If you look at Iran, Iran has the capabilities we've seen through proxies like the Houthis to disrupt international waterways. So, to think that a conflict over Taiwan will be restricted to the Indo-Pacific is, I think at this stage, simply naive and ignoring.' Blinken describes the relationship among the four countries as 'largely transactional,' adding that their cooperation 'entails tradeoffs and risks that each may find more distasteful over time.' 'And yet all four revisionists share an abiding commitment to the overarching objective of challenging the United States and the international system,' Blinken wrote. 'That will continue to drive their cooperation, especially as the United States and other countries stand up to their revisionism.' Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcboBDWImDqhQLaPCXiUbt3	2024-10-24T09:43:10-07:00	
Japan Goes To Polls: Political Instability Feared – Analysis	After succeeding Fumio Kishida as the Prime Minister of Japan, Shigeru Ishida called for a snap election on 28 October 2024. But it soon dawned on him and the ruling coalition government that his popularity rating had dramatically plummeted. With several opinion surveys indicating that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito coalition could possibly lose its majority. If that actually happens, what could be the possible strategy for the LDP? One possibility is the LDP might rope in a third party to form a government. A total of 233 seats are needed in the 465-seat chamber for a majority. When it was dissolved on 9 October, the LDP held 256 seats and Komeito 32, for a total of 288. But the public backlash over an LDP-centered slush funds scandal has put the ruling bloc’s 55 seat majority in jeopardy. An opinion poll by the Asahi Shimbun daily suggested the final tally for both parties could be less than 233 seats, prompting questions over what would happen next in such a scenario. The poll said that 33 per cent of voters support the Ishiba Cabinet, which is lower than the support rate for the previous Kishida Cabinet in 2021. This was against 39 per cent endorsed by the non-supporters. In a speech delivered on 15 October, Ishiba promised to release 'new economic policies'. But the poll revealed that 53 per cent said they do not have high expectations for Ishiba’s economic policies as against 24 per cent expressed optimism. In a similar survey conducted in 2021 before the previous Lower House election soon after Kishida became the Prime Minister, 42 per cent expressed support for Kishida, while 31 per cent said they did not support. However, 45 per cent said they did not have high expectations for Kishida’s economic policies. In the latest survey, twenty-eight percent of voters who said they do not support the Ishiba Cabinet chose the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Eleven percent selected the Democratic Party for the People, and 10 percent picked Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party). Interestingly, sixty-three percent of voters who expressed support for the Ishiba Cabinet and 61 percent of voters who said they have high expectations for Ishiba’s economic policies said they would vote for the LDP. Thirty-two percent of voters said they are greatly interested in the 27 October election, and 66 percent said they will definitely go to the polls. Both figures are at low levels, compared with results of similar surveys between 2005 and 2021. Since the survey methods and targets were different from earlier surveys, a close parallel between the two surveys need not be seen as same indicators. It transpires therefore that the LDP is shaken by low public support rating for the Ishiba Cabinet. The LDP undoubtedly is heading towards unexpected headwinds when polls are held on 28 October. Ishiba seeking forgiveness from the voters for his party’s massive slush fund scandal is not going to help him or the party. Like the Asahi opinion survey, there was another survey conducted by the Jiji. Its results announced days before the election revealed that public support for the Ishiba Cabinet stood at 28 per cent. This alarmed many in the LDP since a support rating under 30 per cent is said to signal that the administration is in the 'danger zone'. Just a month ago, when Ishiba won the LDP Presidential race on 27 September, Ishiba was the top pick for the next prime minister but public expectations soon faded. This was solely because of the peoples’ frustration with the unabated criticism of the LDP over the fund scandal. Viewed critically, the scandal does not seem to be the only reason for Ishiba's low initial rating. It was even lower than the previous lowest starting rating since 2000, which was 33.3% marked by former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's Cabinet just after its April 2000 launch. What worked against Ishiba is that during the LDP presidential race before he became Prime Minister, he made bold proposals but soon wavered over key issue. This was a major reason of the trust deficit as revealed by the survey. In a quirk of political misfortune for Ishiba, after being elected as the LDP president and thereby becoming the prime minister, his honeymoon period seems to have already expired. Ishiba made mistakes. Much against his promise for full-scale debates with opposition parties at the budget committees of both of Diet’s chambers he closed the extraordinary parliamentary session without any such debates. He promised to strengthen financial income taxation and introduce a selective dual surname system for married couples, but he soon back-peddled on contentious issues. Thus, besides the slush fund scandal, Ishiba’s wavering stance and unclear statements led to the decline of public support for his Cabinet. These raise the spectre of the LDP losing its single-handed majority in the Lower House. As indicated by the surveys, maintaining a majority together with Komeito could be a tough call for Ishiba. If the LDP loses many seats, public support for Ishiba's Cabinet is likely to fall. With fragile power base Ishiba could be heading towards a critical moment. From all indicators, it seems to emerge that the LDP is heading towards an electoral bleeding. After trying for five times for the LDP presidential bid, when he finally won, the veteran Ishiba was seen as a fresh face but he could quickly end up being a forgotten one. The red alert signals are already sounding in Tokyo’s corridors of power. Ishiba’s hasty call for snap election now seems to backfire. If the LDP fails to keep a majority, it could be difficult for Ishiba to hold on to power with its long-standing coalition partner Komeito. As said in the beginning, a new partner needs to be searched, which would mean more compromise and slow decision-making. Though such a possibility may not happen given the opposition’s weak political base, it would not be unthinkable either. If that happens, it would be the first time in over a decade when Japan shall enter into a phase of political instability and revolving prime minister.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf13_asNBrtabsp7eEW8h66	2024-10-24T09:40:18-07:00	
Report Shows NASA’s $75.6 Billion Boost To US Economy	NASA's work, including its Moon to Mars exploration approach, is advancing science and technology for the Artemis Generation, while also driving significant economic growth across the United States, the agency announced Thursday. In its third agencywide economic impact report, NASA highlighted how its Moon to Mars activities, climate change research and technology development, and other projects generated more than $75.6 billion in economic output across all 50 states and Washington, D.C., in fiscal year 2023. 'To invest in NASA is to invest in American workers, American innovation, the American economy, and American economic competitiveness,' says NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'Our work doesn't just expand our understanding of the universe — it fuels economic growth, inspires future generations, and improves our quality of life. As we embark on the next great chapter of exploration, we are proud to help power economic strength, job creation, scientific progress, and American leadership on Earth, in the skies, and in the stars.' Combined, NASA's missions supported 304,803 jobs nationwide, and generated an estimated $9.5 billion in federal, state, and local taxes throughout the United States. The study found NASA's Moon to Mars activities generated more than $23.8 billion in total economic output and supported an estimated 96,479 jobs nationwide. For investments in climate research and technology, the agency's activities generated more than $7.9 billion in total economic output and supported an estimated 32,900 jobs in the U.S. Additional key findings of the study include: Every state in the country benefits economically through NASA activities. Forty-five states have an economic impact of more than $10 million. Of those 45 states, eight have an economic impact of $1 billion or more. The agency's Moon to Mars initiative, which includes the Artemis missions, generated nearly $2.9 billion in tax revenue. These activities provided about 32% of NASA's economic impact. The agency's investments in climate change research and technology generated more than $1 billion in tax revenue. Approximately 11% of NASA's economic impacts are attributable to its investments in climate change research and technology. NASA had more than 644 active international agreements for various scientific research and technology development activities in the 2023 fiscal year. The International Space Station, representing 15 countries and five space agencies, has a predominant role in the agency's international partnerships. In fiscal year 2023, NASA oversaw 2,628 active domestic and international non-procurement partnership agreements, which included 629 new domestic and 109 new international agreements, active partnerships with 587 different non-federal partners across the U.S., and partnerships in 47 of 50 states. NASA Spinoffs, which are public products and processes that are developed with NASA technology, funding, or expertise, provide a benefit to American lives beyond dollars and jobs. As of result of NASA missions, our fiscal year 2023 tech transfer activities produced 1,564 new technology reports, 40 new patent applications, 69 patents issued, and established 5,277 software usage agreements. Scientific research and development, which fuels advancements in science and technology that can help improve daily life on Earth and for humanity, is the largest single-sector benefitting from NASA's work, accounting for 19% of NASA's total economic impact. Thestudywas conducted by the Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement at the University of Illinois at Chicago.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf13_asNBrtaYGaAZ49YBuA	2024-10-24T09:37:41-07:00	
AUKUS Partners Complete Successful Tests Of Autonomous And Networ...	In a significant development for maritime security, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom (AUKUS) have completed successful tests of several autonomous and networked systems during a three-week maritime experimentation called Autonomous Warrior 24 in Australia, the US Department of Defense said Thursday. The event was part of the Maritime Big Play (MBP) initiative and ongoing efforts to develop AUKUS Pillar II capabilities, a trilateral collaboration to improve maritime awareness through networked autonomy, decision advantage, and enhanced strike. The Maritime Big Play is a series of integrated trilateral experiments and exercises that are enhancing capability development, improving interoperability, and increasing the sophistication and scale of autonomous systems in the maritime domain. Australia led the Autonomous Warrior event, the signature MBP event in 2024. Other events associated with Maritime Big Play included the Robotic Experimentation and Prototyping Augmented by Maritime Unmanned Systems (REPMUS); and Technology Readiness Experimentation (T-REX). Through these experiments and exercises, AUKUS partners are further testing and refining the ability to jointly operate uncrewed maritime systems, share and process maritime data from all three nations, and provide real-time maritime domain awareness to support decision-making. 'Autonomous Warrior/Maritime Big Play creates a unique opportunity for our three countries to work together, which will ultimately improve operational efficiency and allow us to work more cohesively against common threats,' said Heidi Shyu, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. 'This collaborative approach enables us to reduce acquisition, maintenance, and training cost by creating economies of scale.' The technologies tested during the October event support operations from deep under water to the edge of space. This included software-defined acoustic modems, multi-model autonomous underwater and surface vessels, and low-cost attritable unmanned surface vehicles. The tests also featured a low-cost gondola, which supports operations in the upper stratosphere with minimum manpower or logistics requirements, and T-200 high-altitude balloons, which provide resilient communications in denied environments from the stratosphere. A versatile and robust software-defined network architecture called Multi-Domain Uncrewed Secure Integrated Communications (MUSIC) was tested for its ability to enable seamless communication and coordination across diverse unmanned systems and operational environments. The Common Control System (CCS) was also featured in the exercise, built on an open architecture to provide uncrewed vehicles hardware and software that works across several different systems. This effort supports future work to create an AUKUS-wide Common Control System, fusing best elements of the three countries’ existing systems. 'AUKUS partners have long histories of working together on defense and security issues, and have deep, enduring partnerships based on shared values, said Shyu. 'By investing in novel and innovative capabilities directly aligned to AUKUS mission priorities, as well as making future advancements in emerging technologies like AI and Quantum, we support a more stable region — one where all nations are empowered to make their own sovereign decisions free from coercion — a world that centers on hope for the opportunity and prosperity of the future.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf13_asNBrtaSsAGWefyARB	2024-10-24T09:35:29-07:00	
Kaab’a And Jerusalem Temple Mount Linked By Holiness – OpEd	There is a Holy Link between the Muslim Kaab'a and the Jewish Jerusalem Temple. Shamefully, politicalized religious leaders have turned sacred sites in both India and Israel into battlegrounds for their brand of religious exclusivity. Yet an ancient Jewish legend predicts that when the Messiah comes and resurrection day occurs; the Kaab'a in holy Mecca, will go to join the Temple Mount's Foundation Stone in holy Jerusalem, bringing the inhabitants of Mecca, and they shall be joined together. When the Foundation Stone sees the Kaab'a approaching, it shall cry out, 'Peace be to the great guest'. (Zev Vilnay, Legends of Jerusalem) The Muslim Kaab'a in Mecca was a very ancient ruined holy site that was rebuilt under God's direction by Prophets Abraham and his oldest son Ishmael. The Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was built on a site God chose for an offering of Prophet Abraham's youngest son, and built by Prophet Solomon the son of King David, more than four centuries after Prophet Abraham. There is a wonderful legend that explains what linked these two sacred sites that had become holy to the descendants of the two sons of Prophet Abraham. 'Two brothers who inherited a valley to hilltop farm from their father, divided the land in half so each one could farm his own section. Over time, the older brother married and had four children, while the younger brother was still not married. One year there was very little rain, and the crop was very meager. The younger brother lay awake one night praying and thought. 'My brother has a wife and four children to feed and I have no children. He needs more grain than I do; especially now when grain is scarce.' So that night the younger brother went to his barn, gathered a large sack of wheat, and left his wheat in his brother's barn. Then he returned home, feeling pleased with himself. Earlier that very same night, the older brother was also lying awake praying for rain when he thought: 'In my old age my wife and I will have our grown children to take care of us, as well as grandchildren to enjoy, while my brother may have no children. He should at least sell more grain from his fields now, so he can provide for himself in his old age.' So that night, the older brother also gathered a large sack of wheat, and left it in his brother's barn, and returned home, feeling pleased with himself. The next morning, the younger brother, surprised to see the amount of grain in his barn seemed unchanged said 'I did not take as much wheat as I thought. Tonight I'll take more.' That same morning, the older brother standing in his barn, was thinking the same thoughts. After night fell, each brother gathered a greater amount of wheat from his barn and in the dark, secretly delivered it to his brother's barn. The next morning, the brothers were again puzzled and perplexed. 'How can I be mistaken?' each one thought. 'There's the same amount of grain here as there was before. This is impossible! Tonight I'll make no mistake - I'll take two large sacks.' The third night, more determined than ever, each brother gathered two large sacks of wheat from his barn, loaded them onto a cart, and slowly pulled his cart toward his brother's barn. In the moonlight, each brother noticed a figure in the distance. When the two brothers got closer, each recognized the form of the other and the load he was pulling, and they both realized what had happened. Without a word, they dropped the ropes of their carts, ran to each other and embraced.' God looked down at the two brothers thinking 'Their love and concern for each other has made these two places worthy of becoming a linked holy sanctuary. Someday their descendants will each build and rebuild a holy House in this valley and on this hill. Very few Jews and Muslims realize that for more than 1,000 years, while Jerusalem's First and Second Temple--Bait ul Muqaddas-Beit HaMiqdash stood, the Jewish festival of Hag Sukkot was celebrated as a Hajj, a pilgrimage festival. The Hebrew word Hag comes from hagag to circle; and the Arabic word Hajj literally means 'to set out for a special place'. For Muslims, the Furthest Sanctuary is located in Jerusalem. 'Glory to He Who carried His servant by night, from the Holy Sanctuary to the Furthest Sanctuary, the precincts of which We have blessed. So that We might show him some of Our signs. Surely He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. (Qur'an 17:1) It is significant that the ruins of the Jerusalem Temple was the site of Prophet Muhammad's ascension—miraj-- up to the heavens. The Kaa'ba built by Abraham and Ishmael, was some centuries later polluted by the introduction of idols. Some centuries later King Solomon built a Temple on the site where Prophet Abraham bound Isaac as an offering. Then four and a half centuries later the Temple of Solomon was destroyed by the Babylonians. It was then rebuilt only to again be destroyed some centuries later by the Romans (in 70 CE), who would later pollute the whole site with a Roman city whose buildings and streets were filled with idols. One might say the destruction of the Furthest Sanctuary center of monotheistic pilgrimage in Jerusalem by the pagan Romans, was five and a half centuries afterward overcome by Prophet Muhammad's ascension-miraj up to the heavens, and the soon to be realized removal by Prophet Muhammad of the 360 idols around the paganized Kaa'ba (Holy Sanctuary) in Makkah. The Prophet Zechariah envisions a future time when God helps humans establish worldwide peace. All the nations in the world then may travel to Makkah and Jerusalem to worship God in peace. It is important for Muslims to realize that during this prophesied future Hajj Sukkot, the future city of Jerusalem (without a physically rebuilt Temple) will welcome both Jews and non-Jews, just as it did in the days when Prophet David (before King Solomon built the Temple) wrote in his Zabur: 'I rejoiced with those who said to me, 'Let us go up to the house of the LORD...There the (12) tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, as it was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 122:1-4) Orthodox Jews still pray for the ancient Temple to be rebuilt. But Reform Jews stopped doing that two centuries ago. The place is holy; not the building. This is the feeling of the great majority of Jews today who are not Orthodox Jews. Just as the Kaa'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a three dimensional virtual reality broadcast station could be erected adjacent to the Dome of the Rock fulfilling the vision of Prophet Micah (4:1-3) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and (monotheistic) peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. Torah will be broadcast out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' provided that Muslim leaders would cooperate. So, when all those, both near and far, who revere this place as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then I will do as Abraham requested, and 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). Then will all the children of Adam and Abraham live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. This narration, transmitted orally in both Arabic and Hebrew for many centuries, was finally written down in several versions in the 19th century. Jews believe the hill is Jerusalem. Muslims believe the valley is Mecca. I believe, God willing, someday we all will see both beliefs as correct. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (Qur'an 16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. The Qur'an states: 'For every nation there is a direction to which they face (in prayer). So hasten towards all that is good. Wherever you may be, Allâh will bring you together. Truly, Allâh is able to do all things.' (2:148) The commentary/Tafsir of al-Jalalayn states: 'Every person, of every community, has his direction/qibla, to which he turns in prayer, so compete with one another in good works; strive with acts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together, gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your deeds; surely God has power over all things.' Now, which way you face during community prayer, is not the most important thing. The Qur'an (2:177) tells us: 'Righteous is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but righteous is [in] one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, the Prophets; and gives wealth in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives Zakah; fulfilling their promise when they promise; and are patient in poverty, hardship and during battle. These are the ones who have been true, and it is these who are the righteous.' Prophet Zechariah in chapter 14 foresees a day when many gentiles will celebrate Sukkot alongside Jews, not by building booths on their diaspora residences, but by converging annually upon Jerusalem to worship God—a time when 'Adonaiwill be one, and his name one' (Zechariah 14:9). Survivors from the non-Jewish nations flock to Jerusalem annually to observe Sukkot; those who do not are punished with drought; (14:16). 'All who survive of all those nations that came up against Jerusalem shall make a pilgrimage year by year to bow down to YHWH of Hosts and to observe the Feast of Booths.' If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we can help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.On thatdayIsrael will joina three-partyalliance with Egyptand Assyria,a blessing uponthe heart. 'The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWezbJNaVwS7ph7kAreIioAv	2024-10-24T09:32:33-07:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: There Is No Need For AUSSOM – OpEd	A seventeen-year-old operation which has not achieved its goal can only be considered a total failure, which by all standards and common sense, must be discontinued, unless the original goal was not as defined as it is and it is doing a project that is hidden and covert, and it looks likely this is probably the case. It is being renewed under a different name, the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). It is clear that it will not stabilize nor support Somalia but would be doing some other undisclosed mandate. This is the AMISOM project – an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, renamed some two years ago as the African Transition Mission in Somalia and whose mandate is ending on December 31st, 2024. It is the same mission under a different cover. All missions have been authorized by the United Nations Security Council, under again, different UN names. It started as UNSOA in 2009, standing for the United nations Organization Office for AMISOM and was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1863 (2009) to provide logistics support to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which was changed to UNSOS or the United nations Support office for Somalia, following the adoption of resolution 2628 (2022) on 31 March 2022, which brought in ATMIS in the place of AMISOM. Somalia can only be supported and stabilized by its own people and citizens but this will happen only when the malignant interventions of other countries stop, and when the Somali citizen realizes that it is time to reconcile and close the old painful pages and move on. Civil wars happen and happened in many countries. They are still happening in other countries at the time of this writing. Neighboring Ethiopia is but a great example. It appears to be going the way of Somalia over the next several decades, anyway. The current mandate of UNSOS as elaborated in the Security Council resolution 2748 (2024), will only add to the continuation of the miseries of the Somali people, whose politicians all vie to be the receiving party of the aid coming from other nations, the main culprit at the center of the problems of Somalia – the aid and grants from donor countries. Many of the local politicians have stopped working for the nation long ago and vie and compete for being the Somali parties receiving the assistance on behalf of the Somali people and pocketing it along with the UN and AU missions in the country, while the resources of the country are being exploited by others or being prepared for others to take. It is why such names as support systems and stabilization programs for Somalia do not hold any such meaning for Somalis. They know that such support has not been given to them and will not reach them anyway. So why do donor countries pay these monies to NGOs including the world’s large organizations such as the United Nations and the African Union? It is known that both organizations only fatten their administrations and have not achieved their mandates anywhere, except perhaps in the very beginning of each organization when sentimental issues were driving their creation. That they were not able to build a functioning Somali government with its policing forces, its military forces and its functioning administration throughout the country is unbelievable and unworthy of further discussion through a span of some seventeen years (17). The irony is that they still repeat that they support and stabilize Somalia, which is simply a ploy to receive donor monies and fatten their administrations and the salaries of their large staff at the expense of the Somali people. The UNSOS was to help create a Somali National Army (SNA) of some10,900 soldiers in 2013. This was expanded to be some 20,900 Somali soldiers including police forces at both the federal and state levels. But apparently this has not happened. If they have done their job, there would not have been any need for extensions or change of missions involving foreign soldiers. The terror element and terrorists in the country have increased since the entry of international forces into the country. There were no terror groups before IGADSOM, which was replaced by AMISOM and was further replaced by ATMIS and is now being replaced by AUSSOM. The terror activities only increase when the mandates of these missions are coming to an end. Is the terror and terrorism in the country a function of the presence of foreign forces in the country? It could probably and possibly be so, and if so, then there is no need to renew the mandates of these missions. There would no terror or terrorism in the country and Somalis would live with what they have. Some ask themselves how different AUSSOM could be from its predecessors? This is an irrelevant question for they would not be different. ATMIS was not different from AMISOM and AMISOM was not different from IGADSOM. UNSOS is not different from UNSOA. These are all same forces with fancy names doing the same jobs. At the end of the new forces mandate, we may still be hearing the same arguments. The argument would be the same. Somalia will need to be supported and the UN and the AU along with whatever administration is in the country at that time, will all agree to have a new force to replace AUSSOM. Another fancy name with a new abbreviation would be brought on to the table and perhaps would be approved. Why are these unworkable programs being rehashed and reshaped? It must have to do with money, which makes the world turn and spin, when it comes into the picture. The African soldiers in Somalia earn much more in Somalia than in their countries and much, much more than a Somali soldier in his own country. This is, indeed so, because they are endangering themselves on behalf of Somalis and putting their countries on the goodwill of the world’s multilateral organizations – the UN and the AU and the European Union, which pays for most missions. This is far from the truth for they do not help Somalia and Somalis and are exposed less than a poor Somali soldier who is not paid enough to feed his family and is asked to do most of the fighting in the country. The UN and the AU and the Somali government all know this! Should there have not been the presence of these foreign soldiers, there would probably be no terrorism. The terror groups use the presence of these foreign soldiers, most of them from neighboring countries, which have still many issues to grind with Somalia, as the raison d’etre for their existence. Perhaps, this should be taken seriously unless the terror groups themselves represent, as they seem to be, another face of the foreign intervention in the country, to exploit the resources of the country. In either case, there seems to be no need for AUSSOM or for that matter, any such force in Somalia. The UN and the AU both failed Somalia. They failed other countries too. The DR Congo mission is coming to an end and the Malians put an end to the UN mission there. What makes the UN believe that they can succeed in Somalia? They will not and the AU will not. Somalia and Somalis should be left alone to their wiles. They will find their way to stabilize themselves and live together as they always used to do in the leopard-colored country of theirs, in the very Horn of Africa States region. The previous missions failed for if they succeeded there would be no need for the creation of a new mission. Things would have been settled long ago and Somalia should have been standing on its feet taking into considerations the billions of United States Dollars that are claimed to have been spent on the country, which did not happen. The terror groups are still present in the country and have increased their terror activities since we are getting closer to the end of the ATMIS mandate. The international community, if it is genuinely supporting Somalia, should not approve the presence of foreign forces in the country. Somalia should be working to govern itself and make bilateral arrangements with other countries which can really help it to stand on its feet but should not seek any UN and African Union help and support. These are toothless and corrupt bureaucrats who cannot change one iota of any country. A discontinuation of the AU mission of Somalia will also put an end to the disputes between Ethiopia and Somalia and between Kenya and Somalia with respect to territorial and other claims. Each country will have to stay in its turf as per international law. Neighboring countries should never have been allowed to participate in peacemaking operations in countries with which they have a lot to grind. Kenya and Ethiopia are such countries when it comes to Somalia. It was a mistake as Kofi Annan, the Ex-UN Secretary General warned Kenya in 2011 not go into Somalia. He further noted that it is always better in peacekeeping not to use the soldiers of neighboring countries but soldiers from further afield. Kenya’s operation 'Operation Lindi Nchi' or Protect the Nation of 2011 was not in line with the United Nations charter, which prohibits the use of force in international relations. Perhaps this is what Ethiopia, another neighboring country of Somalia, is currently thinking, to invade Somalia as soon as the ATMIS mandate ends to supposedly protect its country from the terror groups which itself appears to have armed and weaponized against their own government. The AUSSOM operation to start on the first day of 2025 and last until the end of 2028, will make the AU mission in Somalia last from 2007 to 2028, a long period of failures and corruption at the very highest levels of international governance in the world. Why would a mission last that long unless there is corruption at the very highest levels?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO1SEd2L15neTHqhU8ytQd	2024-10-24T09:30:53-07:00	
How Can Security Vulnerabilities Revealed By TUSAŞ Terror Attack ...	The attack on Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ) headquarters in Ankara Kahramankazan on October 23, 2024, was seen as a serious threat to Turkey's defense industry. The tragic event, which resulted in the loss of five lives and left 22 injured, highlighted significant security failures. Senior officials emphasized that the attack directly targeted Turkey's strategic defense capabilities. Causes of the Security Lapse One of the primary issues was the hesitation of security personnel during the attack regarding how and when to respond. This uncertainty revealed a lack of adequate training and preparedness. Additionally, the delayed review of surveillance footage and the failure to activate early warning systems underscored shortcomings in the security protocols, particularly in addressing current threats. The ineffective use of technology and the absence of preventive measures before the attack pointed to a serious security gap. Recommendations for Addressing the Security Vulnerabilities Training of Security Personnel:Security staff must undergo regular training to prepare for threats. Physical and psychological resilience training, as well as developing quick decision-making and calm response skills during crises, are crucial. Technological Improvements:Security cameras and early warning systems should be upgraded with more advanced artificial intelligence-supported systems. This will make it easier to detect unusual activity before an attack and enable quicker responses to potential threats. Physical Security Measures:The security surrounding critical defense industry facilities should be enhanced. Higher walls, electronic barriers, and intrusion detection sensors can make it more difficult for potential attackers to reach the facility. Integration of Internal and External Security:Defense industry facilities should not only rely on internal security but also maintain constant communication with intelligence agencies. Sharing intelligence on terrorist threats is essential for preventing attacks before they occur. Regular Security Drills:Periodic security drills are necessary to identify and address security weaknesses. These exercises will test the readiness of personnel and evaluate the effectiveness of technological systems. Comprehensive Threat Analysis:Security policies should take a proactive approach to address not only existing threats but also potential new ones in the future. In addition to terrorist groups like the PKK, digital threats such as cyberattacks must also be considered. The TUSAŞ attack has highlighted the critical importance of securing Turkey's strategic defense facilities. Implementing these recommendations to address security gaps will ensure a safer environment for the defense industry and help prevent similar attacks in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfM_RTOEUjIGinuBJxanUmg	2024-10-24T09:29:04-07:00	
How To Think Impossibly: Towards A Scientific UFOlogy – OpEd	People believe impossible things because impossible things happen to people. You don't need to believe any of the belief systems that build up around such extraordinary experiences to acknowledge that the experiences in fact happened. If there is indeedtruth to astrology, then I think it's axiomatic that we are wittingly or otherwise in touch with other 'universals', beings from the elite of all those trillions of stars around us. Impossible? Given our Cartesian thinking, yes. The unknown otherworldiness behind any such communication—and there is lots of evidence that something unknown and otherworldy is going on—requires impossible thinking. During the past two 'scientific' centuries, but in fact going back to the time of Plato, we have accumulated a huge amount of inexplicable, impossible personal experiences of otherworldly phenomena, events. The first recorded near-death experience was told by Plato inThe Republic, the myth of Er (why 'myth'?), the account by soldier left for dead who awakens on the funeral pyre 12 days later, and gave a detailed account of his time there, much like those who survive a lightning strike or a near-death experience today. You've never heard of Er? Neither had I. Like the thousands (millions?) of UFO experiences, it is ignored, dismissed, blotted out. Our monotheisms were founded on such sightings, such 'myths' – Ezekiel's wheels, Elija's departure in a fiery chariot. Kripal tries to put some epistemological order into what to date is a junkyard straight out of a sci fi movie by Lem,Stalker II. This requires wrestling withthe nature of consciousness, belief, reality itself.All of this happens because of altered states ofconsciousness. So we begin with consciousness, which we don't understand, but can fiddle with usingpsychedelics to open a door in the mind to interact with actual entities through hallucinations.Or discipline using religious ritual. Both license and discipline can achieve states of consciousness that defy reality. 1/ Before we get to the little green men, we must deal withprecognitive events, which transform the entire order of knowledge upon which our present culture depends, the sciences included. They are well documented though left as bizarre footnotes rather than given the attention they deserve. My interest in all this is prompted by my own precognitive nightmare predicting my father's sudden death a few months later. Looking back now, it indeed transformed my life, though I was clearly moving towards these changes unconsciously. Who knows? When you have such an experience, it is one to respect. They call into question: the practice of history (time goes both ways), the history of religions (divination is globally distributed, relies on human abilities), the philosophy of mind (consciousness and cognition are not stuck in the present skull cavity or this temporal slice of a body), causality itself (agency can act from the future). linear time vs block time.i Documented testimonies from Zora Hurston (12 predictions ending with Mrs Osgood Mason), Kipling, Twain, Coleridge, Mary Shelley, Tolkien, Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Lem, Philip K Dick. Schopenhauer coinedWahrtraumen(dreaming the truth) to describe his many precognitive dreams that contained perfectly precise and banal details about the next day's events. 2/ Second on the list of weird things is lightning. There are many instances of survivors who have had an after-death experience, where they could choose to stay or return (though warned that would be painful). Coppola's Youth without Youth (1976) is based on Mircea Eliade's last novel, explaining time, consciousness, and the fantastic foundations of reality. The novel follows the life of Dominic Matei, an elderly Romanian intellectual, Eliade's hero-doppleganger, who is struck by lightning, which allows him to live a new life with startling intellectual, paranormal, capacity, anamnesis,ii instant recall. Kripal befriended one of these lightning survivors, Elizabeth Krohn, struck by lightning in 1988. She was gone two weeks in afterlife time, but only a few seconds eastern standard time. She became a celebrated children's author, and was notable for blowing out lightbulbs in her presence, getting a phone call from her deceased grandfather, and precognitive dreaming of major historical events. 3/ Lightning leads us tonear-death experiences (NDE). From Plato's Er to the popularization of climbers' testimonies in the 1890s and the explosion of literature in recent years, with better scientific equipment and knowledge of the brain providing more explanatory power. 4/ Which brings us to the little green men andabductions, visitations. This is not just a space age phenomenon. Abductions are integral to all religions. The form of alien is insectoid, the vehicles space age long before airplanes. They are too many, too intensely experienced, too similar for all to be frauds. 5/ And finally religions. Lourdes, Fatima, Our Lady of Guadaloupe, Maria do Agreda (the Lady in Blue). Islam is a world of the seen and unseen, with jinns and angels in constant communion with humans and God. To Vaeni, they are 'midwives birthing us out of our egos.'iii Left/ right hemisphere duality If anamnesis is possible for many (most? all?), then we can conceive of a new humanity with a more evolved psycho-mental life, with encyclopedic recovery of the past, through a regime of concentration which allows direct access to the wealth of information of the past. Even if this is possible only to a small adaptive elite, then these humans can be considered evolved mutants, harbingers of a new post-historic superrace. We have two domains, material and mental, mediated by the imagination. Duality got a bad name with Descartes. Mind-body, subject-object. Brain research settles the matter with left-right hemispheres as digital-analog, the left cold and rational, the right so otherworldly (holistic, pictorial, atemporal). We know now that our current dismissal of Descartes' 'ghost in the machine' to be just a bad case of throwing the baby soul-spirit out with the materialist bathwater. It turns out the bathwater doesn't even exist (in our quantum world), that the only reality we know for sure is Descartes 'I think', or rather consciousness itself, so we now must apologize to poor baby, dust him/her off and try to figure out how to educate him/her to become that inner-outer superperson, subject-object together. i.e., the bathwater gets an honorable mention.All this involves impossible thinking, reliance on imagination that is mediating, translating and expressing something superreal, surreal. The Catholics have lots of 'freakish folk', documented by fellow UFOlogist CarlosEire. They are in fact the main event, however embarrassing. Two centuries ago, before secular materialism took hold, they were mainstream, though just accepted as miracles. We still hear about such freaks, but only in scandal sheets. Think of a religious eccentric like St Teresa of Avila (d 1582), who levitated uncontrollably during mass or whenever. This ability to levitate is mentioned in one sentence in Wikipedia as if embarrassing, but is central to her life and sainthood. (She was embarrassed and prayed that it would stop, which it did.) The 17th century Fransciscan friar Joseph of Cupertino (d 1663) experienced miraculous levitation and ecstatic visions throughout his life, famously perching on delicate limbs of olive trees, which made him the object of scorn. He was rejected then reluctantly admitted to the Franciscan Order. His superiors tried to hide him away in a remote monastery but the people came to relish his miracles. He was canonized a century later, having narrowly escaping the Inquisition. Kripal suspects such weirdos see and know asif revealed to them by some other form of mind or intelligence that is also them in some paradoxical quantum sense. Such a form of mind uses the cultural bits and pieces that are lying around to express itself. Strugatsky'sRoadside Picnic,Lem'sStalker.We confuse the bits and pieces (thrown plates, flying saucers) with whatever message, meaning is intended. Lots of hermeneutics. Just as we canreconsider astrologyin our age of computers and orbiting telescopes, we can amass the thousands of weird otherworldly experiences documented and try to 'break the code', put the weirdos in context and use imaginationandreason to shape a technology that combines our mind-body duality in an all-purpose monism. The impossible emerges from a knowing place before and beyond the subject/object split, in ourAge of Separation. Towards a scientific UFOlogy We can start with 'experience' vs 'event'. There is nothing without me-us in the middle. That nonmaterial 'I-me' is now back at the center, pre-Copernicus and post-Einstein. The universe is conscious and so are we. We live in a participatory universe. The cosmos is conscious. Yikes! our tiny (but egotistical) ego protests. The impossibleness is a function not of reality but of our own present social constructions, perceptions. In reality space, time and mind are all one. Past, present and future are all one big, fat 'thing', block time, constantly interacting outside of us. Future is already present in past, just as notes of musical phrase though played successively persist together in the present and thus form a phrase. In a sense, music creates historical time. Our sense oflineartime is a neurological illusion produced as we experience ourselves moving through this eternal and unchanging spatiotemporal block, like a 4-D worm wiggling out from conception to its disappearance in death. Mystical experiences point at the truth, give the impression that past, present and future exist together in an Eternal Now. Kripal argues our nonphysical mind processes are ultimately centered on a monistic ground (Godhead?), beyond time-space, that your physical emanation is the confused, neurotic, superficial chattering time-space version of the real you. Quantum mechanics and mystical literature speak to the different sides, the same deeper reality, one 'from the outside' (physics), the other 'from the inside (mystical). Bohr and Schrodinger turned to comparative mystical literature to make human sense of what the quantum mechanics implied. Modern physics and psychics have been reflecting each other from the start. Quantumness redefines 'real'. Kevin: 'Reality is what two or more can experience together.' Subject-object, mind-matter melt away in our most elevated (or deepest) connections with the Other. The Matrix is a good starting point, where physical objects 'out there' are merely icons on the screen of our virtual reality game of perception that lets us maneuver through the world, survive, reproduce and so 'win' the game. Fitness beats truth.iv We evolved to 'win the game', not to perceive reality as it really is. The Matrixplot centers on aliens using us as a power source, a fuel, but Kripal points to some abduction experiences to suggest cold, insectoid aliens get off on our flashy inner worlds, full of very colorful flights of fancy. It is our Godlike consciousness that is so special. We are like babies with joy sticks and a hard drive beyond our ken, but now, Kripal argues, we have matured enough to do both—win the game and perceive reality as it really is—as part of a newScience of Man. Kripal sees hints of the new science not only in weird experiences, but in myths, religions, the humanities, which are in fact inspired by past weird experiences. Consciousness is not to be dismissed as an afterthought to materialist science. It is the center of our science, with our factoid obsession really only playing a subordinate role. Contact events, especially shamanic, are a passport to the cosmos, inhabiting an actual third space neither objective nor subjective. As with all scientific revolutions, a new paradigm is taking shape. Kripal uses new terms to shake us up. Learn-with, experiencers. The weird things straddle both natural science events as well as humanities-type experiences. To think impossibly is a kind of return to origins (mystery, miracles) smarter, more jaded, wiser. His mentors include Nietzsche, and Husserl with his transcendental phenomenology, not Heidegger and Sartre's material atheistic version. And Henry Corbin (d 1978), Henry James, Frederic Meyers, and Karl Jung. Corbin, through his study Iranian Shia mysticism, posited the human as bi-unity, a paradoxical complex of the conscious person and the largely unconscious, superconscious angelic twin. He combines imagination and reality, the socially active and mystically transcendent, with theangelic twin, doppleganger. We function in a material world according to a nonmaterial alter-ego (which we berate, occasionally compliment). The point ultimately is to align your mind with the universal mind. Stoicism. The outer you and its angelic twin do not always appear together in ways that we can appreciate. They work in different dimensions and scales, horizontally (in our five sense dimensions) and vertically (other dimensions, spiritual). Kripal was raised a Catholic and both deplores the Protestant reformation and the loss of the sacred that Protestantism ushered in with the Renaissance and rise of Science. Our angelic twin lost its moral compass, leaving behind only the confused chatterer. Eire documents how ruthless religions were to persecute weirdos, witches and homosexuals (50,000 witches executed gruesomely from 1400-1600), though a handful like Teresa of Avila and Joseph of Cupertino managed to dodge the bullet. He respects religion (not so much religions) as an important vehicle for the weird, but is an important figure in Esalen, where he launched his book Esalen (2008) with the subtitle America and the Religion of No Religion. 19th century romanticism reveled in a revolution of consciousness. The literature of the period was full of striving to transcend. Coleridge focused on Ezekiel's wheel in the sky. But scientism left no room and it was not until Raymond Moody's Life after Life (1975) that serious consideration began. As an undergraduate at the University of Virginia in 1965, Moody encountered psychiatrist, Dr. George Ritchie, who told Moody about an incident in which he believed he had journeyed into the afterlife while dead for nearly nine minutes at the age of 20. Life after Life became a bestseller and was translated into numerous languages. Christians were not happy as there was no hell or creedal requirement for salvation. So we witnessed the reenactment of past inquisitions, though now, without deadly consequences. Kripal is keen to formulate a new methodology, starting with *The use of altered states of consciousness as generators of a philosophy of mind and a truly scientific modeling of the physical cosmos.v *Theexperience-source hypothesis, that basic religious convictions are cultural reworkings of a recurring set of direct experiences and not just reworkings of indirect historical contexts or psychosocial constructions. Experiences are direct, embodied connection with the Real, which can be ordinary things, but perceived with heightened awareness, not our regular 5-senses surface perceptions. Whatever presences interact with humans, it is through our imagination, i.e., our consciousness. Reason is mostly impotent. Language and grammar something of a joke (Derrida). The senses are not reliable. They evolved for other much more practical and adaptive reasons. Clearly the imagination shows every sign of being capable of affecting physical objects and events, even the workings of space and time, toward some symbolic meaning or communication. *Perennialismincorporates a global phenomenology of religious experience, comparing them to determine real differences and genuine similarities. *Thegardenis a central symbol, always appearing in heightened NDEs, hinting at Eden as the Alpha where we began and the Omega whence we return, a portal, gate. *Kripal likes to'think-with'hisexperiencers, emulate, empathize, adopt, mix their thought with his. As I read, I realized why I/many are fascinated by the Middle Ages. People took for granted spirits, jinn, angels. I.e., people intuited, believed there were other forces at work than those we can 5-sense-with. Religion is an evolutionary adaptation to what are occult or hidden presences. We lost religion and our awareness of this hidden world, became the hostage of materialist science, which literally killed all the jinn when we desacrilized the universe, so we no long have access to channel them. I have always been suspicious of facts, number-crunching, as missing the point. Facts are boring, soulless, but life is exciting, full of …life! Over my lifetime, science has matured to acknowledging that weird idea. Some more ideas for a new epistemology: *Kripal asserts that laughter is essential to the new way of being/ thinking. His heroes,Stuart Davis, Jeremy Vaeni and experiencer Kevin all insist that laughter is philosophically important. It makes fun of and so transcends the silly social ego. Impossible thinking involves not just a thinking-with but also a laughing-with. *There can be no communication from a distance (tele-), much less a shared emotional entanglement (-pathos) unless something fundamental is shared, i.e.,love. A subjectivity cannot possess another subjectivity unless they share the same basic nature. The demon is human too. We intuit this in education, the teacher drawing out the unconscious knowledge, the student draws out the inspiration of the teacher, both connecting in love. *Corbin understood that theimaginal worldwas a noetic organ/place or intellectual-spiritual capacity that was mediating an actual dimension of reality, Jung'screative imagination, a mythmaking dimension of consciousness, where myth and symbol happen, where they are true, where visions occur and the spiritual body is resurrected. Aphenomenology of revelation. Humans are a bi-unity, the human person accompanied by an angelic twin who mediates between our dimension and the other(s). *A sign is a simple referent, arbitrary and ultimately meaningless, whereas asymbolparticipates in that which it expresses, an anthropomorphic hang-up, a projection, a mishmash of culturally determined signs. Gospel of Philip: Truth did not come into the world naked but in symbols and images. It is implicitly religious, revealed, supermeaningful to us. Without us/some listener listening for the symbol, there is no sound. Words are experiences. Symbols are not God, who cannot be imagined, but neither are they products of reason. They are consubstantial with the truths of which they are the conductors. Wolfson: no naked truth. truth can only appear to a human in form of an image, through a veil. Profound truths cannot be clean and clear. Only narrative, symbol, image, poetry. To insist on clarity is to replace one set of standards on another, a form of tyranny. The problem, not the solution. We need both sides of the brain firing at once and in concert, talking together through reason and imagination, rational clarity and intuitive symbol. Words are experiences. 'Real' must be 'imagined', embody meanings and subtilize the sensory thing, bring it to life. Corbin's imaginal follows Christian Docetism, that the incarnation should be treated symbolically, not literally, which agrees with the Quranic passage about how they did not really kill Jesus but another person or an appearance. Once you accept that weird is not so weird, that flying plates, crucifixion are indeed facts but we haven't figured out what theymean, that the world, world history is full of impossible things, the messy details of religions take on less import. The message is the message. The symbol is true. Kevin: Humans are analog/digital processing units for the cosmic unconscious of platonic surrealism. The digital interface was under darwinian evolution at first, but now with the modern world, it's becoming self-directed evolution. Better yet, we are like shortwave radio transmitter-receivers. There is a shared but largely unconscious experience-source hypothesis, a 'gnostic spirituality' that is universal. Different sets of cultural materials resonate so strongly because they are all based on the same kinds of human experiences, which themselves correlate very strongly with a shared neurobiology or human mind.vi The right hemisphere mediates Mind to the left hemisphere which constructs and projects the rational ego as a still-evolving and now self-directed cosmic interface. We must move back to right hemisphere-dominant as at birth. The otherworldy role of brain is to mediate and translate Mind. This is how one becomes the universe, because one already is the universe.vii If you manage to go offline, turn your whiny social ego off, then a deeper or higher form of being might appear (Real Awareness) entirely independent of your biology. Awareness of the whole by the whole. Awareness as the fundament, the ground of impossible thinking. But too much of this and you are a nutcase, schizo, autistic. That's why 'God hides.' Platonic surrealism: Platonic for insistence on a deeper level of truth and reality, surreal for the wildly symbolic, irrational, nonrational, and playful ways it expresses its endless possibilities.viii Vaeni suggests that the aliens might be us from another time, dropping in to help out, with hints that the laws of physics are not really laws 'but actually mere suggestions.'ix Guardian angels? He excuses their flying plates as happening from different times, 'coming into space and time from outside space and time.' We need to think of time hermeneutically, block time (me/you from dust to dust), stop blocking out meaning 'with our crap including our intellectual crap.'x Vaeni thinks that we speak and imagine the aliens into existence. We let them in, as it were. This is about as hermeneutical as it gets: they are real, and they are here because we believe they are here. We speak them into existence, so that they can speak us out of existence.xi As for the practicality of Kripal's project, the idea of an elite superperson (thank you Neitzsche) makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. Nature is full of hierarchy and misfits. The most intriguing in human society is the stable 5% of males who end up homosexual. Hardly an elite, but the evolutionary purpose still defies explanation. Other misfits, also more for the more complex males, include schizophrenia, color blindness, autism. Are these just faulty evolution or do they have hidden meaning? Kripal focuses on autism as a possible evolutionary step towards nonhuman intelligence, devoid of messy emotions. Again, not all autistics, as there are many reasons for autism. He speculates about the rocketing rates of autism coinciding with the sharp rise of alien abduction experiences. Finally, for those of us who can't boast of possessing direct gnosis,xii we can still use our intellect, hermeneutical sympathy to others and texts, to explore our dreams, relish the gnostic experiences and mystical thoughts of past experiencers, ponder the magical unknown as our own dark matter/ energy that we can't usually see but that influences us, begin to believe again in our spiritual guardians, our local aliens, speak them into existence. My favorite Kripal 'proofs': Re little green men, in Zimbabwe in 1994, the otherworldly craft and its alien occupants appeared to a group of more than 60 racially diverse school children (no abductions). There's a documentary Ariel Phenomenon (2022) linking it to their African ancestors. Re time travel, John Allison. Saw male in red shorts outside his basement window at night. Voice in head 'you're going to be okay.' 4 yrs later after illness, depression, feeling better, saw light in apt as he came home and saw his younger self inside. He remembered his vision and came up to the window and sent him that feeling of love and comfort. Consciousness is expansive. Here a meaningful sign of a future form of consciousness trying to take shape. Re telepathy, Karin Austin. Her vision ended in an abandoned theme park, the opening in the trees and an old rollercoaster. She later found it in Connecticut with Google maps. It was closed 1992-4. Her vision in 1993. Another unrelated person also saw the same theme park. The imagined is the real. Superphyiscal in hyperdimenionsal ways that we cannot imagine with the three dimensions in which our brains and cognitive capacities have evolved and to which we have culturally adapted.xiii Endnotes: i Time and space is/are not 'out there'. Everything is happening over and over in block time. One gigantic deja vu. i.e., deja vu is a hint at block time. The future sometimes flows back into the present as a kind of apparitional self-guiding adjustment of the meanings of history. ii Originally referring to remembering past lives, but Kripal uses more broadly as 'reading without reading''.

Ottawa’s Path Forward: Are US-Driven Tariffs Undermining Canada’s...	Canada’s decision to impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, with 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum to follow, reflects a critical moment in Sino-Canadian relations. From Beijing’s perspective, these measures are not merely economic sanctions - they represent a broader alignment of Canadian policies with those of the United States. Historically, Canada had pursued a more diversified trade policy, leveraging China’s economic rise to reduce its reliance on U.S. markets. But recent actions indicate a significant shift. Ever since the U.S. scrapped NAFTA in favor of the USMCA, Canada has increasingly copied American policy, especially regarding China. These tariffs, echoing Washington’s protectionist stance, further solidify Canada’s dependency on U.S. policy directions, rather than forging an independent path in its dealings with China. China’s Ministry of Commerce has called on the WTO to investigate, but the broader question remains - how long will Canada prioritize U.S. interests over its own strategic autonomy? For China, the Trudeau government’s actions are part of a larger geopolitical maneuver, one that risks not only trade relations but Canada’s broader global standing. In this increasingly multipolar world, can Canada afford to be seen as an extension of U.S. policy, particularly when it comes to a powerhouse like China? Canada’s decision to align with the U.S. on tariffs against Chinese electric vehicles, under the urging of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, is a troubling signal for Beijing. While Canada's deep economic ties with the U.S. are undeniable, the speed with which Ottawa complied reveals a dangerous erosion of its autonomy in foreign policy. In a world where diversification is key to economic resilience, Canada's mirroring of Washington’s trade policy is particularly questionable. From China’s perspective, these tariffs - meant to 'protect' Canadian manufacturers from supposedly unfair Chinese competition - are little more than a knee-jerk response to American pressure. The tariffs, especially on electric vehicles, are not just economically unsound but strategically harmful. They expose Canada’s much smaller economy to retaliation, without the cushion of a diversified trade portfolio. Experts within Canada's own auto industry are already warning that these measures will backfire, leading to higher costs and diminished market access. Moreover, Canada’s embrace of the U.S. strategy of securitizing economic policy raises further concerns. This practice, which frames trade disputes as national security issues, risks neither bolstering Canada’s security nor enhancing its economic prosperity. Instead, it locks Canada into a punitive approach that diminishes its bargaining power and complicates future diplomatic engagements. For China, the question is simple: why should we engage with a country that so readily follows another’s lead? Canada must reconsider if this path truly serves its long-term national interest. Canada’s decision to impose heavy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles reveals much about its shifting allegiances and the precarious balancing act it now faces. While its economic dependence on the U.S. cannot be easily severed, the eagerness with which Ottawa followed Washington’s lead raises eyebrows. From Beijing’s perspective, this move is as much about U.S. electoral politics as it is about trade. Beyond politics, Canada’s ambitions to foster its own electric vehicle industry appear misguided. The notion of replicating industries within national borders is a relic of a bygone era. Since the Second World War, major industrialized nations - including China - have thrived by specializing in certain sectors, benefiting from economies of scale. Canada’s attempt to conjure up a homegrown EV industry from scratch, especially in the face of established giants like China, seems an uphill battle, if not outright folly. China’s dominance in electric vehicles is the result of years of patient, strategic investment - a competitive edge that other nations simply cannot replicate. Canada, instead of attempting to challenge this supremacy, would be wiser to cultivate its own strengths in other high-tech industries. By trying to imitate China, Ottawa risks squandering its resources on a losing battle. If the Trudeau government truly aims to protect Canada’s industrial sector, it must reconsider its broader tariff strategy. Plans to target products like solar cells, computer chips, and lithium-ion batteries will choke vital supply chains, drive up costs, and potentially lead to job losses - only deepening the country's industrial decline. From Beijing’s perspective, Canada’s move on EVs is not just a policy misstep, but a potential setback in the fight against climate change. Tariffs that make electric vehicles more expensive will only delay Canadians from replacing gas-powered cars, ultimately undermining global climate goals. For China, it’s clear: Canada’s economic and environmental strategies are heading down a perilous road. Meanwhile, China has achieved something that deserves recognition. Through deliberate policies, it has raised the living standards of millions of workers and made strides toward environmental sustainability - both within its borders and through its global initiatives. In contrast, Canada’s newly imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles seem to do little more than undermine its own interests. These tariffs won’t strengthen Canadian sovereignty, help its workforce, or revive its struggling industrial sector. If anything, they will push Canada further down the road of dependency and economic vulnerability. Even more concerning, from China’s vantage point, is the impact these actions could have on the fight against climate change. By making electric vehicles less affordable, Canada risks stalling progress on one of the most urgent issues of our time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9NjcPzvhvkqXA	2024-10-24T09:24:35-07:00	
From Colonial Legacies To Contemporary Strategic Evolution Of Ind...	The Indian ocean spreads all the way south to Antarctica, covering almost 27 percent of the maritime space of the world and 14 percent of the total globe. It is described as a water-body between Africa,the Antarctic Ocean, Asia, and Australia. For centuries, the Indian Ocean Region has been a great spectator of the fall and rise of civilizations, various empires including the Phoenicians, the Arabs, the Chinese, and the Portuguese-as an eternal quest for spices, textiles and precious stones. The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has a long history of cultural exchange, dating back over 4,000 years before the Vikings' arrival in North America. The region has been a hub of trade activity, both coastal and transoceanic, since around 5000 BC. By the start of the common era (CE), ancient port cities like Berenike and Hormos on the Red Sea had established significant trade connections with India, facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas across the region. The ancient Sassanian Empire's patronage (224-651) propelled Persian traders to dominance in the Gulf and Western Indian Ocean, their mercantile prowess rivaled only by the seafaring Arabs. The Arabs' extensive reach spanned India, East Africa, and the East Indies, a testament to their maritime expertise. However, the Sassanian dynasty's downfall at the hands of Muslim Arabs between 637-651 marked a turning point. The Arabs' commercial ascendancy peaked in the 9th century, with Ceylon and Calicut emerging as crucial entrepots, bridging the eastern and western oceanic trade routes. Vasco de Gama, was a Portuguese navigator whose voyage to India between 1497-99 and 1502-03 opened up a sea route from Western Europe to the East, by way of Cape of Good Hope. This pioneering feat heralded a new epoch in world history, as the Portuguese navigator was elevated to the esteemed rank of Admiral in 1502. The arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean marked the dawn of a new era, as they established themselves as the first Europeans to set foot in this realm. Their intentions were clear: to assert economic dominance over the coveted Asian trade, with a particular penchant for pepper and spices. Fuelled by an animosity towards the Muslims, the Portuguese embarked on a strategic conquest, claiming key ports such as Colombo, Socotra, Goa, Melaka, Hormuz, and Diu between 1505 and 1535. This calculated expansion enabled them to wield control over the Indian Ocean's trade, imposing licenses, customs duties, and stringent regulations on merchandise. The Portuguese grip was unyielding, dictating the flow of commerce and stifling the aspirations of rival nations. The Portuguese monopoly was a goldmine, flooding their coffers with wealth as they exploited Europe's craving for Asian spices. It also allowed them to simultaneously sideline Muslim traders who had thus far been dominating regional trade. The markets dealing with these commodities namely Aden, Jeddah, Basra, Cairo,Alexandria, Aleppo, Sofala, Hormuz, Diu and Melaka, consequently fell into decline. By early 17th century, however the Portuguese hold in the IOR was in shreds, dwindling rapidly as they lost major ports including Cochin and Colombo. As the 16th century drew to a close, the Dutch astutely capitalized on the burgeoning opportunities in the Indian Ocean, inaugurating their mercantile endeavors in this lucrative region. In 1604, they forged a strategic alliance with the Zamorin, the venerable Emperor of Malabar, united in their quest to expel the entrenched Portuguese presence. Recognizing the formidable Portuguese stronghold at pivotal locations, the Dutch devised a sagacious plan to establish a foothold in Java, whence they would launch a concerted effort to infiltrate and dismantle the Portuguese dominion. The Dutch mercantile agenda was singularly focused on the coveted spice trade, encompassing cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and nutmeg. The establishment of the Dutch East India Company in 1602 was a deliberate measure to regulate intra-Dutch competition, mitigating the uneven distribution of profits garnered from the lucrative Indian spice trade. State encouragement prompted merchants to consolidate their resources, culminating in the grant of a trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean to the Dutch East India Company. Following their conquest of Malacca in 1641, the Dutch allied themselves with the formidable King of Ceylon, collaborating to vanquish the Portuguese. The culmination of this campaign was the protracted siege of Colombo by the Dutch fleet, ultimately resulting in its capitulation in 1654. The French, thwarted in their attempts to gain a foothold in Ceylon in 1670 against the indomitable Dutch, redirected their ambitions towards the fertile shores of Madagascar and Mauritius. The French fleet saw it’s best days under Admira de Suffren in 1782-84. During this epoch, the French forged a strategic alliance with the redoubtable Hyder Ali, supporting his Carnatic Campaigns - a series of epic struggles that convulsed the 18th century, as the British, French, Marhatas, and Mysore vied for dominance over the coveted coastal strip. Subsequently, French also managed to capture Trincomalee port in Sri Lanka. As the 18th century dawned, the once-mighty Mughal Empire began to exhibit fissures, its grandeur slowly succumbing to the ravages of time. The decline of Mughal Empire and the rise of British in India, amongst other fates is attributable to the former’s obsession landward concerns. Their obsession with terrestrial conquests led them to neglect the vast expanse of Indian shores, forsaking the strategic advantages afforded by their extensive coastline. This shortsightedness, aptly described as 'sea blindness', afflicted not only the ruling elite but also large swaths of the population, leaving them oblivious to the maritime future. This vacuum enabled outside powers with strong commercial interests and potent navies to exploit the subcontinental riches and thus establish a foothold in India. The English and French commenced their Indian Ocean trading activities in the wake of Dutch. Following the Dutch example, they set their own East India Companies in 1600 and 1664 respectively. The Dutch East India Company, like Portuguese desired control of spice and pepper trade. Dutch were initially more successful than British East India Company. The two had dissimilarity as well. While the Dutch East India Company concentrated on in-country and inter Asian Trade, the British East India focused on trade to Europe. Using the seapower effectively, the British gradually built up their land power, through Madras in 1749 and Bengal in 1756. The Napoleonic wars in Europe helped the British take over Ceylon, Java, Malacca and the Cape from Dutch and French possessions, especially Mauritius, from the French. The ports of Madras, Bombay and Calcutta were established by British in mid to late 17th Century to wean the transoceanic trade away from traditional port cities. Despite careful application of coercion to attract Asian traders, it still look a good seventy odd years to Bombay to become more formidable than its neighbouring port Surat. By 1800, another commodity tea had entered the trade market in a big way. British exported opium (cultivated in Bihar, East India) to China in return for tea. This trade and its revenge grew sharply with a rise in tea consumption throughout the European Market. After setting up factories in port cities, the British proceeded to set these further inland near the production centres. It sent the clear message that the British were in it for the long haul. The advent of steamships and opening of the Suez Canal (1869) were two major developments that transformed trading patterns in the region by shortening the time and distances involved. Moving on the trail of timeline, 20th century witnessed the birth of two new yet currently regional stakeholders of Indian Ocean - Pakistan and India. In contemporary world shaped by China – U.S. power struggle, the pursuit of control over the Indian Ocean and its crucial trade routes has significantly elevated its strategic significance. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a physical demonstration how Beijing is building up infrastructure and gradually expanding its presence in its surrounding regions, particularly Indian Ocean Region (IOR). To protect its economic interests in Indian Ocean, China is gradually increasing its naval capabilities and outreach. In essence, as the tides of the time continue to shift, the region’s importance remains constant, beckoning new stakeholders to its shores.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9NmgdGGFF4uP9	2024-10-24T09:21:26-07:00	
Sustaining Peace: Pakistan’s UN Engagement – OpEd	On October 24th, the world comes together to celebrate the founding of the United Nations (UN) and to reflect on the core principles that have shaped global governance for nearly eight decades. UN Day marks the anniversary of the entry into force of the UN Charter in 1945, a monumental moment that established a framework for international cooperation in an increasingly interconnected world. In 2024, the theme 'The Future We Want; the UN We Need! Reaffirming Our Collective Commitments to Multilateralism' serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of global solidarity and cooperation in addressing the challenges that lie ahead. UN Day is more than a celebration; it is a reaffirmation of the global community’s shared values of peace, justice, human rights, and sustainable development. As the UN navigates new challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and growing inequality, this day allows the world to reflect on how multilateralism can address these complex issues. The UN's foundational purpose, as enshrined in its Charter, is to prevent conflicts, promote peace, and protect the rights and dignity of people everywhere. Over the years, the organization has served as a platform for dialogue, bringing together nations to discuss and resolve pressing global concerns. Today, in a world that is more interconnected than ever, the relevance of the UN cannot be overstated. The organization's commitment to 'leaving no one behind' resonates deeply as nations grapple with issues that transcend borders, such as climate change, terrorism, and public health crises. Multilateralism is the key to achieving the collective goals of peace, security, and prosperity for all. Since joining the UN in 1947, Pakistan has consistently advocated for peace, security, and cooperation. Its foreign policy has been deeply rooted in the principles of multilateralism, emphasizing the need for collective global efforts to address challenges ranging from conflict resolution to sustainable development. Pakistan's active participation in UN forums and initiatives highlights its belief in the power of diplomacy and international cooperation to foster global harmony. One of Pakistan's most significant contributions to the UN is its role in peacekeeping operations. As one of the largest troop-contributing countries, Pakistan has deployed more than 235,000 troops to 48 missions across 29 countries. Pakistani peacekeepers have operated in some of the most dangerous conflict zones, consistently demonstrating bravery and professionalism. Their efforts have been pivotal in stabilizing war-torn societies, maintaining law and order, and enabling successful political transitions. Currently, over 2,600 Pakistani peacekeepers are deployed in seven UN missions, contributing as part of infantry battalions, engineering companies, aviation units, artillery batteries, and as military staff officers and observers. The spirit of sacrifice shown by Pakistani peacekeepers, with 181 having laid down their lives in the line of duty, underscores Pakistan's unwavering commitment to global peace. Pakistan’s dedication to the peaceful resolution of disputes has been a central tenet of its foreign policy. This is evident in its longstanding advocacy for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute in line with UN Security Council resolutions. Pakistan has consistently emphasized the need for diplomatic solutions to conflicts and has played an active role in promoting peace in various international forums. The country believes that the UN remains the most legitimate platform for conflict resolution and global diplomacy, and it continues to call for stronger multilateral efforts to address unresolved conflicts. Despite facing challenges, such as the shrinking space for peacekeeping operations due to changing global dynamics, Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the UN’s peacekeeping agenda. The country’s troops have played an integral role in normalizing societies that have been torn apart by war, ensuring that law and order are restored and that political processes can proceed in a stable environment. This commitment reflects Pakistan’s belief in the UN’s ability to prevent conflicts, protect civilians, and maintain peace through collective efforts. Pakistan is not only a proponent of peace but also a strong advocate for the UN's 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a developing country facing its own challenges, including poverty, inequality, and energy insecurity, Pakistan has made significant strides in integrating the SDGs into its national development agenda. The country recognizes that achieving sustainable development requires a concerted effort from all nations and continues to push for global cooperation in areas such as poverty eradication, quality education, gender equality, and clean energy. Moreover, Pakistan is a vocal advocate for reforms within the UN to ensure that global governance structures are more inclusive and representative of the modern world. The current imbalances in political and economic power in international institutions are a cause for concern, and Pakistan has consistently called for just and equitable reforms. It stresses that reform should not only benefit a few powerful member states but should include the voices of smaller, less developed nations. This aligns with Pakistan's broader vision for a more equitable and just international order, where marginalized populations are empowered and included in global decision-making processes. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for global cooperation in addressing transnational threats. Pakistan played a proactive role during the pandemic, advocating for equitable access to vaccines and financial support for developing nations. The pandemic demonstrated that no country, regardless of its wealth or resources, can tackle global challenges alone. Pakistan supports the idea that multilateral institutions like the UN are critical platforms for shared responsibility and joint action in the face of challenges such as pandemics, climate change, and international terrorism. As the world faces the growing threat of climate change, Pakistan is increasingly vocal about the need for global cooperation to mitigate its impacts. The country has already experienced the devastating effects of climate-related disasters, such as floods and droughts, and recognizes that climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution. Pakistan remains committed to working with the international community to address these and other emerging challenges, reaffirming its belief in the power of multilateralism to build a better future for all. On this UN Day, Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to the principles of multilateralism, cooperation, and collective action. The world is facing unprecedented challenges, but through institutions like the UN, there is hope for a safer, more equitable, and sustainable future. As a staunch advocate of peace, diplomacy, and sustainable development, Pakistan remains dedicated to working with the global community to achieve the goals of peace, security, and prosperity for all. It is through multilateralism that we can build 'The Future We Want' and ensure 'The UN We Need,' making the world a better place for generations to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9NtzgQoCiBi-s	2024-10-24T09:19:32-07:00	
Pakistan’s UN Voyage – OpEd	As we observe United Nations Day, it is crucial to reflect on the significant contributions made by Pakistan to the UN and its mission to foster global peace and stability. Since joining the UN in 1947, Pakistan has not only embraced the principles articulated in the UN Charter but has also taken a proactive stance in addressing global challenges. Through extensive involvement in peacekeeping missions, steadfast advocacy for human rights, and commitment to humanitarian efforts, Pakistan exemplifies a nation dedicated to fostering a safer, more equitable world. This commitment is particularly evident in Pakistan’s robust participation in UN peacekeeping efforts. This journey in UN peacekeeping began in 1960 during the Congo Crisis, marking its first deployment in a multinational peacekeeping mission. Over the decades, Pakistan has deployed more than 235,000 peacekeepers to 48 missions worldwide, establishing itself as one of the largest troop-contributing countries (TCCs) to UN operations. As of 2024, approximately 8,200 Pakistani personnel are actively engaged in peacekeeping missions, underscoring the nation’s unwavering resolve to stabilize conflict-affected regions. In 2023, Pakistan sent 1,600 peacekeepers to various missions, contributing to operations in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mali. The diversity of Pakistan's peacekeeping contingents—comprising infantry battalions, engineering units, aviation squadron, and military observers—illustrates its comprehensive approach to peacekeeping. This versatility enables Pakistan to address various facets of peacekeeping, ranging from combat to humanitarian assistance. However, this dedication has not come without sacrifice; 181 Pakistani personnel have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty, defending civilians and upholding UN mandates. Their bravery resonates not only within Pakistan but is also acknowledged internationally, highlighting the risks that peacekeepers face in the pursuit of global security. Moreover, Pakistan takes pride in promoting the role of women in peacekeeping. Over 500 Pakistani women have served in various missions, and the country was one of the first to achieve the UN's target of ensuring at least 15% female staff officers in peacekeeping contingents. This commitment to gender equality has garnered recognition from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who praised Pakistan as a leader in advancing the role of women in peacekeeping. Pakistan's influence extends beyond its peacekeeping efforts. The nation has been elected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) five times, advocating for critical human rights issues, including the rights of children, women, and minorities, while persistently drawing attention to the humanitarian crisis in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. In 2023, Pakistan urged the international community to take notice of the human rights violations and state-sponsored terrorism in this region. In addition to its advocacy within the HRC, Pakistan has presided over the UN Security Council on multiple occasions, most recently in January 2023. During this term, Pakistan prioritized discussions on regional peace and security, particularly concerning Afghanistan and the Kashmir conflict​. This leadership role has enabled Pakistan to shape key global security discussions and advocate for the perspectives and needs of developing nations. Pakistan is also a staunch advocate for disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, reflecting its commitment to a secure global environment. Engaging in dialogues that promote collective security, especially within South Asia's unique security landscape, Pakistan actively supports the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and advocates for nuclear disarmament​. Furthermore, the country is dedicated to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), implementing initiatives aimed at eradicating poverty, promoting gender equality, and ensuring access to quality education, aligning with its objectives of sustainable development​. Beyond peacekeeping, Pakistan has played a vital role in humanitarian aid and crisis response, offering assistance during global emergencies, such as the Ebola outbreak, and contributing to humanitarian efforts in Yemen and Syria​. Pakistan's commitment to the Palestinian cause is evident as it consistently advocates for Palestinian rights and addresses the humanitarian crises resulting from Israeli occupation. Alongside this, Pakistan has been a vocal supporter of the Kashmiri people's plight, framing their struggle within the context of international law and human rights. Pakistan has solidified its reputation as a responsible member of the international community, dedicated to promoting peace, security, and humanitarian well-being on a global scale through these multifaceted contributions. Its proactive engagement in diverse UN initiatives not only bolsters its international standing but also sets a powerful example for other nations striving toward similar goals. On this United Nations Day, Pakistan’s longstanding commitment to peacekeeping serves as a testament to its dedication to global stability and cooperation. By actively embracing its responsibilities and participating in peacekeeping efforts, Pakistan exemplifies how nations can collaborate to tackle common challenges. As global conflicts persist, Pakistan’s proactive approach to peace and justice remains essential, reflecting its unwavering resolve to contribute to a more harmonious future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9NuOMCyjc_4aQ	2024-10-24T09:17:49-07:00	
Regionalism Of The New Era: A Community Of Shared Future Between ...	Nationalism, regionalism and globalism are three paramount forces in contemporary international relations. But regionalism has experienced tremendous resurgence with the formation of old and new regionalism. Old regionalism started in Europe after the Second World War with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the forerunner of European Economic Community (EEC) that has evolved into the present-day European Union (EU). During the cold war, European regionalism inspired previously-colonized states in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and beyond to also form their own regional groupings for purposes of economic cooperation and even integration while protecting their political freedom and national sovereignty. Arguably, the most successful regional organization outside of Europe is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which at present is at the driver’s seat of many regional efforts in the Asia Pacific and even Indian Ocean regions. Old regionalism of the cold war was based on Western model exported to other regions of the world. There was a thought during that time that mimicking European style of regionalism was the best model for other regions to promote world peace and achieve regional prosperity. Old regionalism of Europe emphasized economic integration through free trade leading to social, cultural, political and even security integration by upholding Western values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. While old regionalism may have worked in Europe, it became problematic when practiced in other regions. Thus, a new type of regionalism emerged in Asia after the end of the cold war. Compared with the old regionalism of Europe, which is restrictive and exclusive, the new regionalism of Asia is more open and inclusive leading to the creation of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and other similar regional undertakings. While the old regionalism of Europe is driven by the interests of major powers seeking peace and prosperity through economic integration and political homogenization, the new regionalism of Asia is driven by the interests of developing states seeking peace and prosperity through development cooperation, political coordination, mutual respects, common benefits, peaceful coexistence and decolonization. The new regionalism of Asia attracted the attention of old regionalism in Europe leading to current process of inter-regionalism. But another regionalism has developed in the 21st century championed by China with the Global South. I call this as the 'Regionalism of the New Era' or the RNE. Like the new regionalism of Asia, the RNE provides an alternative to the old regionalism of Europe. But the RNE embraces the many ideas of the new regionalism of the developing world and learns lessons from the old regionalism of developed countries, especially in Europe. The RNE is the regionalism of the Global South and emerging economies with China as the main driving force. The creation of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the first indication of the rise the RNE. The BRI upholds a model of regionalism that connects Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime trade regardless of economic status, level of political development, socio-cultural make-up and religious preferences. The BRI is an open and inclusive mega-region that aims to promote sustainable economic development through inter-regional connectivity with states initially in Asia, Africa and Europe and now encompassing Latin America and the Pacific regions. The BRI originally represents around 75 percent of the global population covering initially 60 countries during its infancy but now covering more than 150 countries and international organizations. As such, the BRI has become the RNE of the Global South. The World Bank reports that by 2030, the BRI will create a yearly growth of US$1.6 trilllion to the world’ s economy. But other estimates say that the BRI can boost world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $US7 trillion annually by 2040. Whatever the estimates are, the BRI aims to develop regional infrastructures, enhance regional economic activities, raise peoples’ income, and contribute to the reduction of global poverty. The BRI is being bankrolled by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) now headquartered in Beijing. Another strong indication of the rise of RNE is the establishment of the BRICS originally founded by emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa representing 30 percent of the world’s land area, 45 percent of the global population and more than 30 percent of global GDP. BRICS has expanded to other emerging economies of Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Many countries from the Global South like Algeria, Bolivia, Cuba, Turkiye Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and others have applied for BRICS membership because of its huge potential to bring prosperity to its members and raise the quality of life of their peoples. BRICS has the New Development Bank (NDB) in Shanghai. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is also an indication of the RNE. In terms of geography and demography, the SCO is one of the world’s largest regional groupings of states representing 42 percent of the world population and 24 percent of the global land area. Compared with BRICS and the BRI, the SCO has a strong security agenda while pursuing economic cooperation. From original members of five composed of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, the SCO has extended to five other permanent members to include Belarus, India, Iran, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Other countries from Central Asia, Eurasia and South Asia have applied for accession to the SCO. Since the RNE is the regionalism of the Global South and the emerging economies, China has enunciated another idea that reinforces this type of regionalism to the international society by building a community of shared future for mankind. The goal of building a community of shared future is upholding the fundamental tenet of RNE by establishing an open and inclusive community of the peoples of the world through common development and shared prosperity; common, cooperative and sustainable security; and, harmony of all civilizations. China’s Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI), and Global Civilization Initiative (GCI) are China’s three global initiatives that support the RNE and even the United Nation’s campaign for a Better World, which is consistent with China’s vision of a community of shared future for mankind. Comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Southeast Asian countries is the cornerstone of the RNE. The success of China-Southeast Asia regional cooperation is important to inspire success in other regions in the Global South. In fact. existing evidences show that deeper economic integration between China and Southeast Asian countries can fuel Asian growth that is essential for global economic development. Even the New York-based Mckinsey Global Institute admits that a regionalized Asia through greater China-Southeast Asia integration serves at the hub of the global trade. Asia now accounts around 60 percent of world’s trade growth fueled by stronger China-Southeast Asia economic relations. It is therefore imperative for China and Southeast Asia to enhance their comprehensive strategic partnership to sustain its positive contribution to global economic development. A community of shared future between China and Southeast Asia is vital for the building of a community of shared future for all mankind. The ASEAN-China Free Trade Area and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) involving China, ASEAN countries, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand can accelerate Asian growth for global prosperity and peace. The RCEP is another expression of the RNE involving China, Southeast Asia and other members towards a community of shared future.

Moscow’s Anti-Migrant Campaign Accelerating Formation Of Ethnic G...	Prior to the Russian Revolution in 1917, Russian cities had ethnic quarters, or ghettos, where members of some minorities lived to maintain their ethnic identities and protect themselves against Russification. Between 1917 and 1991, such ghettos largely disappeared as a result of Soviet policies such as the propiska system, which allowed officials to determine who lived where. Following 1991, the propiska system was formally banned, and neighborhoods began gradually separating themselves again. Russian officials continue to insist that their country does not have any ghettos. In recent years, however, research and reality have forced them to acknowledge that there are, in fact, 'ethnic enclaves,' a euphemism for ghettos, a word few are prepared to use (Window on Eurasia, February 23, 2023). The influx of migrant workers from Central Asia and the Caucasus into Russian cities has subsequently caused growing anger among the population and policies against immigrant workers. As a result, real ghettos have emerged in Russian cities, exacerbating tensions between their residents and the surrounding Russian community and creating conditions in which tensions spill over into violence that even the increasingly repressive Putin regime is finding difficult to subdue (see EDM, May 9, 15). Most discussions about the reappearance of ghettos in Russian cities have suggested this development is simply the result of slums transforming into ghettos, a process in which poorer migrants replace ethnic Russian residents in poorer parts of urban areas (Natsional’nyi Aktsent, February 2, 2023). There can be little doubt that this is the primary factor in the recent rise of ghettos in Russian cities. It is increasingly evident, however, that this issue has been exacerbated by Moscow’s anti-immigrant campaign and how Russian officials and the Russian population have responded. This includes not only refusing to rent to migrants but also educators’ and parents’ attitudes toward the increasing number of migrants’ children in schools who do not know Russian well (Window on Eurasia, May 29, 2016). A common narrative is that their presence has the effect of slowing the education for others, leading to declines in all-important test scores—upon which teachers’ and administrators’ salaries depend (RIA Novosti, April 8, 2021; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, April 12, 2021; Zavtra.ru, April 14, 2021). Declining test scores have led to calls by some Russian nationalists that the children of immigrants be excluded from Russian public schools. These appeals have been dismissed as political grandstanding from parties that would like to expel all migrant workers from Russia, something that the Kremlin cannot afford to do. Such dismissals, however, have failed to recognize that these attitudes are already having an effect, keeping immigrant children from attending many schools. This is such a politically explosive topic that few studies have been conducted on how ghettoization is affecting urban life in Russia. One study on the situation in St. Petersburg recently released by Russian independent news agency Bumaga provides the clearest indication of just how far ghettoization has progressed. The study found that the situation was developing due to political reasons connected to anti-immigrant campaigns, rather than for economic ones. These campaigns have been carried out in response to a call from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) to strip children without Russian citizenship of the right to free public education (TASS, September 5). The Bumaga investigation found that in the wake of the Crocus City Hall bombing in March 2024, many Russian public schools are now refusing to admit immigrant children, citing overcrowding or other more spurious reasons. This has led to younger immigrant children being concentrated in certain schools and, in numerous cases, older immigrant children not attending at all, being left to their own devices on the streets (Bumaga, October 17). Both of these consequences,Bumagaresearchers conclude, are leading to the rapid ghettoization of immigrants, to an even slower adaptation of migrant children to Russian life, and perhaps most disturbingly of all, to the emergence of sometimes violent and often fanatically politically radical youth culture (seeEDM, March 22, 2018). While there are fewer immigrants to Russia now than in the past, the problems they pose are growing. This conclusion is supported by reports concerning increasing clashes between migrant youth and their Russian counterparts and even the formation of militias by each group to defend against the other (Svobodnaya Pressa, July 24, 2021;Window on Eurasia, September 15, 2023). Despite these risks, there is broad support both within the educational system and by the ethnic Russian majority for exclusionary policies, according toBumaga. As previously stated, schools, teachers, and parents of non-immigrant children support excluding immigrant children because their presence means that teachers have to devote more attention and time to those who do not know Russian well. This redirection of educators’ attention means that all get relatively less preparation for government-tested subjects—something which is already sparking calls for the number of immigrant children to be limited to only a handful in each class. As discussed earlier, school directors and teachers’ pay is threatened by a lower average score on said tests, which likewise determine other students’ opportunities to move on to higher education. As a result of this, there is a large group of people whose interests oppose admitting children of non-citizenship immigrants to schools. The solution in the educational system, activists and experts tellBumaga, is to establish special schools for immigrants to provide them with the Russian language education they need if they are to remain in Russia. Some acknowledge, however, that there is a danger to setting up such schools, as it could also lead to further ghettoization. While there are no statistics available on how large either of these trends has become due to its controversy,Bumagasuggests that both are large and growing. The issue is expected to negatively impact migrant and non-migrant children in schools and Russian society overall. In the broader problem of ghettoization, migrant children play only a small part, but the Putin regime has been presented with a Hobson’s choice about migrant workers. On the one hand, the Kremlin recognizes that Russia cannot afford to expel migrants or their children. On the other hand, the Putin leadership has yet to develop a strategy to curb the growth of ghettos and the violence their rise may provoke, especially amid the increasingly nationalist attitudes among the Russian population. Relying solely on repression—a tactic that proved ineffective in controlling such conflicts during the late imperial period—is unlikely to succeed in the current crisis (on that history and that prospect, seeEDM, October 15).

Turkish Intelligence In The New Era: Transformation And Expansion...	By John Hatzadony and Spyrion Plakoudas Turkish foreign policy has undergone fundamental change under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Less understood is the rise of the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) as a tool of Turkish foreign policy. The expanded scope and sophistication of Turkey’s intelligence and clandestine1 operations have become integral to its foreign and security policy. This paper examines how clandestine intelligence operations have increasingly become a tool of and reflect Turkey’s evolving geopolitical position. Finally, it examines the implications these increased clandestine activities have for regional and international dynamics and highlights the critical interplay between enhanced intelligence activities and Turkish foreign policy objectives. Historical Context of Turkish Intelligence The story of Turkish intelligence, tracing its origins from the late Ottoman Empire to its sophisticated contemporary operations, reflects Turkey’s complex history. The Turkish intelligence community can trace its roots as far back as 1299 to the early administrative organs of the Ottoman Empire. The empire’s intelligence apparatus was primarily centered around the general administration department, known as the divan-i hümayun kalemi (Imperial Chancery). The divan-i hümayun kalemi was primarily focused on gathering intelligence on foreign powers and internal threats.2 In the waning years of the Ottoman Empire, various attempts to reform and make relevant the intelligence capacity by various sultans were initiated. The first real precursor to the current incarnation of Turkish intelligence came with the establishment of the Yıldız (Star) Organization (1880-1908) under Sultan Abdulhamid II.3 As the empire engaged in World War I, the Teşkilât-ı Mahsûsa (Special Organization, c1913-1920), led by Enver Paşa, played a crucial role in intelligence and special operations, navigating through the complexities of a global conflict and a crumbling empire.4 Intelligence activities during the period from the end of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the republic, between 1918 and 1923, quite rightly refocused the operational mission as various intelligence incarnations became focused primarily on internal consolidation and responding to external security issues that threatened the nascent Republic of Turkey. This period became critical in shaping the Republic’s future, both in terms of internal stability and foreign policy direction.5 The transition to the Republic of Turkey naturally brought transition and reforms to the intelligence services, most importantly being the institutionalization of intelligence operations. The new republic established the Millî Emniyet Hizmeti Riyâseti (M.E.H./MAH) in 19266 under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who centralized security intelligence collection and operations but the focus clearly remained on domestic security issues.7 As the republic found its footing from 1923 to 1947, the intelligence apparatus began to take a more defined shape. This era was marked by efforts to strengthen the newly founded state and navigate the complexities of an evolving international scene, particularly multiple efforts to draw the nation into World War II.8 The Cold War years saw a significant expansion and adaptation of Turkey’s intelligence capabilities to meet these strategic needs. The era presented new challenges and necessitated a strategic shift in intelligence activities. Turkey, straddling the Western bloc and the Soviet Union, needed to manage its foreign policy while keeping a keen eye on both internal and external threats. However, NATO accession provided access to new training, resources, and cooperation, in particular with the United States and the Central Intelligence Agency.9 This culminated in 1965, when the MAH underwent a significant transformation, evolving into the current National Intelligence Organization (MİT).10 The changes represented a strategic refinement of intelligence priorities to meet the republic’s expanding domestic security needs and foreign policy objectives. The newly formed MİT11 became responsible for collecting and analyzing both domestic and foreign intelligence, domestic security intelligence, and military co-ordination. The latter having major and lasting influence on the organization until the twenty-first century as leadership of the MİT was dominated by military officers.12 Clandestine operations are not new to Turkish foreign and security policy. An early example of Turkish intelligence’s clandestine operations can be seen in military intelligence and MAH activities against Bulgaria that provided support to NATO collection priorities.13 However, Turkey also targeted Greece during the Cyprus conflict from 1953 to 1970. This period marked a strategic use of clandestine activities by Turkish intelligence within the NATO alliance and against an erstwhile ally. The MİT operations were multifaceted, including: support for resistance movements, providing operational assistance, and evaluating military capabilities and readiness. As Sabri Yirmobeşoğlu, an ex general of the Turkish Armed Forces and ex secretary general of Turkey’s National Security Council (MGK) confided in an interview a few years ago, the MIT was responsible for the arming of Turkish Cypriot paramilitaries and the bombing of Turkish Cypriot targets,14 some to good effect in stoking unrest and building the basis for potential intervention. The bombing of the Bayraktar and Omeriye Mosques in Nikosia on March 25, 1962, was blamed squarely on the EOKA, the Greek Cypriot resistance organization, in order to sow the seeds of division among the island’s communities. A few years earlier, the detonation of a bomb in 1958 outside the Turkish consulate in Nikosia had sparked violent clashes between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. These clandestine operations solidified the rift between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots before the events in 1963 and 1974.15 The case highlights the developing role of clandestine intelligence operations in its immediate geography, in what the Turks considered a near domestic issue, and underscores the early use of clandestine action in contemporary Turkish foreign policy.16 By the end of the Cold War, the global geopolitical landscape underwent a dramatic transformation, and so did Turkey’s intelligence focus. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of new international dynamics required a re-evaluation and transition in intelligence operations. Turkish foreign policy during this period adapted to these new challenges and opportunities, reflecting the changing geopolitical environment. Even before the events of September 11, 2001, Turkey had been dealing with an active PKK terror campaign. The Turkish intelligence community focus on domestic threats, however, did not preclude out of area operations. This was most demonstrably expressed in the 1999 rendition of PKK leader Abdulla Ocalan from Nairobi.17 Like other NATO members, Turkey faced a significant shift in its security landscape with the 9/11 attacks on the United States and the first use of NATO Article 5. Although having a vast amount of experience in counter-terrorism, 2001-2020 saw a particular rise of expanded terrorist and asymmetric threats. This necessitated an evolution in Turkey’s intelligence community, significantly influencing its foreign policy to align more closely with global counter-terrorism initiatives and regional dynamics. Integral institutions, such as the MİT, as well as other security and intelligence agencies such as the chief of general staff, the ministry of interior, the ministry of foreign affairs, and the undersecretariat of public order and Security (KDGM) have been pivotal in this transformation. Their adaptive roles and contributions mirror the changing domestic and international challenges faced by Turkish security. It is in this historical context that sets the stage for understanding the subsequent developments in Turkish intelligence and its broader implications. Transition and Reformation: The Hakan Fidan Era The appointment of Hakan Fidan, a known Erdogan loyalist, did not initially appear to indicate a major change. Strictly speaking, MİT was not within the ministry of defense. However, historically, almost all senior leadership had come from the military branches. However, Fidan had been preparing for the position and change in Turkish intelligence structure and focus. Indeed, his 1999 master’s thesis compared the Turkish intelligence community to that of the United States and the United Kingdom.18 Fidan began restructuring the MİT along the lines of his 1999 plan by and pushing MİT into the forefront of Turkish foreign policy, resulting in the 2012 establishment of a foreign operations department and absorbing the signals intelligence (SIGINT) role of the military. By 2014, this was further entrenched legally when the Turkish parliament passed a law granting greater autonomy to the MİT and reorganizing its reporting structure. It aimed to address concerns about military dominance and allegations of human rights abuses during previous military leadership. This change has had three major effects on the MİT: Refocus of intelligence priorities. Traditionally the MİT had worked foreign intelligence because there was no other applicable agency. Now it officially included a broader foreign collection mandate. Measures for transparency and accountability to prevent power abuse and ensure operation within legal boundaries. A notable measure was establishing an independent inspector general position within the MİT, allowing internal investigations and monitoring of the agency’s activities for legal and ethical compliance. This oversight also included the establishment of parliamentary committees tasked with monitoring the MİT’s activities. This was the first time elected civilian committees would play a role in intelligence oversight by reviewing and evaluating the MİT’s performance, scrutinizing its budget, and providing a forum for public debate on intelligence matters. MİT Under Hakan Fidan Fidan was assigned 'special tasks' by Erdogan that even ministers within the cabinet were not aware of. That explains why Erdogan called him once as 'my secret-keeper … the state’s secret-keeper'.19 These missions included, for a start, the secret negotiations with the outlawed PKK in Oslo and Imrali20 between 2006 and 2011. Despite the ups and downs, these negotiations eventually resulted in the historic message by Ocalan in March 2013 and the start of the 'solution process' (Çözüm Süreci).21 This was by far the most comprehensive―and ambitious―effort by Turkey to resolve the decades-old Kurdish question through a negotiation and not an armed struggle. But Fidan was not engaged only in peace talks. In 2011, the Syrian Civil War erupted and very quickly metamorphosed, in the words of the ex-director of the CIA, into 'a Geopolitical Chernobyl' with various state and non-state actors locked in a deadly struggle.22 After Erdogan’s public appeal to Assad for reforms and reconciliation ended in a deadlock, Ankara decided to secretly support the rebels within the Free Syrian Army to overthrow the Assad regime. Despite the US open reservations, Turkey delivered weapons and money―and even training to certain militant groups that were not vetted by the CIA such as Ahrar al Sham or Sultan Murad Brigade. There was one critical problem with this approach, however: these rebels, though much more deadly on the battlefield than the de-centralized FSA, mainly consisted of hardliners who sometimes cooperated with Al Qaeda in Syria.23 This support for the rebels was done away from the public spotlight by the only agency that Erdogan could rely on for secrecy and efficacy: the MİT. Despite their best efforts, these clandestine ops were eventually documented and publicized by journalists who were later arrested.24 These leaks to the press did not manifest out of the blue; they were linked to the struggle in the shadows between Erdogan and his erstwhile ally against the Kemalists―Gulen. These power struggles would indeed express themselves over the Gezi Park Protests in 2013 and the Corruption Scandals in 2014.25 The Post-Coup MİT However, these contests would reach a head in July 2016 when a cabal of pro-Gulen military officers allegedly launched an (ultimately unsuccessful) coup d’état against Erdogan. The role of Fidan in these events is still shrouded in mystery; though the country’s spymaster, he failed to detect any signs of the impending coup and, thus, prevent its occurrence.26 Whatever the case, the MİT headquarters was viewed as a nerve center by coup plotters and was targeted by their helicopters. Despite their efforts, the putschists did not seize Fidan―though they did capture Hulusi Akar, chief of the general staff.27 These attacks against the MİT Headquarters promoted an overhaul of the intelligence agency. First of all, a sweeping purge of suspected and real sympathizers of the putschists was unleashed within MİT with thousands of agents ending in prison.28 Secondly, a new MİT headquarters, nicknamed the 'Kale' or 'Fortress', was built outside of Ankara on 5000 acres of land with three-meter high walls and other extensive security.29 Third, the MİT was expanded to include a clandestine paramilitary capability. From then onwards, the MİT would not only be an intelligence agency that collected and analyzed intelligence or co-operated with other services for clandestine operations. It would develop a paramilitary branch with its own direct action capability that would allow the MIT to operate independently in military theaters.30 This has enabled MİT to operate independently of the Turkish military and turn into a more versatile 'third-option'31 of Turkish foreign policy similar to the CIA. The aftershock of the new militarized MİT was nowhere felt as deeply as in Syria. The MİT already engaged in clandestine operations within Syria against the Assad regime. Erdogan imposed an absolute control over the army from 2011, and no one opposed his own plans for a buffer zone in Northern Syria. Only one month after the putsch, Turkey initiated Operation 'Euphrates Shield' in an effort to eject ISIS from Jarablus; in reality, however, Turkey intended to cut off the Kurds of Afrin from those in Manbij.32 Fidan was on the same page as Erdogan: as early as March 2014, he had suggested a false flag op in order to justify an armed incursion into Northern Syria.33 During the same period that Operation 'Euphrates Shield' unfolded, Fidan went to great lengths to foster a revolt within the Kurdish-controlled territory of Northern Syria; these pro-Turkey Arab and Kurdish militant groups (e.g. the Ahfad Salah al-Din Brigade) failed, however, and thus, vanished from the scene.34 In mid-2015, changing dynamics in Idlib Province had implications for regional stability.35 Besides, these hardliners were considered by Turkey a far lesser evil to the YPG, the Syrian offshoot of the PKK, despite the open objections of the USA.36 MIT was instrumental in the establishment of the Syrian National Army in December 2017―this umbrella organization for the anti-ISIS and anti-YPG militant groups (e.g. Hamza Division and al-Mu‘tasim Division).37 MIT reserved a preferential treatment for the Turkmens of Syria within the newly-formed SNA.38 In time, these Turkmen-heavy militant groups comprised the nucleus of the mercenaries that MIT employed in war theaters outside Syria itself.39 After Operation 'Euphrates Shield' (2016–2017), Turkey intervened again in Northern Syria thrice: twice against the Kurds (2018 and 2019), and once against the Assad regime (2020) to solidify its buffer zone along its southern border. Turkey utilized these rebels as auxiliaries or proxies for its own wars against the YPG and Assad; and MIT ensured that the rebel commanders toed the line; those who did not comply, were simply replaced by compliant ones.40 Challenges and Issues for MİT These secret networks in Idlib and Northern Syria would serve Turkey well in its interventions in other war theaters. The MIT recruited and transported thousands of rebels from Syria to Western Libya in late 2019 as mercenaries in order to lift the Siege of Tripoli by Haftar.41 Actually, the only casualties ever reported by Turkey in Operation 'Peace Storm' in Libya included an agent of and translator for MIT.42 The same story repeated itself in the 2ndKarabakh War: the MIT arranged for the recruitment and transport of these rebels from Syria (or Libya) to the mountains of Azerbaijan where they were utilized in human waves to overrun Armenian military outposts.43 In other words, the MIT acted as the tip of the spear in the policy doctrine that Erdogan implemented from Operation 'Olive Branch' in 2018 onwards: that of 'surrogate warfare'.44 In this version a la Turca, rebels or mercenaries from Syria acted as the human surrogates with the drones (especially the by now world famous Bayraktar TB2)45 as the technological ones. The MIT was an integral element in both versions of these surrogates: it recruited the rebels as proxies, on the one hand, and it provided the drones with the necessary critical intel for the targeted killings, on the other hand. However, three challenges emerged from the continued use of clandestine operations: The primary concern revolved around the political authorization of the National Intelligence Organization’s (MİT) clandestine activities, directed by the presidency. These operations sparked intense debates within the Turkish Parliament regarding appropriate oversight for the intelligence service.46 Secondly, the proxies frequently faced accusations of committing severe human rights violations against civilians in Northern Syria, particularly in Afrin. The inability or reluctance of MİT to control these undisciplined militias has marred the organization’s reputation.47 Finally, Turkey’s engagements with hardline militias in Northern Syria have caused concerns in both Washington and Moscow.48 In addition to these, the MİT organized a witch-hunt against supporters of the self-exiled imam, Fetullah Gulen, all over the world in the aftermath of the failed coup d’état. This witch-hunt resulted in renditions without due process from several countries (e.g. Kazakhstan, Moldova) and, according to the victims’ own testimonies, in torture and solitary confinement in 'black sites'.49 These clandestine programs, operated exclusively by the MİT strained Turkey’s relationship with the West.50 These renditions were not the sole instances where MİT’s actions strained its traditional relationships with Western and Western-aligned states. Such activities underscored the growing significance of clandestine intelligence operations’ role in shaping Turkish foreign policy. This change underscores a pivotal shift towards a more assertive and independent stance in Turkey’s international strategy. Turkish clandestine operations in Northern Syria serve as another example. Throughout 2023, MİT targeted both the military and civil leadership of the Kurds with its own agents and drones. In April 2023, a strike by an MİT-operated drone almost neutralized Mazlum Kobane–the commander-in-chief of the Kurdish YPG/SDF in Northern Syria. The attempted murder of a well-known US ally was not the only affront to the USA: at the time, Kobane was stationed in a US military base in Northern Syria and, thus, the safety of the US Marines was jeopardized.51 This attack prompted a complaint by the USA―both in public and in private―toward Turkey. But it did little to deter the MİT. Indeed, agents of the MİT continue to stir up the rebellious Arab tribes in Deir-ez-Zor against the Kurds to the extent than an armed uprising―eventually unsuccessful―flared up between August and September 2023.52 The Future of Turkish Intelligence Erdogan won the presidential election in May 2023 despite the alliance of the six opposition parties. He appointed his trusted 'keeper of secrets', Fidan, to the post of foreign minister. Ibrahim Kalin, the national security advisor, took over as head of MIT. These changes signaled that hawks would reign on issues of intelligence and diplomacy. Indeed, this was evident in the ongoing operations in Northern Iraq and Syria. In 2023, the MİT neutralized 201 fighters of the PKK and YPG in total in 181 clandestine ops that involved the use of UCAVs and destroyed 45 targets of critical infrastructure (e.g. oil wells in Northern Syria).53 These operations occurred despite the protests of Washington that resulted in a 'blue on blue' incident in October 2023 when the United States downed a Turkish UCAV to protect is soldiers in Northern Syria.54 This incident, however, did little to deter the MİT, which continued its campaign of targeted killings. Implications for Turkish Foreign Policy The appointment of İbrahim Kalın as the new head of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization marks another significant transition in the landscape of Turkish intelligence and foreign policy since 2010. Kalin brings a distinct background to his new role as the intelligence chief, having previously served as the chief presidential advisor and spokesperson. Kalin’s elevation to the head of the MİT could signal a nuanced shift in the strategic direction of Turkish intelligence. Given his previous role, Kalin is expected to maintain a close alignment with Erdoğan’s foreign policy objectives. This alignment might lead to a more synchronized and coherent strategy between the presidential office and intelligence operations, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of Turkish foreign policy, particularly with Fidan now heading the foreign ministry. Kalin’s deep involvement in diplomatic and advisory roles suggests a possible emphasis on integrating intelligence findings more directly into foreign policy decision-making. This could result in a more proactive and strategic use of intelligence in shaping Turkey’s international relations, especially in its dealings with neighboring regions and global powers. It should be noted that both Fidan and Kalin share the same vision with Erdogan about Turkey’s place in this ever-changing international environment: namely, that Turkey should not stick to its old orientation to the West but side with the rising Euro-Asian powers such as Russia and China which, just like Erdogan, challenge the current status quo. The Future of MİT Clandestine Operations Under Kalin’s leadership, the MİT is likely to continue its active role in clandestine operations, which have been a significant aspect of Turkey’s assertive foreign policy under Erdoğan. These operations, particularly those aimed at countering terrorism and protecting national interests, are expected to remain a priority. However, Kalin’s approach to such operations might differ from his predecessor’s, potentially focusing more on strategic intelligence gathering and less on high-profile operations, depending on the evolving geopolitical landscape. Kalin’s tenure could also see a continued emphasis on technological advancements in intelligence, particularly in cyber intelligence and surveillance capabilities. This would align with the global trend of increasing reliance on technological means for intelligence gathering and analysis. Conclusion One of the primary challenges Kalin will face is navigating the complex regional dynamics, particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean. How he manages relationships with key players in these regions, while advancing Turkey’s interests, will be a critical aspect of his tenure. Additionally, Kalin will need to address the evolving nature of security threats, including cyber threats and the shifting landscape of terrorism and extremism. Balancing traditional intelligence methods with innovative approaches will be key to effectively countering these challenges. The appointment of Kalin as the new head of the MİT represents a pivotal moment for Turkish intelligence. His background and close ties to the presidency suggest a potential shift in the operational and strategic focus of the organization. As Kalin takes on this role, his decisions and strategies will not only shape the future trajectory of the MİT but also play a significant role in Turkish foreign policy and its clandestine operations. His leadership will be instrumental in determining how Turkey navigates its complex regional and international environment in the coming years.55 About the authors: Dr. John Hatzadony is Program Chair at Rabdan Academy.

Demilitarizing Environmental Protection Will Benefit Colombia’s B...	By Dr Caroline Delgado and Tatjana Edle von Peter The peace process in Colombia has transformed the country’s security landscape. With the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC), once the largest guerrilla force in the Western hemisphere, laying down its arms, environmental degradation has become a major national security concern, fuelled by illegal logging, deforestation, wildlife trafficking, mining, and the cultivation and processing of coca and other drug crops. The rise in environmental crime not only endangers Colombia’s rich biodiversity but also risks destabilizing the fragile peace. Successive Colombian governments have pursued an increasingly militarized approach to environmental protectionsince 2010. This has exacerbated the suffering of marginalized ethnic communities and subsistence farmers—who are vital to environmental stewardship and conservation and have already endured some of the harshestimpactsof over 50 years of armed conflict. The militarized approach perpetuates cycles of violence and neglect, reinforcing the historical power imbalances that have driven Colombia’s past conflicts and could well drive new ones, while the scale of environmental degradation has grown. By undermining and even criminalizing those who have sustainably managed the land for generations, the militarized approach not only deepens their marginalization but also threatens the ecosystems that sustain them and the well-being of future generations. This blog explores why this is happening and what needs to be done. The peace process and the rise of environmental crime A 2016 peace agreement formally ended over 50 years of armed conflict between FARC and the Colombian government. FARC had already declared a unilateral indefinite ceasefire inDecember 2014, which—although it was occasionally breached—significantly de-escalated the conflict, particularly in the rural areas where the conflict had been most intense. These areas were predominantly inhabited by marginalized small-scale subsistence farmers (campesinos) and ethnic communities, including Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities. The agreement explicitly recognized these communities as some of the main victims of the armed conflict, due to both direct violence and state neglect. Social inclusion and the integration of Colombia’s peripheral and conflict-affected regions are at the heart of the agreement’s ‘territorial-based approach’; a chapter on comprehensive rural reform seeks to close the gap between marginalized rural areas and prosperous urban centres. By mid 2017, FARC had ceased to exist and by 2020, more than 13000 former FARC combatants had demobilized. However, around800former FARC members rejected the peace agreement andthousandswho initially demobilized havetaken up armsagain, joining either FARC dissident groups—whose members are believed to total more than5200—or other non-state armed groups. Before the peace process, FARC’s control over certain regions of Colombia—many of them environmentally sensitive—unintentionally acted as a safeguard for biodiversity bylimiting deforestation. FARC forces used theforest canopyto provide cover and in some cases protected the environment for local farmers, penalizing excessive logging and hunting. Their presence alsoblockedinfrastructure development, industrial agriculture, and resource extraction by national or foreign companies. FARC’s demobilization, however, created a security vacuum that criminal organizations, including FARC dissident groups, were quick to exploit for unsustainable resource extraction. FARC’s departure also provided smallholders, large landowners and international companies with opportunities to expand into remote forest areas that had previously been toodangerous. Post-conflict investment and economic expectations led to land grabbing, speculation and conversion. Amid these changes environmental crime surged. Between 2015 and 2017, deforestation—driven mainly by cattle ranching, illegal mining and drug trafficking—increased by 77 per cent and only in2022did rates come back down to the 2015 level. From2016to2020, areas impacted by alluvial gold mining rose by 20 per cent, withtwo thirdsof the mining being illegal. Despite a slight decline in the total area used for mining in 2022, the share of mining that was illegal grew to73 per centbetween 2021 and 2022.Nearly halfof all alluvial gold mining sites overlap with coca cultivation areas, which themselves expanded by140 per centbetween 2015 and 2022. Deforestation is also tied to illegal land grabbing, where state-owned land, forest reserves and Indigenous territories are cleared and occupied. By converting forested land into, for example, cattle pasture, land grabbers gain short-term profits and lay the groundwork for future legalownership. Militarized environmental protection In response to these developments, as well as mounting international pressure on the Colombian government to protect the Amazon as a crucial carbon sink, Colombia’s armed forces have become deeply involved in environmental protection and the fight against environmental crime. In 2018 the government created the Comprehensive Environmental Protection Force (Fuerza Integral de Protección Ambiental). This body, involving the Ministry of National Defence along with environmental authorities and the Attorney General’s Office,was tasked with safeguarding ecosystems, biodiversity and natural resources. A year later, a military operation, Operación Artemisa, was launched to combat deforestation, illegal mining and wildlife trafficking, deploying23000 membersof Colombia’s police and armed forces during its first year. Although the operation recovered 21480 hectares of forest, it faced strong opposition and criticism for targeting smallholder farmers and violating their human rights while failing to stop the larger financiers ofdeforestation. Thedefence and security policyadopted under the presidency of Iván Duque Márquez (2018–22) emphasized the protection of water, biodiversity and natural resources as a strategic priority. It created specialized military units focused on environmental protection. TheZonas Futuro strategy, launched in 2019 as part of the peace process implementation, further intensified militarization by integratingarmy, navy and police effortsto bolster security presence and intelligence in violence-prone areas. Despite criticism of militarized approaches to environmental protection, the government formed in 2022 has maintained environmental security as a central element of itssecurity and defence strategy. Mixed results and unintended consequences Data suggests that, aside from the recent decline in deforestation, the militarized approach has largely failed not only to curb environmental crime but also to protect its victims. Since the peace agreement was signed, more than1200human rights defenders andlíderes sociales(social leaders) have been killed, and in 2023 alone,79environmental human rights defenders were killed, most of them members of ethnic communities andcampesinosfighting to defend their land. The main perpetrators of the violence are non-state armed groups that drive and profit from environmental crime and the shadow economy it supports. They also commit kidnappings, child recruitment, coercive displacement or confinement, and other abuses. However, the armed forces have also been accused of victimizing marginalized ethnic groups and subsistence farming communities, employingexcessive force,sexual violence,unlawful killings,arbitrary arrests, and the destruction of homes andlivelihoods. Much of this has been officially justified as part of combating environmental crime, but many claim that it has been used as a means torepress, silence and stigmatizethose exercising their rights. While somecampesinosand members of ethnic communities do engage in illegal activities such as land clearing, coca cultivation and informal mining, this has often been a survival strategy in response to long-standing state neglect in rural areas. Despite this, and the fact that they play only aminor rolein large-scale environmental destruction and are oftencoercedby armed groups, the militarized response has disproportionately targeted small-scale farmers at the lowest echelons of criminal enterprises or who are simply farming in protected areas. Ways forward Since the new government took office in 2022, there has been growing recognition of the challenges marginalized communities face in relation to environmental crime and official responses to it. The latest national developmentplanandsecurity policyemphasize a people-centred, community-based approach focused on addressing the root causes of conflict and crime. This hopefully heralds a shift from prosecuting small-scale farmers to targeting the criminal organizations behind illegal economies, including those funding deforestation. While this is a welcome development, it is essential that the role of the armed forces in environmental protection is reduced to a minimum. Striking a balance between enforcing environmental laws and safeguarding human rights is crucial. Although the military may be necessary to confront non-state armed groups contributing to violence and fuelling environmental crime, the marginalized populations who feel the most negative effects from these activities should instead be supported by strong, democratic institutions that prioritize equity as well assecurity. At the heart of this issue lies the need toprotectbiodiversity and the people safeguarding these areas. Colombia’s struggles against deforestation and environmental crime stem from a complex interplay of legal and illegal activities, sociopolitical dynamics, and economic incentives. These challenges are deeply rooted in more than half a century of armed conflict, including the profound disconnect between the socio-economic models shaped by the state and elites—often enforced through violence by the illegal armed groups, in particularparamilitaries—and the survival strategies of marginalized local communities. Ethnic groups, particularly Indigenous peoples, andcampesinosare among the most committed defenders of biodiversity. Their ancestral practices and traditional knowledge could be crucial to preserving ecosystems. Although Indigenous knowledge systems are diverse, many share a common understanding of ecological degradation: it stems from the denial of the interdependence betweenhumans and nature. Indigenous worldviews emphasize this interconnectedness and the responsibilities that flow from it. In Colombia’s struggle to address its environmental challenges, these communities, alongside other ethnic minorities andcampesinos, should be treated as partners in conservation efforts, not penalized by a militarized response.

Sudan Chaos Could Create Terrorism Haven – Analysis	The chaos that has engulfed Sudan since war broke out in April 2023 could make the country a nexus for terrorism that connects violent extremists in the Sahel with terror groups in Somalia and even Yemen, observers say. 'I really feel quite frightened about this,' Abdalla Hamdok, Sudan’s former prime minister, told the Financial Times. 'With Sudan bordering seven countries, it will become fertile ground for terrorism in a region that is very fragile.' Hamdok said a return to civilian rule is the best way to prevent terrorism from taking root in Sudan. After he took the reins of a short-lived civilian government in 2020, the international community eased decades-old terrorism-related restrictions on Sudan. Sudan’s military leaders deposed Hamdok in 2021 as civilians were about to take control of the government as part of the transition from 30 years of rule by dictator Omar al-Bashir. Less than two years later, those military leaders — Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) leader Gen. Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemedti' Dagalo — turned on each other. Since then, 150,000 people have been killed, more than 10 million have fled their homes and half of the country’s 49 million residents face famine. Sudan under al-Bashir was an extremist haven. The country hosted al-Qaida and its founder, Osama bin Laden, for many years in the 1990s before bin Laden moved to Afghanistan. 'The political conditions in Sudan in the 1990s were similar in some respects to the situation today: Sudan was riven by civil war and ruled by a military dictatorship that had only recently come to power,' analyst Suliman Baldo wrote in the Sudan War Monitor. Sudan’s civil war has drawn the attention of extremist groups, particularly social media channels aligned with the Islamic State group (IS). 'These outlets see the violent clashes between the SAF and RSF as an opportunity to exploit the chaos and discredit its rivals, from local governments to other jihadist groups, like the Afghan Taliban,' analyst Herbert Maack wrote recently for the Jamestown Foundation. IS encourages supporters to take weapons from the SAF and RSF and to fight to impose Shariah in Sudan, according to Maack. After it emerged in Iraq and Syria a decade ago, IS drew hundreds of radicalized Sudanese citizens to its cause. Sudanese extremists also have joined Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region and terrorist groups in Libya. Sudanese native Bilal al-Sudani rose to a leadership position in IS’s Somali branch before he was killed in a counterterrorism action in 2023. Sudan’s location between the Sahel and the Red Sea already has made it a logistical hub for terrorists across the region. According to the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, IS has financial operations in Sudan and up to 200 veteran fighters on the ground who coordinate logistics, including moving other extremists into southern Libya, Mali and beyond. Sudan’s IS operatives recently announced on Telegram that they pledged allegiance to the organization’s new caliph, Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The presence of IS-aligned fighters in Sudan creates the potential that Sudanese fighters outside the country could return and boost the existing groups, expanding Sudan’s role as a bridge between terrorists in the Sahel, Somalia and even Yemen, according to Maack. 'This increases the risk of Sudan’s re-emergence as an African hub for jihadist terrorism,' Maack wrote.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9Nm0w25waxoWd	2024-10-23T17:00:41-07:00	
Chinese Drills Raise Tensions In The Taiwan Straits – Analysis	By Kalpit A Mankikar Tensions in the Taiwan Straits are again running high following Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s National Day speech. In his address, Lai stated that the nation’s sovereignty could not be infringed upon and that China had no right to represent Taiwan. Beijing has responded with the ‘Joint Sword 2024B’ drills, which the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) says centres on joint maritime and aerial combat readiness, blockade and control of important ports, strikes on sea and land targets, and regarding comprehensive control of the battlefield to test the real-combat capabilities of the forces. The mainland’s aircraft carrier ‘Liaoning’ also participated in the drills. Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense announced that125Chinese aircraft had been detected on 14 October, among which90entered Taiwan’s air defence identification zone—making it the largest aerial incursion on a single day. As many as17Chinese warships and an equal number of Coast Guard vessels had been sighted around the island during the drills. China assesses Lai’s first National Day address as steering towards independence, with an aim of cutting off the connections between the mainland and the island. A commentary published in the PLA Dailyaccuses Lai of pushing the 'two-state theory'. Another commentary in the PLA Daily justifies the military drills, stating that the outcome of working towards 'Taiwan independence' is a war, pitching for building military capabilities to defeat separatist activities. China has tried to deride Taiwanese military capabilities, likening it to ants trying to uproot a big tree. An article in the People’s Daily also calls into question Washington’s role in 'pushing Taipei towards independence'. It posits that describing Lai’s speech as 'restrained' and 'moderate' by United States (US) officials is a show of support for the separatist cause. It accuses the US of plotting to use the Taiwan card to control the mainland. China has also chosen to join the dots with another development in India. Taiwan recently opened another representative office in Mumbaideepening its engagement with India, which has led the Chinese foreign ministry to express concerns, warning against the establishments of any official contacts with Taipei. Taipei reframes the narrative against Beijing President Lai also referred to the rise of conflicts globally and framed Taiwan’s situation as resisting the expansion of authoritarianism. This framing of the 'Taiwan versus China' clash of democracy and authoritarianism has also been reinforced by his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. During her recent trip to Europe to attend the yearly Forum 2000 conference, she said that Taiwan was on the frontline of democracy, braving an onslaught from dictatorships. She also warned of the increasing use of information warfare and military coercion by dictatorships to export their prototype of a political system across the globe. The Forum 2000 conclaves, founded by former Czech President Vàclav Havel, are attended by people’s representatives and activists to deliberate on issues like human rights, civil liberties, and democracy. There is a great divergence in how both the mainland and Taiwan see the situation. A commentary in the Chinese state perceives the current tension as a conflict between unification and separation, not a contest of systems. In recent times, President Lai has made a case to trace its political lineage to the revolution on the mainland in the early 20th century that dethroned China’s Imperial Qing dynasty, contrasting Beijing marking its 75th National Day on 1 October as opposed to Taipei commemorating its 113th anniversary. Lai has also upped the ante, seemingly seeking to draw a wedge between Beijing and Moscow. Taiwan’s President has argued that if Beijing thought its claims on Taipei held water, then it should also try to recover territory lost by the Imperial Qing dynasty to the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Implications of military coercion This is the third time in the recent past that China has responded with military coercion with respect to Taiwan. The PLA had launched similar drills following then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island in 2022, and recently this year after President Lai’s inauguration. During his speech at the National Party Congress in 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping asserted that the option to unify Taiwan by force, if necessary, was on China’s agenda. He has also followed it up by telling his PLA commanders to train soldiers better and under battle conditions. Early this year, Xi also inspected the Army Medical University in Chongqing, pitching for better battlefield treatment techniques, medical universities and synchronised logistics support. This comes following reports that the PLA conducted drills to ascertain the efficacy of evacuation measures at islands off the Zhejiang province’s coastline. This has fuelled speculation if the military exercises were intended to assess PLA battle readiness in the event of a possible move to annex Taiwan. First, as a consequence of the repeated blockade exercises, the PLA is improving its ability to operate in the waters around Taiwan to combat American intervention. Second, China recently authorised its Coast Guard to use weapons if its national sovereignty is threatened. Furthermore, China’s Coast Guard is permitted to demarcate 'exclusion zones' in which vessels of other nations will not be allowed to enter. Consequently, their increasing participation in such military exercises around the Taiwan Straits increases the risks of escalation in the event of an accident. Lastly, the normalisation of such repeated military coercion and the muted response by other nations may in future embolden China to first mobilise PLA for drills, and then swiftly convert it into an invasion. Beijing’s grey-zone warfare thus needs closer scrutiny.

Claudia Sheinbaum As First Woman President Of Mexico: Promises An...	By Saurabh Mishra Claudia Sheinbaum was sworn in as the first woman President of Mexico on 1 October 2024. Sheinbaum was the Mayor of Mexico City prior to her election as president. She succeeds Andrés Manuel López Obrador, popularly known as AMLO, whose approval ratings has never been less than 60 per cent.1 Both Obrador and Sheinbaum belong to the democratic left-wing Morena Party that was founded and nurtured by AMLO. Obrador had to demit office due to Mexico’s constitutional limit on presidential terms. Sheinbaum campaigned as a candidate for ‘continuity with change’,2 and secured 60.7 per cent of the vote share in a landslide victory.3 She improved the Morena party tally both in terms of vote percentage and the number of seats acquired in the two houses of the Mexican Parliament. Obrador had secured about 53 per cent of the popular votes in 2018.4 Sheinbaum also achieved a supermajority in the Lower House (Chamber of Deputies) of the Parliament, falling just three seats short in the Upper House (Senate). Given that two opposition senators flipped to her side recently, she needs to convince only one more member to make any constitutional changes.5 For a party (Morena) which began as a social movement in 2011 and formally registered with the National Electoral Institute (INE) only in 2014, the two consecutive presidential victories successively improving parliamentary seat tallies are nothing short of a historic and meteoric rise. The stage for Mexico to get its first woman president was almost set when another woman Xóchitl Gálvez became the presidential candidate of the main opposition, a coalition of the traditional old parties—National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). President Sheinbaum in the past had worked as a climate scientist representing Mexico in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). She was a member of the panel when it received the Nobel Prize in 2007. Given her administrative and technocratic experiences, there are expectations that there could be improvements on policies related to the economy, war against narcotics, militarisation and climate change. She portrayed herself as a candidate who will continue AMLO’s legacy with changes, promising Mexicans a non-discriminatory and investor-friendly government. Economic Policies Sheinbaum inherits successes of AMLO’s economic interventions that has brought poverty to a historic low (36.3 per cent in 2022) bringing millions out of poverty.6 The average income of the people has increased while the minimum wage has doubled.7 However, the number of people in extreme poverty and inadequate access to health have also increased.8 The public expenditure in the country is at an all-time high and fiscal deficit is at its highest (5.9 per cent) in the last four decades.9 Sheinbaum has promised not only to continue AMLO’s direct cash schemes to the poor Mexicans but also to expand the net and bring in those who are still outside. Sheinbaum seems determined to adhere to fiscal discipline which was not under control in the later part of the AMLO administration.10 Given the expectations of the people with rising government expenditure, it may be challenging for her to balance the promise of bringing the fiscal deficit down to 3.5 per cent and make Mexico attractive for further investments.11 The Mexican Peso saw further decline with President Sheinbaum reaffirming continuation of the economic policies of her predecessor.12 Her economic and political astuteness is to be tested as the US, Spain and Canada and several other countries are wary of the policies of the Morena party. Constitutional Amendments AMLO had pushed for 18 constitutional changes which he could not implement in the absence of the required two-thirds majority in both the houses. Electing the judiciary, integrating National Guard with the defence ministry, eliminating proportional representation in parliament, ending autonomy of several constitutional agencies were the most controversial proposals among them.13 But the elections in June 2024 provided him the opportunity to carry out these changes with the support of President elect Sheinbaum. He enacted the judicial as well National Guard reforms through constitutional amendments in the last month of his tenure before handing over the reins of government to his protégé. The changes in judiciary recruitment have been intensely criticised by both professionals as well as members of the civil society. They do not expect any immediate change on the issue as Sheinbaum has initiated for secondary legislations to implement the reforms. She wants the electoral laws to be amended in line with the constitution so that the people could henceforth elect their judges from bottom to the top level of the judiciary.14 The reforms have been highly divisive with concerns that the judiciary could be influenced by criminal groups, money power and electoral politics. Although the Supreme Court has accepted to consider a constitutional challenge to the enacted judicial reforms,15 Sheinbaum's role and the outcome of the whole reform process will be keenly watched. The agenda for constitutional amendments is long and provocative, ranging from constitutionalising health, rights of indigenous people, new electoral powers, to expanding scope of preventive custody, etc. The bottom-line of these amendments is generally read as centralising of powers and more fiscal burden for the state. War against Narcotic Drugs and Militarisation Mexico is experiencing a political and economic paradigm shift with the popularity of Morena party, and the momentum continues with President Sheinbaum. However, party policies on the issues of security and law and order have not received the expected applause even from quarters that are appreciative of the developmental successes of the Morena party. The party has been accused of continuing militarisation of the state, contrary to the promise made by AMLO when he was campaigning for his election.16 The presence of the military in the civilian domain has only increased. The military has been handed over many civilian functions to keep the state machinery efficient. The number of homicides in Mexico has been higher than the years before AMLO, while violence by drug cartels continues unabashedly.17 The recent elections also saw killings of many candidates by criminal gangs to influence the outcomes of the electoral process. Drug cartels and disappearances of many citizens and migrants is a pandemic in Mexico. AMLO had promised to address the problem and put the military off the streets. People in Mexico believe that elements of military and police are complicit with the drug and criminal cartels responsible for these disappearances,18 while AMLO is strengthening them. Civil society and social groupings in Mexico, especially the feminist groups, are unhappy with the government policy of militarisation to deal with the problem. To them, the cause cannot be the remedy, and they expect Sheinbaum to prioritise the issue of disappearances, putting the military and police under question for their complicity or failure. Bringing violence and disappearances down, especially against the women, is another daunting task before the new president. Feminist and Environmental Policies Mexico takes pride in its identity of a country with a feminist foreign policy, which is now under a woman for the first time.19 Sheinbaum, in her campaign as well as the inaugural speech, has put extra emphasis on her being a woman president. Ironically, violence against women in Mexico is rampant despite women being active, visible and functional at all the levels of society. AMLO had publicly fallen out with the feminist groups of the country on the issue of violence and disappearances. It is to be seen how President Sheinbaum responds to these criticisms and translates her promises into action. Sheinbaum’s policies relating to the environment will be keenly watched. She is known for aligning with President Obrador’s hydrocarbon policies. However, in her first public speech on Zocalo square after being sworn in as President, she assured a return to energy transition policies discontinued by her predecessor. She promised a 45 per cent share of renewable sources in electricity production by 2030.20 Conclusion The euphoria following Sheinbaum’s swearing in as the first woman president of Mexico is reflective of the people’s expectations from her. She faces many challenges, though. On the economic front, these include the welfarist benchmarks left by AMLO. As the first female president who was also an environment scientist, her policies relating to energy transition and countering violence against women will be keenly watched. Sheinbaum has a difficult task of bridging the euphoria and reality, as Obrador has left office with historic popularity but at the cost of fiscal balance and civilian control. She has not come up with a clear policy against militarisation of the Mexican society, and it seems it will be difficult for her to shake off the tag of continuity, except on the issue of energy transition.

UK Court Accepts Case About Saudi Spyware Use: HRW	The United Kingdom High Court issued an order on October 11, 2024, granting permission to a Saudi human rights defender who lives in the UK to bring a case that accuses the government of Saudi Arabia of using spyware against him, Human Rights Watch said today. Yahya Assiri, a prominent Saudi human rights defender, says that Saudi authorities targeted him with spyware between 2018 and 2020. The High Court order allows Assiri to bring his legal challenge against Saudi Arabia through the UK’s diplomatic channels. Assiri filed a legal claim against Saudi Arabia on May 28 for targeting him with spyware, claiming that the Saudi government harassed him, misused his private information, and wrongfully interfered with his mobile phones. 'The Saudi government has been accused of using the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to monitor and silence Saudi human rights defenders for years with impunity,' said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'Assiri’s case before the British courts is an important step toward holding the Saudi government to account after years of transnational repression and repeated rights violations.' Critics of the Saudi government and dissidents havepubliclyraisedconcernsabout Saudi authorities’useof commercially available surveillance technologies to hack into their devices and online accounts. In his claim, Assiri said that the Saudi government targeted his devices with spyware multiple times between 2018 and 2020. Assiri is a prominent Saudi human rights activist who founded the London-based Saudi human rights organization,ALQST, and was a founding member of the National Assembly Party, a Saudi opposition party. In 2013, he left Saudi Arabia for the UK out of fear for his safety due to his human rights work in the country and was granted asylum in the UK in 2017. The UK High Court’s action is an important step toward accountability for the Saudi government’s alleged attacks against Assiri, Human Rights Watch said. Governments should ban the sale, export, transfer, and use of surveillance technology until human rights safeguards are in place. In 2018, Citizen Lab, an academic research center based in Canada, found that suspicious messages received by Assiri appeared to representattemptsto infect him 'with the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.' Assiri and his lawyers say that the Saudi governmentinfectedanother one of Assiri’s mobile devices with spyware developed by QuaDream in 2018. They said that in July 2020, another of Assiri’s devices was hacked using Pegasus. Pegasus isdevelopedand sold by the Israel-based company NSO Group. NSO Groupsaysit only licenses Pegasus to governments. NSO Group’s clients surreptitiously deliver the Pegasus spyware onto the targeted person’s mobile phones. Once Pegasus is on the device, theclientis able to turn it into a powerful surveillance tool by gaining complete access to its camera, calls, media, microphone, email, text messages, and other functions, enabling surveillance of the person targeted and their contacts. 'Inside Saudi Arabia, the authorities silence people through arrest and prosecution, preventing them from speaking out against corruption and repression,' Assiri said in a statement about the case. 'Outside, they employ hacking and other forms of transnational repression. I want to use this legal action as a means to put pressure on the Saudi authorities.' Monika Sobiecki, partner at Bindmans LLP, the firm that filed the claim on behalf of Assiri, said in a statement that 'the abuse of my client’s privacy rights now formally calls for an explanation from the State.' Saudi authorities have repeatedly sought to identify anonymous dissidents and spy on Saudi citizens through their digital communications. In 2018, Citizen Labconcludedthat a Canada-based Saudi activist’s phone was infected with spyware, allowing full access to personal files, messages, contacts, microphone, and cameras. Another investigation published by Citizen Lab in January 2020 also revealed that two other exiled Saudi dissidents, a New York Times journalist, and an Amnesty International staff member had beentargeted. In July 2021, the Pegasus Projectrevealedthat the Saudi government was possibly one of NSO Group’s government clients for its Pegasus spyware. Pegasus spyware hascompromisedthe devices of human rights activists, including staff from Human Rights Watch, journalists, politicians, diplomats, and others in violation of their rights, underscoring the urgent need to regulate the global trade in surveillance technology, Human Rights Watch said. All governments should ban the sale, export, transfer, and use of all commercial spyware until human rights safeguards are in place. 'Saudi authorities have for years been using spyware against human rights defenders living in other countries who seek to document the worst of the government’s abuses,' Shea said. 'This case in an important step toward accountability and justice.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfVmspJtOIn09sYplBO5J-7	2024-10-22T16:23:41-07:00	
Yemen’s Government Cannot Ignore Looming Unrest – OpEd	By Fernando Carvajal Yemen remains on the margins for the international community even as millions suffer from a deepening economic crisis and lack of humanitarian aid. It has been ten years since theHouthis, an Iranian-sponsored terrorist group, gainedcontrolof Yemen’s capital Sana’a, and nearly a year since they began strikes within the Bab el-Mandeb Strait in the southern Red Sea. Despite the ongoing strife, world leaders at the 79th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 79) in September merely reiterated the same sentiments that they have been repeating over the past six months. They condemned Houthi terrorism, but they did not put forward a coherent strategy to halt the strikes and force the Sana’a rebels back to negotiations. Tensions grow amid broken promises The people of South Yemen, in particular, cannot wait another year for solutions. Conditions on the ground are ripe for instability. The areas under the internationally recognized Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), the Yemeni institution officially recognized by the international community, remain fragile across South Yemen. The PLC and its Saudi-led international allies cannot afford distractions from the fight against Houthis. Neither can the Southern Transitional Council (STC), the secessionist organization backed by the United Arab Emirates. While the PLC and the STC signed theRiyadh Agreementin April 2022, joining forces against the Houthis, the STC still advocates for the South’s secession. As discontent against both leaderships grows, leaders must advance the interests of the marginalized population to sustain momentum against the Houthis. The Riyadh Agreement not onlytransferred powerfrom former president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to the newly established PLC, but it also served to recognize the STC as the representative of the people of South Yemen. STC chief Aidarus al-Zubaidistatedthat the agreement would pave the way 'to develop a negotiating framework' wherein 'determining the future, the solution of the issue of the people of the South [should come] naturally.' However, more than two years since the STC joined with the PLC, South Yemenis remain marginalized. Initially, thePLCdidn’t aim to resolve the political conflict in the South, but rather to unite ranks with the STC against the Houthis. However, the PLC has not made much progress on this front. Lack of trust between the parties prevented military unity. While the lack of success undoubtedly affects the STC, the PLC became the main focus of criticism when it proved unable to counter Houthi strikes that halted all oil and gas production. The government has made no progress regarding the issue of southern independence. When al-Zubaidi joined the talks in 2022, heaimedto situate the southern issue front and center. However, a year later, PLC leader Rashad al-Alimiclaimedthat 'now is not the right time to discuss southern independence.' STC officials immediately shot back at al-Alimi, claiming he 'showed a lack of seriousness.' Alimi’s comments inflamed feelings across the South, not only among pro-STC elements but also among the tribes of eastern Yemen, an area that is formally under PLC control. The PLC hasfailedto meet basic demands for public services in areas like the eastern region of Hadhramaut. When al-Alimi visited Hadhramaut in July, he was met byprotests. Then, on October 14, thousands in Seiyun, Hadhramaut sent a clear message to al-Alimi. During a celebration commemorating the 61st anniversary of independence from Britain, citizens of Hadhramaut expressed their support for the STC. On October 19, another event in al-Ghaydah, al-Mahra promoted 'Southern Identity' as a symbol against PLC leadership. A deepening economic crisis stokes tensions in the South South Yemenis aredissatisfied. The PLC has failed to eliminate security threats, public services are diminishing, and an economic crisis is deepening. Over the last year, the Houthis have beenattackingcommercialvesselstransiting through the Red and Arabian Seas. Their tactics andweaponshave evolved with potency and efficiency. Al-Zubaidipoints outthat failures to deal with Houthis are 'no longer acceptable.' He maintains that 'it is in the interest of our people to end the conflict and find a permanent solution.' Not only have the Houthis interfered with international shipping lanes, they have alsodevastatedsouthern Yemeni ports. This dramatically increases the difficulty of getting imports into South Yemen, exacerbatinginflationand choking supplies of international food aid. According to the OCHA, food imports in the southern ports of Aden and Mukalla declined by 13%. The UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA) notes that shortages in incoming aid left 'around 3.6 million [Yemenis] with reducedrations.' More funding crises could affect a further 2.5 million. The Yemeni rial also slid 'to an all-time low of YER1,681/USD by the end of April 2024.' The failure to stop Houthi attacks has also prevented Yemen from exporting oil, a potential source of much-needed cash. In mid-2021, the Houthisattemptedto take over oil facilities across Shabwa. After they failed to do so, in October 2022 their strategy shifted to using missiles and drones against factories, ports and oil tankers, effectivelyshutting production down. Just prior to al-Alimi’s arrival in New York for the UNGA 79, reports surfaced claiming the PLC had failed to produce a new budget.Al-Alimiheld meetings with a number of UN officials and representatives of Western donor countries but failed to gain a public commitment for financial support. Until the PLC is able to put forth a cohesive plan to unite the country of Yemen against Houthi threats, Yemen will not receive international support. In the meantime, public unrest will only grow.

Neocons Circling A Surging Trump…Will He Bite? – OpEd	Weekend news that 'Neocon Nikki' Haley isin talks to hit the campaign trailfor Donald Trump should raise red flags to everyone cautiously optimistic that Trump 2.0 will avoid some of the personnel disasters that Trump 1.0 fell into time and time again. Haley was nicknamed 'birdbrain' by Trump in the primaries and he swore that anyone supporting her campaign would be 'permanently barred' from Trump’s MAGA camp. For her part, HaleyaccusedTrump of being 'unhinged,' 'just toxic,' and 'lacking moral clarity.' She even latched on to the left-neocon 'Russiagate' narrative that former President Trump wassoft onand even beholden to Russian president Vladimir Putin,accusingTrump of 'siding with a murderous thug.' The former US president’s son, Don, Jr. (accurately)quippedthat Haley was 'created in a laboratory by the neocons.' Now that Trump looks more likely to re-take 1600 Pennsylvania, however, Nikki’s back and ready to stump for Trump. And she’s not alone. The one thing neocons understand is how to maneuver around the shifting Washington sands of political power to make sure no matter who wins, they remain in charge. That’s why some neocons like Bill Kristol and Liz (and Papa) Cheney rallied around the Kamala train. Donald Trump has very publicly renounced and denounced many of the very people he had serving under him in his first administration, including John Bolton, Mark Esper, Mike Pence, and many others. For most of his administration it appeared his own staff was actively working against him and as soon as he was out of office most of his former 'trusted' appointeeslined up to attacktheir former boss. That is why it is also curious that Politico – a publication with a pronounced anti-Trump bias – put out apiecetoday speculating on how a Trump 2.0 Cabinet might be populated. Now Politico is far from the worst, and in fact we consult it fairly often when we are thinking about our dailyLiberty Report, but astute people in our era must consume mainstream media as in the Soviet era and look for theкто кого?– 'who whom' – of the whole thing. What is Politico really trying to say in the piece? Are they trying to inform or disrupt? At least they admit that they are 'spitballing' in their speculation about who Trump might put into top diplomatic, military, and national security positions in his 2.0 Administration if it comes to that. But apparently they base it on his references to each person and whether he gets a positive or negative comment – which itself is a bit ofKremlinology. For Secretary of State, Politico suggests that among five choices he may choose either…neocon Ric Grenell, neocon Robert O’Brien, or…drumroll…neocon 'l’il' Marco Rubio! Likewise for Defense Secretary, Politico reads the tea leaves and comes up with, among three possibilities, Sen. Tom Cotton or…drumroll…Mike 'Lie, Cheat, Steal' Pompeo!!! The bottom line is that the neocons are flocking back to the Trump world knowing that it is where the (nominal) seat of power may soon lie. They will flatter him and they will cajole those around them, and a propagandized public will smile and wink that the 'experts' are flocking to his administration. But what have these 'experts' achieved? Nothing but failure for the past 25 years, starting with the failed response to 9/11 to the idiotic attack on Iraq to the fake justification for violence embedded in the 'Arab Spring' narrative, to our current situation of being on the verge of war with Russia, Iran, China, and even BRICS. They are fully terrible, but they know how to weasel their way into power. Will Trump 2.0 finally banish these parasites to the hinterlands where they belong? 'Nikki…buh bye!'

Inside Estonia’s Defense-Tech Ecosystem – Analysis	By Joel Burke (FPRI) -- For Estonia, geography has long been destiny. The country’s proximity to various empires, many of which occupied its territory over centuries, has become a defining element of its history and culture. Today, concerns related to its border with a revanchist Russia are one of the defining features of the conversations and actions of not just those in the defense sector, but entrepreneurs, investors, and everyday citizens. Thanks to Russia’s war against Ukraine, fears of a potential Russian invasion have skyrocketed. Many in Estonia see the fight as existential not only for the Ukrainian people but also for those in countries that were previously subjugated under the yoke of Russian imperialism. However, the war in Ukraine has also brought a remarkable sense of solidarity to the country. Today, the nation is largely united in preparing for the threat of Russian aggression, with everyone playing a role. Estonia offers a unique look into how a whole-of-nation approach can be developed to counter foreign adversaries and a future defense industry in a conflict-ridden world increasingly dominated by cyber, hybrid and grey zone tactics, dual-use technologies, and AI. But while the local defense-tech ecosystem is evolving extraordinarily rapidly, it is important to examine the current status quo to understand what has allowed the country to become a defense hub so quickly. State of Play: Estonia’s Defense Environment Estonia is home to a burgeoning defense-tech ecosystem with established companies like Milrem Robotics — whose unmanned ground robots became so infamous on the Ukrainian battlefield thatRussia put out a bountyin a desperate attempt to get their hands on one — and Baltic Workboats, which is leading the development of asemi-autonomous warship platformfor EU naval forces. Just as important as these relatively established defense-tech firms, Estonia is home to one of the most dynamic early-stage defense ecosystems in the world outside of Ukraine. Startups likeFrankenburg Technologies, which plans to produce anti-drone missile systems in Ukraine, have popped up with significant fanfare.According to the CEO of the Defense Industry Association, which represents a large swath of the Estonian defense sector, total member turnover stood at €330 million in 2023 and forecasts that by 2030 their members will reach €1 billion in turnover. The rapid growth of the Estonian defense-tech ecosystem is not just due to the activities of the private sector — namely, many prominent entrepreneurs and investors in tech companies like Skype, Skeleton Technologies, and Bolt, who have increasingly turned their focus to Estonia and Ukraine’s defense —it is also due to the active support of the Estonian government. While Estonia has long met (and often exceeded) its expectations for collective defense within the NATO framework, the country has also gone above and beyond in its support for Ukraine and strengthening its domestic defense capacity. According to Dr. Justina Budginaite-Froehly’s article 'The Baltic (R)evolution in Military Affairs,' all of the Baltic states are working to increase their self-sufficiency of critical materiel production and are adjusting their legislative frameworks to facilitate the development of the sector, with Estonia 'planning several amendments to itsDefense Industry Lawto reduce unnecessary restrictions.' The Estonian government has also provided nontrivial financial support to the defense-tech sector, with then-Prime Minister Kaja Kallas greenlighting thelaunch of a 50 million euro defense industry fundin early 2024 to support local startups and Prime Minister Kristen Michalannouncingadditional funding to invest in lethal technologies in September 2024. Additionally, along with Latvia and Lithuania, the country plans to create acommon defense zonethat will contain hundreds of bunkers. Estonia’s government has a longstanding strategy of building up the cyber sector, which is seen as an environment in which Estonia both excels and could provide significant value to other NATO countries. In 2007, Estonia was hit with what may have been the first state-backedcyberattackon another sovereign nation targeting government and private-sector critical infrastructure. That attack helped catalyze support for the creation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, which has become a leading hub for the development of cybersecurity doctrine, as well as a training ground for cyber skills in NATO and nations likeJapan and Ukraine. The government’s fingerprints are also found in the private sector. Cybernetica, which works with the likes of the USOffice of Naval Research Globaland is one of the nation’s leading cyber firms, was originally part of the Tallinn-based Institute ofCyberneticsbefore being spun out into a private company that helped build key foundational elements of the country’s e-government platform. Estonia’s focus on cyber has also served as an entry point into the AI ecosystem. Tomas Jermalavičius of Estonia’s ICDS says in a2024 reportthat 'cybersecurity is viewed as a pivotal element of future secure, safe, and trustworthy AI systems, allowing Estonian companies to leverage their competitive advantages and competence in larger projects led by their Allies.' Estonia’s rise from a top startup ecosystem to a bastion of cyber excellence anda leader in e-governmentis notable, but, rapid development as a defense-tech hub may end up being the most important development in the nation’s recent history. Understanding how the country has become a leader so quickly is critical for those in the West who seek to emulate Estonia’s defense-tech ecosystem development and break out of decades of defense industry deterioration. First and foremost, the success of Estonia’s defense-tech ecosystem depends on collaboration and communication between the public and private sectors. Estonia’s Secret Sauce: Public-Private Sector Collaboration & Communication While Estonia has many geographic disadvantages, one advantage it does have is a tightly-knit community aligned around the shared goal of safeguarding its democracy and culture. This manifests in rich collaboration and communication between the public and private sectors. There are tight feedback loops between groups, which is critical when warfare innovations and adaptations mean that products and strategies must be modified in days and weeks instead of months and years. There are also robust channels for the sharing of expertise and the reduction of bureaucracy. Indeed, it is not unusual for a member of parliament or even the prime minister to be accessible by email, text, or LinkedIn to many entrepreneurs and investors in the country. Bureaucratic inertia can therefore be quickly overcome, and decisions made much more rapidly. As detailed above, the Estonian government is an ardent supporter of the tech ecosystem, providing funding and incentives and clearing roadblocks to facilitate its development. But importantly, this street goes in both directions. Since 1918, the country has depended on volunteers to augment permanent forces through the Estonian Defence League (EDL), and since 2008 this volunteer force has expanded to the cyber realm through the formation of a unit of cyber volunteers. This formalized cyber-defense support from the private sector that had already existed during critical periods like the ‘07 cyberattack. Today, the cyber forces in the EDL serve as a vital force multiplier for the country and share advances with the government gleaned from working at the bleeding edge in the private sector. This has created a virtuous cycle as volunteers leverage their expertise and knowledge of defense-sector needs into the development of private-sector startups solving real problems for the national security community. Defense The Estonian Way With only 1.3 million people and a GDP of around $38 billion, Estonia lacks the resources to counter an adversary like Russia through traditional means. It must instead focus on asymmetric tactics. A core way Estonia has done this is through the development of dual-use technologies as fiduciary constraints have forced government officials and would-be defense entrepreneurs to look for market solutions that could become commercially viable without significant government support. Even programs like NATO’s DIANA accelerator, a new startup accelerator meant to quickly develop critical technologies for NATO’s defense, are focused on dual-use technologies. Estonia’s support for dual-use technologies has deep roots. Most notably, the country’s e-government services were mostly developed by the local private sector instead of the government in the hopes that it would seed the development of a knowledge economy and ICT sector that could then expand globally. The strategy paid off handsomely with e-government implementations byEstonian companies in countries as diverse as Benin and Japan. And for Estonia, building links to other governments and critical commercial sectors is a key strategy to foster deeper ties around the world in case the country needs help from allies one day. A crucial sector in which Estonia excels is the green economy. Long a European Union priority, Estonia has also focused on supporting green initiatives through programs likeAccelerate Estonia. The private sector is intimately involved in the push to develop green technologies. For example,Skeleton Technologies, whose founder Taavi Mubarak is also a co-founder of Frankenburg Technologies, hasraised more than three hundred million eurosfor its energy solutions product line. The company produces its raw material, Curved Graphene, using EU supply chains rather than depending on China like many others in the energy sector.Estonia is also home to a Neo Performance Materials facility,which is 'the only industrial-scale and commercially operating midstream (i.e. separations) facility of rare earth elements outside of Asia.' The company is investing in developing a local permanent magnet factory for electric vehicles and wind turbines. For Estonia, every firm can serve as a dual-use venture that helps to promote domestic security, even if it builds batteries instead of bombs. Conclusion Every country is unique. Estonia’s geography and history have helped cement a consensus in the population that combating Russia is urgent and necessary. Consequently, government officials are clearing regulatory roadblocks and providing support, entrepreneurs and investors are developing new technologies and everyday citizens are volunteering to support the country (and in many cases sending money and supplies to Ukraine throughinitiatives like Adopt a Drone). While the country’s pathway to developing a vibrant and rapidly growing defense-tech sector is not universal, it still has much to teach the West. Key Lessons: Communication is Critical: By making communication with senior leaders in the private and public sectors accessible, feedback loops are tightened, and innovation is accelerated. Know Your Users’ Needs: In Estonia, the population is broadly focused on the war in Ukraine and defending against the threat of an expansionist Russia. Relations between the entrepreneurs, government officials, and everyday citizens in both countries are close, leading to the development of strong links between customers and defense tech creators, further tightening the development cycle through a better understanding of local needs. Understand Your Asymmetric Advantage: Estonia is a country of innovators, and the nation has leveraged its entrepreneurs and investors to create an asymmetric advantage through the development of dual-use technologies and capabilities such as those in the cyber realm which allowed the country to strengthen its collective defense while growing its economy. Leverage Existing Networks & Stakeholders: When the NATO DIANA accelerator expanded to Estonia, it didn’t create an entirely new structure. Instead, it leveraged the existing Tehnopol infrastructure and network, helping ramp up operations faster and immediately integrating the accelerator into the local community. Public-Private Collaboration is Critical: Estonia’s use of volunteer cyber actors shows the potential for public-private collaboration in solving pressing challenges.

Global Financial Fragilities Mount Despite Rate Cuts And Buoyant ...	When it comes to financial stability, the world is facing a split screen of short-term and medium-term factors. The good news is that near-term financial stability risks remain contained. Why? Because the likelihood of a soft landing for the global economy has significantly increased. As inflation continues to decline, major central banks have started cutting interest rates. This is boosting already buoyant asset prices and keeping financial market volatility subdued. At the same time, our latestGlobal Financial Stability Reportcalls on policymakers to remain vigilant about the medium-term prospects. We want to highlight two areas of concern. Concerns Down the Road For one, accommodative financial conditions have continued to increase vulnerabilities, such as lofty asset valuations around the world, increased government and private-sector debt levels, and more use of leverage by financial institutions, to name a few. All this could amplify future shocks to financial systems. We have seen vulnerabilities mount before, most notably ahead of the 2008 global financial crisis. The build-up is usually gradual, which should give policymakers time to adjust. The second area of concern is the disconnect between heightened uncertainty—especially related to increased geopolitical risks—and financial market volatility. A standardized measure of volatility has drifted far below geopolitical risk measures. This indicates that asset prices may not fully reflect the potential impact of wars and trade disputes. Such a disconnect makes shocks more likely, because high geopolitical tension could trigger sudden sell-offs in financial markets and prompt volatility to snap back as it catches up to uncertainty. In that case, some financial institutions may be forced to sell assets or deleverage balance sheets to meet margin calls or satisfy risk limits. While such actions may protect individual institutions, they can actually exacerbate market sell-offs. The market turmoil in early August, while not a geopolitical event, still provides a glimpse into such a scenario. The narrowing of US-Japan interest rate differentials following a rate hike by Bank of Japan in late July and a soft US payrolls report in early August led to a strengthening of the yen-dollar exchange rate. This, in turn, precipitated the unwinding of leveraged yen carry trades and spurred sell-offs in stock markets. While US stock indexes declined significantly, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index dropped by 12 percent, its largest single-day move since 1987. Other factors also exacerbated the sell-off: investors started to buy equity put options to protect against losses, driving up stock volatility especially in Japan and the United States. Meanwhile, the volatility spikes triggered risk limits for some investors like hedge funds and momentum traders, leading to further sell-offs. To be sure, market pressures proved to be temporary and did not threaten financial stability. But the sharp move by investors toward risk avoidance clearly showed how shifting sentiments can quickly amplify volatility. Another key variable for financial policymakers is the economic outlook. The IMF’s Growth-at-Risk framework links current financial conditions to the distribution of possible outcomes for future growth and sums up our current financial stability assessment. Near-term risks to growth appear contained at moderate levels: the probability of global growth falling below theWorld Economic Outlookbaseline for 2025 is estimated to be around 58 percent. And tail outcomes are not too severe owing to financial conditions having remained accommodative alongside healthy credit growth. And yet, policymakers need to be vigilant. Given the large disconnect between uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and financial market volatility, surges in volatility would likely be more prevalent. In a scenario where financial conditions tighten akin to what we saw on August 5—and remain at that level for an entire quarter—the probability of 2025 growth falling below the WEO baseline increases to around 75 percent, comparable to the peak of the COVID crisis, suggesting that downside risks could rise materially when volatility catches up to uncertainty. Time to act In short, as the global economy continues to grow, and with monetary policy easing, risk-taking by investors could increase. And thus, vulnerabilities such as debt and leverage could build up, raising downside risks in the future. So, what can policymakers do now? In countries where inflation remains stubbornly above targets, central banks should push back against overly optimistic investor expectations for monetary policy easing. Where inflation is very close, or at target, policymakers should show openness to easing faster, if evidence suggests inflation may end up undershooting the target for a while. On the fiscal side, adjustments should focus primarily on credibly rebuilding buffers to keep financing costs at reasonable levels, as shown in the IMF’s latestFiscal Monitor. We also need more progress on financial policies. Fragilities created by nonbanks using more leverage and maturity mismatches underscore the need for more active regulatory and supervisory engagement. This includes implementing the Financial Stability Board’s agreed-upon standards, the strengthening of macroprudential policy frameworks to contain excessive risk taking, and the additional collection of data to enhance transparency for market participants and policy makers alike. Furthermore, it should be ensured that central counterparties—increasingly used to clear financial transactions—remain resilient; for instance, by having sufficient liquidity to cover potential losses that may arise during periods of market stress. Now is the time for policymakers to keep a close eye on the second screen: while achieving an economic soft landing remains critical, we need to step up proactive measures to prevent future fragilities. —This article is based on Chapter 1 of the October 2024 Global Financial Stability Report.

Copernicus Was Also Right In Economics – OpEd	By Claudio Restani Nicolaus Copernicus was one of the greatest scientists in history. With his theories on astronomy, he revolutionized the sciences and is meritoriously and universally recognized as a genius. He was indeed a genius, not only in astronomy, in fact, his knowledge and studies ranged in all fields of knowledge—medicine, canon law, theology (he was also ordained Catholic theologian), natural sciences, mathematics, and—last but most important for this article—economics. Unfortunately, most people are unaware that the genius Copernicus also successfully tried his hand at economic science. He absolutely deserves to have his studies in economics highlighted so that more people can appreciate his contributions. Copernicus had, throughout his life, the great fortune of being able totravel and study in the best universities in Europe(such as Krakow, Bologna, Ferrara, and Padua) where he built a cultural background that allowed him to be able to deal with all the disciplines known and studied at the time. The value of money In the 1620s he worked in Polish Prussia to solve the monetary problems that afflicted the region. He proposed an interesting and pioneering monetary reform that denounced the fraud of the state in wanting to impose a high face value on coins with a lower commodity value and explained how this fraud was absolutely deleterious to the economy. Also, during this period and in this field of study, in 1526 he presented his short essay to the regional parliament of Prussia, in which he illustrated precisely his monetary reform. This essay is named after the LatinMonetae cudendae ratio, a title that is generally translated asOn the striking of coin. Here is an interesting excerpt from atranslationof the text: Coinage is imprinted gold or silver, by which the prices of things bought and sold are reckoned according to the regulations of any State or its ruler. Therefore money is, as it were, a common measure of values. That which ought to be a measure, however, must always preserve a fixed and constant standard. Otherwise, public order is necessarily disturbed, with buyers and sellers being cheated in many ways,... And yetanother: This [face-value] Valor is corrupted in many ways. First, the metal, alone may be defective, when for the same weight of coin more than the right amount of copper is alloyed with the silver. Secondly, the weight may be defective, even though the proportion of copper and silver is correct.… This is indicated if somewhat less silver is found in the coin than is bought with it. This is the condition in which depreciation of the coinage is properly perceived. From here Copernicus came to develop what, in the history of economic thought, is usually called Gresham’s Law, which was summarized by Sir Thomas Gresham several years later. This law concerns what happens when two types of money, one of higher quality (like gold or silver) and one of lower quality (like paper money or coins with less valuable metals), are both in circulation. This law says that when people are allowed to use both types, they tend to spend the 'bad' money (the one with less value) and keep the 'good' money (the one with more value) for themselves. This happens because people recognize that the good money is worth more, even though both types might officially have the same nominal value. Over time, the better money disappears from everyday use, and only the lower-quality money remains in circulation. Cantillon effect However, the genius of Copernicus does not end here. ReadingMonetae cudendae ratiocarefully, we can see a primordial but effective description of the Cantillon effect (which would be extrapolated by Richard Cantillon about two centuries later). The Cantillon effect describes how the entry of money into an economic system changes prices unevenly from injection points and benefits those who receive the new money first (often politicians) because they have more money today but at the prices of yesterday. The consequence is that the last to receive the new money, which has suffered inflation, are the losers. But now let’s let Copernicusexplainit: …its [inflated moneys’] calamities benefit only the goldsmiths and those who know the purity of metal by experience. For from the mixed coinage they collect the old pieces, from which they melt down the silver and sell it. From the inexperienced public they constantly receive more silver with the coinage. But after those old shillings now disappear completely, the next best are selected, while the inferior mass of money remains behind. Copernicus calls them 'goldsmiths,' but they coincide perfectly with current political elites and central bankers. At least the goldsmiths added real gold to the economy. The context and the system are different, but the fraud clearly follows the same logic of the Cantillon effect. The Copernican version is a primitive example, but the matrix is always the same: central banks can defraud the value of money by bringing benefits to those who receive the new money first—politicians/central bankers/goldsmiths—to the detriment of those who receive it last. Quantity Theory of Money A gigantic step forward in defining monetary theory based on the quantity of money in circulation was made by the School of Salamanca, in particular thanks to Martín de Azpilcueta. But Azpilcueta’s work is about 30 years posthumous compared to Copernicus, who, as Murray Rothbard points out inEconomic Thought before Adam Smith: an Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought, alreadywrote, 'We in our sluggishness…do not realize that the dearness of everything is the result of the cheapness of money. For prices increase and decrease according to the condition of the money.' Again, inMonetae cudendae ratio, he added, '...an excessive multiplicity of coinage should be avoided.' And, 'Money loses its value most of all through excessive abundance,…' It is interesting and pleasant to see how one of the greatest scientists in history had a clear understanding of the functioning of the economy and tried his hand at studying and exploring it. Copernicus applied his scientific mindset to economics, and by studying it, he indirectly confirmed what Ludwig von Mises wanted to convey with his bookLiberalism—the effective functioning of a free economy is scientifically discoverable. Every time we hear or read about Nicolaus Copernicus, we should remember him not only for the brilliant astronomer he was, but also for being a pioneering proto-economist.

Serbia Hints At New Long-Term Deal On Russian Gas	By Milica Stojanovic Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he expects Serbia and Russia to negotiate a new long-term gas supply deal after the current three-year deal expires in March. Vucic told Radio Television of Serbia that, during a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday – the first one in over two years – they had talked about natural gas supply, among other things. Serbia’s main gas supplier is Russia’s energy giant Gazprom. 'We also talked about the gas arrangement and I expect that … we will start talking about a long-term arrangement with the Russian Federation,' Vucic said on Monday evening. He added that 'we managed to provide' six million cubic metres per day for the coming season, plus another two million for Serbian oil company NIS, which is mostly owned by Gazprom and Gazprom Neft, and 'we talked about those three million additional flexible quantities of cubic metres of gas'. According to Vucic, the prices offered for these supplies 'are very good', noting that for most of them the price per cubic metre would be lower than the market rate. Serbia’s last long-term contract with Gazprom expired at the end of 2021. InNovember 2021the Serbian and Russian presidents agreed that, for the following six months, Serbia would continue to pay $270 per 1,000 cubic metres of natural gas. InMay 2022they agreed that a new three-year deal would be signed. Vucic also confirmed he will not participate in the Putin-hostedBRICS Summit in Kazanin Russia, which starts on Tuesday, but said four Serbian ministers will attend. Vucic said he has previously scheduled meetings, including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s visit on Wednesday and EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen’s at the end of the week. Vucic also said he told Putin that, even 'if there were no such visits it would be extremely difficult for me to come [to Russia] because of various things that you know well, and for which I believe you understand Serbia' – a reference to EU opposition to a membership candidate country being too close to Moscow. The Serbian delegation to the summit will comprise two US-sanctioned officials, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin and Minister Nenad Popovic, as well as Defence Minister Bratislav Gasic and Economy Minister Adrijana Mesarovic.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfVmspJtOIn0_JU5R20hQpX	2024-10-22T16:03:40-07:00	
Exploding Interest On US National Debt – OpEd	Thefinal numbersfor the U.S. government’s spending and revenues during its 2024 fiscal year have finally come in. From October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, the U.S. government’s spending exceeded its revenues by $1.833 trillion. That is the third-largest budget deficit ever recorded, and it occurred despite the federal government collecting a record amount of tax revenue during the year. The U.S. government’s total receipts were nearly $4.919 trillion, and its total outlays exceeded $6.751 trillion, the second-highest amountspentin U.S. government history. Reutersprovidessome additional comparisons for how excessive the U.S.government’sspending was during its 2024 fiscal year: The U.S. budget deficit grew to $1.833 trillion for fiscal 2024, the highest outside of the COVID era, as interest on the federal debt exceeded $1 trillion for the first time and spending grew for the Social Security retirement program, health care and the military, the Treasury Department said on Friday. The deficit for the year ended Sept. 30 was up 8%, or $138 billion, from the $1.695 trillion recorded in fiscal 2023. It was the third-largest federal deficit in U.S. history, after the pandemic relief-driven deficits of $3.132 trillion in fiscal 2020 and $2.772 trillion in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2023 deficit had been reduced by the reversal of $330 billion of costs associated with President Joe Biden’s student loan program after it was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. It would have topped $2 trillion without this anomaly. Interest Owed on the National Debt It’salmost impossible to understate how fast the amount of interest the U.S. government pays on its accumulated national debt is growing. That liability, through the end of the 2024 fiscal year, has grown to$35.465 trillion. During FY 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department paid over $1.133 trillion in gross interest on its outstanding debt securities to the nation’s creditors. The federal government pays less net interest because it is offset by interest income it collects through the trust funds it operates and other sources. Even so, the federal government paid out nearly $882 billion in net interest. Both these figures represent record-high numbers. The chart below shows how they compare with previous fiscal years from 2001 onward. Reuters explains how big 2024’s gross interest number is: The biggest driver of the year’s deficit was a 29% increase in interest costs for Treasury debt to $1.133 trillion due to a combination of higher interest rates and more debt to finance. The total exceeded outlays for the Medicare healthcare program for seniors and for defense spending. Interest paid on the national debt isn’t an ordinary outlay. Unlike other expenditures,it must be paidout of the U.S. government’s revenues. Thenation’screditors will not accept an IOU when the debt theyare owedcomes due. When such a thing happens, it’s called adefault. Lenders respond to that situation by making it even more costly for governments to borrow. Paying the Interest It Owes The Treasury Department circumvents that risk by using the cash it collects from taxesfirstto pay off debts it owes as it matures. Then, it borrows more to sustain thegovernment’sexcessive spending because it doesn’t have enough cash left to cover that cost. Because of this practice, the U.S.government’screditworthinessis not determinedby the national debt size but by its ability to service or pay back the money it owes. In FY 2024, 23% of the moneythe U.S. government collected was usedto make the gross interest payments on the U.S. national debt. That is the most of any recent presidential administration going back to 2001, as you can see in the chart below: These are bothhockey stick charts. The fast inflation of the interest the U.S. government pays its creditors during the last few years represents thearrival of a fiscal crisisthat national debt observers have long warned about. There will need to be a fiscal reckoning. This article was published at The Beacon	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfVmspJtOIn0zUy6_YYaDRd	2024-10-22T16:00:32-07:00	
The Stability Of Sudan: A Pivotal Security Dilemma In The Horn Of...	By Daniel Haile* An unstable Sudan poses a double-edged sword for its neighbors. Yet, a stable Sudan might prove even more problematic for Ethiopia and Egypt, as it could constrain their actions, driven by miscalculations rooted in uncertain fears surrounding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Ethiopia and Egypt now find themselves at a crossroads, balancing individual and collective security regarding the future of the Nile. The absence of a mutually beneficial economic, political, and security agreement—amplified by mutual suspicion—could quickly escalate into a prolonged security conflict. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi face the challenge of preserving their political authority and legitimacy. Domestically, they cannot afford to appear weak, but they must avoid losing credibility internationally, as economically, politically, and militarily vulnerable states often fall prey to regional and global powers. This has locked Abiy and Sisi in a competitive struggle over regional security, each unable to trust the other’s motives or intentions fully. This lack of trust intensifies the security dilemma, raising the question:will it culminate in a protracted conflict between Ethiopia and Egypt? Khartoum: The Sacrificial Lamb An unstable, ungovernable Sudan deepens the security dilemma for both Ethiopia and Egypt. As Africa’sthird-largest country by landmass, Sudan’s prolonged instability creates a breeding ground for Sunni Islamist non-state actors, including groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda. Ethiopia shares a753 km border with Sudan, whileEgypt’s border extends 1,220 km. Historically, Sudan has been a haven for terrorists, most notablyproviding refugeto Osama bin Laden in the 1990s and participating in the bombings ofU.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Ethiopia has long grappled with the threat of a failed state in Somalia, where itcombats Al-Shabaab, a Sunni Islamist group. Egypt, similarly, has faced an ongoinginsurgency in the Sinai Peninsulaled byWilayat Sinai, an ISIS affiliate. For both Addis Ababa and Cairo, a failed state in Sudan, particularly one that becomes a hotbed for Sunni extremists, would be catastrophic. Yet, paradoxically, both may prefer an unstable Sudan over a strong, independent one, as a fragile state serves their geopolitical and geoeconomic interests.A stable Sudan could open doors for security and economic interdependence, potentially paving the way for a tripartite agreement between Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt to manage the Nile and the filling of the GERD. On the other hand, a weak Sudan maintains the delicate balance of power between Cairo and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia cannot afford to be encircled militarily by Egypt, nor can it risk Somalia and Sudan becoming launching pads for Egyptian military actions. Meanwhile, Egypt fears a strong Sudan that might act autonomously in the region. Cairo prefers Khartoum as a vassal state, aligning Sudan’s geopolitical interests with Egypt’s, especially concerning the Nile and the GERD. The worst outcome for Cairo would be a Sudan that not only remains neutral but potentially sides with Ethiopia, forming a coalition against Egypt. Security-Driven Conflict The Horn of Africa is locked in a cycle of destabilization and proxy conflict. The civil war in Sudan offers Ethiopia a strategic opportunity to avoid being sandwiched between two Egyptian allies, Sudan and Somalia, and prevent military encirclement by Cairo. An unstable Sudan offers leverage for Ethiopia, enabling it to impose costs on Egypt and limit Cairo’s ability to expand its influence beyond Somalia. A Snapshot of the Conflict in Sudan The ongoing military conflict in Sudan, pitting the Sudanese Army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has beenexacerbated by regional and international actorsvying for control of Sudan’s geostrategic location and natural resources. The Sudanese civil war is apower struggle betweenGeneral Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as 'Hemedti,' commander of the RSF. Against the backdrop of Ethiopian-Egyptian tensions over the Nile, Sudan risks becoming a pawn in a larger game of regional power projection, further complicated by the hostilities between Cairo and Addis Ababa. From Lake Victoria and Lake Tana to the Mediterranean Is the Nile Abyssinian or Arab?In truth, it is neither. The Nile is African, belonging equally to the nations through which its waters flow, the states of theWhite and Blue Nile tributaries. The White and Blue Nile converge in Sudan to form the main Nile River, which passesthrough eleven countries: Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, and South Sudan. Egypt and Sudan must accept that the 1929 and 1959 Nile Water Agreements are obsolete, unethical, and no longer viable. These colonial-era agreements strategically excluded upstream Nile basin countries in favor of British geopolitical and geoeconomic interests. The1929 Anglo-Egyptian Treatygranted Egypt unilateral control over the Nile and veto power over projects proposed by upstream riparian states.The 1959 bilateral agreementfurther entrenched this control, effectively granting Sudan and Egypt sovereignty over the Nile River, while ignoring the rights of African nations. Notably, 86% ofthe Blue Nile originates in Ethiopia, with the remaining 14% of theWhite Nile flowingfrom Burundi, the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. These agreements are not only outdated but also unjust. A compromise that ensures equitable sharing of the Nile’s waters is necessary to address the region’s growing economic, environmental, political, and social challenges. This solution can only be achieved through negotiation and economic interdependence. Egypt must recognize that the geopolitical landscape has shifted, and it needs to embrace a new mindset at the negotiation table to avoid an all-out conflict over Nile waters. Precarious Future of Uncertainty Presently, theGERD is a symbolof Ethiopian nationalism, garnering broad domestic support for economic development. The construction of the GERD was strategically initiatedduring the Arab Spring, capitalizing on the turmoil following the fall of Hosni Mubarak. Thisunilateral action mirrorsEgypt’s construction of the Aswan Dam and Sudan’s development of the Roseires Dam. The GERD is projected to generate6,000 megawatts of energyto meet domestic consumption needs and to export excess electricity to neighboring countries. The GERD promises to lift tens of millions of Ethiopians out of poverty.With a population of 126 million, Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, yet70% of its people still lack access to electricity. Ethiopia began constructing the dam during a period of Egyptian political vulnerability, at a time when Cairo had little leverage for negotiation. Currently, Ethiopia is in thefinal stages of filling the GERD, which spans an area of 300 square kilometers— an area larger than the city of London. Cairo and Mogadishu: A Strategic Marriage of Convenience TheMemorandum of Understanding(MoU) between Ethiopia and Somaliland, which grants Ethiopia access to the port of Berbera in exchange for recognition of Somaliland’s sovereignty, has paved the way for renewed relations between Somalia and Cairo—adhering to the principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Ethiopia’s actions have inadvertently exposed it to potential military encirclement by Egypt.Cairo has signed a defense pactwith Somalia, positioning Somalia’s sovereignty as a critical component of regional stability. Egypt has followed through bysuppling two shipments of weaponsto Somalia. Currently, Somalia is demanding the withdrawal of the3,000 Ethiopian troopspresently part of theAfrican Union peacekeeping mission(ATMIS) tasked with combating Al-Shabaab by December 2024, withindications that Egyptmay send 10,000 troops to Somalia to counter non-state actors and restore order. Cairo’s political and military calculations appear strategically sound, given that Abiy Ahmed’s pursuit of sea access is a strategic maneuver aimed at consolidating his power by restructuring the state apparatus, neutralizing internal factions, rallying nationalist support, diverting attention from theTigray humanitarian crisis, and stabilizing conflicts in theAmharaandOromoregions. However, this strategy masks the deepening political, economic, and ethnic conflicts within Ethiopia, pushing the nation toward the Balkanization of Africa’s second most populous country. The current political framework in Ethiopia is unsustainable, with deep-rooted ethnic and religious divisions threatening to tear the country apart. Cairo recognizes that Ethiopia is teetering on the brink of fragmentation, reminiscent of the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Abiy Ahmed lacks a monopoly on violence, political legitimacy, and the consent of the governed. His regime is increasingly under siege, as evidenced by his struggleagainst the FANO insurgency, which represents the Amhara ethnic group,comprising 24% of the population. Complicating the crisis further, Abiy’s government is also locked in conflict with theOromo Liberation Army(OLA), which represents the interests of the Oromo, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, constituting35.8% of the population. Abiy also fought atwo-year war againsttheTigray Defense Forces(TDF), whose people account for5.7% of the population. That conflict ended withthe Pretoria Agreement, a fragile peace between the TDF and the Ethiopian government. Ethiopia is also home to the largest Somali population outside Somalia, primarily in the Ogaden region, which makes up7.2% of the population. Abiy Ahmed continues to face conflicts with Ethiopia’s four largest ethnic groups: Oromo, Amhara, Somali, and Tigray. His legitimacy and authority are rapidly eroding, leaving the Ethiopian state increasingly vulnerable to internal fragmentation.While Egypt views Ethiopia’s instability as an opportunity to undermine Abiy’s position, Addis finds itself in a security dilemma, struggling to manage its complex relationships with neighboring states. The Window for Miscalculations Between Cairo, Mogadishu, and Addis Ababa The ongoing conflict in Sudan has alreadyclaimed over 15,000 lives,displaced 8.2 million people, and left25 million in urgentneed of humanitarian aid. As the situation worsens, Libya and Syria could become mere footnotes compared to Sudan’s unfolding crisis. The dispute over the Nile has transformed Sudan into a battleground for Egyptian and Ethiopian influence, undermining Sudan’s territorial integrity. Egypt appears to be building a coalition to contain Ethiopia, with all eyes on Eritrea, where Egyptian and Somali leaders areconvening for a tripartite summiton regional political and security cooperation. What are the potential ramifications of this meeting for Sudan?Suppose Egypt and Ethiopia perceive the current political and military climate surrounding the GERD as an existential threat to their interests and survival. In that case, Cairo and Addis will be incentivized to destabilize Sudan further to maintain the balance of power and regional leverage. The stakes are exceptionally high for Ethiopia, a nation fragmented along ethnic, religious, and linguistic lines. The Ethiopian government views astable and united Somaliaas a potential threat, particularly given the historical precedent ofthe Ogaden War in 1977, when Somalia nearly succeeded in annexing Ethiopia’s Ogaden region. A stable Somalia poses a significant threat to Ethiopia, as it could revive questions about theOgaden region’s statuswithin Ethiopian borders. As Somalis comprise 7.2% of Ethiopia’s population, Somali nationalism remains a persistent source of tension between the two countries. Conclusion: The Path Ahead The strategic stakes in Sudan and the surrounding region are precariously high, and the power dynamics are rapidly shifting. The conflict in Sudan cannot be viewed in isolation—it is a critical moment in the broader security landscape of the Horn of Africa. Sudan’s stability is now a pivotal security dilemma, entangling Ethiopia and Egypt in a complex struggle shaped by their historical legacies, contemporary challenges, and the pressing need for cooperative diplomacy between Cairo and Addis. Ethiopia and Egypt’s actions underscore the urgent need for a peaceful resolution to the GERD crisis; failing to do so risks escalating conflict among riparian states and undermining regional stability. Cairo and Addis must acknowledge their economic, political, and security interdependence, viewing the Nile as a bridge for peace rather than a source of conflict. Genuine collaboration that addresses the needs of both parties can transform the current security dilemma into an opportunity for mutually assured economic and political development. The relationship between Cairo and Mogadishu could metamorphose from a transactional alignment against Ethiopia into a strategic partnership if Cairo and Addis fail to resolve their differences, turning the Horn of Africa into contested ground for regional influence.

How Did Elon Musk Become The Richest Person On Earth? – OpEd	Once upon a time, here in the United States, wetaxedthe rich. Significantly. Today, by contrast, we’re actively enhancing their fortunes. Including the biggest personal fortune of them all, the quarter-trillion-dollar stash that belongs to Elon Musk, the currentnumero unoon theForbesreal-time listof the world’s largest fortunes. Musk owes a hefty chunk of his own personal fortune to the taxes average Americans pay. He just happens to be,notesa just-publishedPoliticoanalysis, 'the single biggest beneficiary of U.S. government contracts.' Two of Musk’s commercial operations, Tesla and SpaceX, have received billions in American taxpayer support. The federal government,Politicopoints out, has essentially 'outsourced its space program' to SpaceX, and Tesla, a shaky electric vehicle company when Musk bought it, only 'took off after receiving $465 million in subsidies from the Obama administration in 2010.' All the tax dollars that Musk has collected from the Defense Department, NASA, and the U.S. intelligence community — coupled with the 'generous government subsidies and tax credits to the electric-vehicle industry' that have so boosted Musk’s Tesla — have Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Max Boot fairly fuming. Taxpayers like himself, Bootnotes, are subsidizing the 'fire hose of falsehoods' that now appear on X, the former Twitter, the social media app that Muskboughtfor $44 billion two years ago. Our tax dollars have essentially supersized our world’s single wealthiest individual. Back in the middle of the 20th century, the United States took quite a different approach to the money pouring into rich people’s pockets. From the early 1940s through the mid-1960s, the incomes of America’s richest faced a tax bite that would be unimaginable today. In 1942, then-president Franklin Rooseveltproposeda 100 percent tax rate on income over $25,000, the equivalent of about $484,000 today. Congress wouldn’t go along with that 100 percent top rate. But lawmakers did give the okay to a 94 percenttop tax rateon 1944 income over $200,000. In the 1950s, under the Republican president Dwight Eisenhower, the federal tax rate on top-bracket income never dipped below 91 percent. Today’s top-bracket federal income tax rate? Thatstands, on paper, at 37 percent on income over $693,751 for a couple filing jointly. But assorted loopholes have left the tax rate the rich face on their actual annual gains enormously lower. In 2021, ajoint reportfrom the Biden administration’s Office of Management and Budget and Council of Economic Advisers calculated that America’s wealthiest 400 billionaire families, between 2010 and 2018, 'paid an average of just 8.2 percent of their income' — counting the gains in the value of their investments — in federal individual income taxes. 'That’s a lower rate,' the report noted, 'than many ordinary Americans pay.' Could we ever get back to anything close to Eisenhower-era tax rates on the richest among us? This past March, the Biden administrationproposeda 25 percent minimum tax on the total income — including unrealized capital gains — of the nation’s top 0.01 percent, households worth at least $100 million. About the same time, progressive lawmakers — led by U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and representatives Pramila Jayapal from Washington State and Brendan Boyle from Pennsylvania — introducedthe Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, legislation that would impose a wealth tax on America’s 100,000 wealthiest households, our richest 0.05 percent. Under this proposed legislation, wealthy households worth up to $1 billion would face an annual tax of 2 percent on their wealth over $50 million. Richer households would face an additional 1 percent tax on wealth over $1 billion. One of the Senate co-sponsors of that legislation, Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, has also gone a step further and called for a 100 percent tax on wealth over $1 billion. 'I think people can make it on $999 million,' Sanderstoldjournalist Chris Wallace last year. Sanders and one of America’s most famous deep pockets, Bill Gates, have actually had afriendlypodcast discussion over whether our tax rates should allow billion-dollar fortunes to even exist. The Sanders proposal, noted Gates, would tax away over 99 percent of his personal fortune. Gates would be willing to let the IRStake62 percent, about $100 billion. For a better America, that certainly might make a good place to start.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfVmspJtOIn0__IMdCVDzTh	2024-10-22T15:56:28-07:00	
How The Built Environment Is Damaging Children’s Connection To Na...	Profit-driven urban development has disconnected us—particularly children—from the wilderness. The effects are unhealthy. The free-roaming range of a child has been reduced dramatically in only a few generations. About three generations ago, most children were free to travel the full range of their town, but they rarely went beyond it except when accompanied by adults. Two generations ago, children biked and walked freely within a few miles of their homes through developed and wild areas, often spending days without supervision. One generation ago, most children were restricted to biking or walking a few local blocks and playing in their backyards, and they were generally supervised for their safety. The current generation of children is mainly limited to the home and garden and allowed only supervised, organized play outdoors. This restriction in range limits children's ability to explore their world without fear and to understand the complexity of the real world. Just as the child's exploring range has been restricted, so has the child's personal mobility range. The parent is obliged to 'walk' the child in a stroller, or they might run or toddle off the narrow sidewalk into the fast traffic rumbling down every street. Parents working on tasks cannot rely on community supervision and are forced to sit children in front of screens indoors to occupy their attention. Parents often have no wild, natural environment nearby for children to play in, so they move the child from the stroller to a manufactured play structure. Parents often must get everywhere by car, which keeps the child strapped in a car seat. When the parents have more than one child, it is much harder to protect the children, so the mobility restrictions increase. A Global Issue This is more than just a North American problem. A 2004studyled by Professor John Reilly at the University of Glasgow and published in the Lancet showed that three-year-old Scottish children spent an average of only 20 minutes a day actively mobile. The rest of the time was spent in mobility-restricting strollers, beds, highchairs, or baby seats—usually in front of a digital screen. Every parent knows that children need good nutrition, adequate rest, and lots of free time to play outdoors in the fresh air and sunshine to thrive. How could we have forgotten the importance of this last piece in our universal child-rearing conventions? Scientificevidencelinks less time playing outdoors in the sunlight with poor eyesight, specifically myopia. In China and East Asia, as many as90 percentof high school graduates are near-sighted. The incidence of myopia in the Americas has increased by around66 percent between 1971 and 2004. A 2023studyled by Bryana Banashefski at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine found that two out of every five Americans have myopia. What is going on?Researchpublished in JAMA Ophthalmology indicts sunshine, or the lack of it, for permanently changing the shape of children's eyeballs. Children spending less time outdoors and experiencing less sunshine grow into myopic adults. I was the only person, child or adult, in my family to need glasses. I was also the least outdoorsy so I can relate to this. How did the exploration and mobility range of children worldwide become so restricted in just a single generation? Profit Trumps Nature Much of the blame can be laid on the design, development, and construction industry. To increase profit, we have densified our cities to the point where children have no safe, natural places to play and no wild areas to escape to. In many cases, kids are restricted to a couple of lots dedicated as park areas that consist of grass and a bit of manufactured play equipment. The inevitable consequence of this lack of safe and engaging outdoor play space is that children are kept home for their own safety and learn to play quietly with technology. But the issue is more profound than this. As we remove large semi-wild parklands and play areas from our communities, we restrict the opportunity for our children—and ourselves—to explore and develop a comfort level with these environs. When we are not comfortable with wild nature, we discourage our children from exploring it. So, we have created a positive feedback cycle. In many cities,children cannot name even one local bird. We do not protect what we cannot name. As we reduce the areas of wild nature in our cities because of development pressure, we increase our fear of it and reduce our children's time in the remaining wilderness areas. As we reduce our own and our children's playtime in wild nature, the benefit and use of these spaces diminishes, and the protection of these spaces is reduced, allowing their unopposed destruction and development as urban areas. Because of this strange and unhealthy positive feedback, we find ourselves valuing wild lands less, even as they become much scarcer. Dismal School Statistics The children themselves are telling us through dismal school statistics about escalating special needs (now 10 percent of all children, per the2023 World Happiness Report), poor physical fitness, and lowering academic scores, that there is something terribly wrong with the way we have designed their world. For instance, daycares are set up to provide safe sleeping and playing areas inside. Still, outdoor play areas are often hard surfaces with intricate manufactured play sculptures, usually fenced off and opening onto parking areas. What are these children imprinting? As we work toward a solution, we must avoid getting swayed by the arguments favoring structured sports over unstructured playtime. The hard, regular surfaces required for many sports are anathema to the creative soul. These spaces do not provide the mystery and magic needed by our exploring young minds, nor do they encompass the myriad creatures caught up in even the smallest ecosystem for the child to connect with and develop empathy for. Just like our children, we adults feel refreshed when we catch the early morning light filtered through trees, walk green tree-lined streets filled with birdsongs to work, gaze out at changing skies and landscapes from our place of employment, take breaks in beautiful gardens, walk home and indulge in a stroll after dinner, and fall asleep to the night sounds of tiny insects, breezes, and rustling leaves. This idyllic imaginary day was the norm for most families only a generation or two ago. For most of us, it is a dream we are unlikely to manifest. We wake to the traffic sounds and smells of a busy city, take crowded transit or a busy freeway to work, eat our lunch at our desk or in a crowded cafe, take transit or the freeway home, and then stay indoors in front of a screen and fall asleep to the noise of traffic and the city. For those who live in the suburbs, the home environment might be a little more connected to nature's sights and smells, but the long commute significantly offsets the overall benefit. Quantifying Poor Urban Design Some programs can help quantify the effects of poor urban design. For example, theWELL Building Standarddeveloped by theInternational WELL Building Institute(IWBI) 'is a performance-based system for measuring, certifying, and monitoring features of the built environment that impact human health and well-being, through air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort, and mind.' Another resource is theHealth Impact Assessment (HIA) Resource and Toolkit Compilation, a set of tools, guidelines, and processes used to evaluate the potential health effects of a policy, program, or project before implementation, helping decision-makers maximize positive health outcomes and minimize adverse effects. These programs tell us that without access to walkable districts, adults grow fat and develop diabetes and heart disease. They also tell us that adults develop respiratory diseases without the fresh air created by natural environments. Further research is connecting the dots, but we know that dealing with the stress of constant crowds creates afight-or-flight responsein some adults. Chronically high levels of cortisol, released by the adrenals in response to stress, can lead to cancer, heart disease, and a host of other conditions, including a mental breakdown. Adult mental illness is an epidemic in our developed nations and is triggering a hard look at the way we force ourselves to live now in our so-called modern world. Unnatural Green Building Trend How did we arrive at this point where so many of our children have no exposure to nature and where time spent in a wild environment is just a memory for most adults? Where we are stressed almost from birth by roads and construction, unrelieved by trees and gardens? In my career, I have resisted designing places I would not live or work in myself, but there is constant pressure on all designers to make living spaces smaller and to eliminate wild areas. There is additional pressure to widen roads and build deeper parking garages. We design apartments that are too small, condos that have no privacy, communities with no access to green space, schools without safe walking paths and natural playgrounds, hospitals that are completely mechanistic and inhuman, universities without daylit classrooms and adequate natural retreat spaces, and office buildings with no connection to nature at all. Our builders, developers, engineers, and architects have convinced us that we cannot afford any other option. We have come to believe this as individuals and as communities. The truth is that we have all allowed an untenable situation to develop without questioning it. Before exploring what it means to address these issues, it is necessary to understand what natural development is not. I see an ironic trend toward unnatural green buildings worldwide. This happens when we use a mechanistic approach to design something 'naturally.' We are so lost in a mechanistic design paradigm that we confuse imitating nature with constructing in harmony with it. My personal experience with this was when I visited Singapore for a World Architecture Festival event. Once a year, architects from across the globe gather in a selected city to celebrate the world's best architecture. In 2012,Gardens by the Bayin SingaporewontheWorld Building of the Year Award. It consists of a massive island formed from dredged sand; the island features gardens built on themes from around the world. The highlight of the gardens is a series of artificial 'trees,' which light up at night for a sound and light show. The trees are major steel constructions featuring a walkway connecting the canopies. Somewhere in the middle of the 'tree canopy,' there is a bar from which you can view the Singapore skyline with a drink in your hand. While all of it is quite over the top, my disconnected moment resulted from a queer juxtaposition. The open gardens are spectacular but uncomfortable in the heat of the day, so they are mostly used at night. It was a hot day. I decided to go to the enclosed and cooled part of the gardens. I visited the rainforest garden to refresh myself just before my long flight home. I wandered through artificial waterfall mists, walked up a constructed mountain, meandered through transplanted rainforests, and arrived at the geodesic dome on top of it all. Then I walked back down and flew home. The next day, my husband and I walked through a mountainside rainforest in our community for a refreshing stroll along a river. I glanced up, momentarily disoriented, and looked for the dome. In crowded Singapore, the diorama may feel like the real thing and even momentarily fool a rainforest hiker like me, but it is not real. Many so-called sustainable buildings have so much technology operating them that the real intent and original feel of the design are lost in the complexity of the mechanical solution. Award-winning buildings designed as machines in organic shapes to imitate opening shells or wings are also not natural. This intensely fabricated nature ultimately has a disturbing effect on the adult human psyche, especially on the open and creative mind. We must be clear about our objectives and protect our natural systems. We must provide daily access to real nature in all communities to restore our true health and vitality. However, this is not the direction we are going in. TheeVolo Skyscraper Competitioninvites futuristic architectural solutions to overcrowding, global warming, and environmental disasters. In 2024, the first-place winner was an alarming vision of massive glazed buildings 'slicing' through a city to add density. While optimistically seeking to restore the Yellow River, the second-place winner proposes mechanical arms printing modular units on both sides of the river, using river silt that is converted to raw material for 3D printing. The third-place winner proposes a massive inverted skyscraper 1 kilometer below the ocean surface to act as a carbon scrubber and artificial reef builder. It seems that young imaginations around the world are exploring the future as a fabricated realm of artificial skyscrapers floating or supported above the earth. The apparent disconnect with natural physics is astounding. While it is true that these are only thought experiments and not to be taken seriously as future construction projects, they nevertheless represent a current fascination with extremely artificial environments and a rejection of wild nature. Imposing such exotic construction on an already stressed and fragile planet—and our stressed and fragile psyches—is not the solution. We must turn this ship around now and move toward elegant, simple solutions in harmony with natural forces. This is the only way to comprehensively address the real and complex problems of neighborhood planning for the urban populations we anticipate in the next century. How We Might Rewild Our Cities Contact with nature nurtures us into a state of relaxation that supports our health and the development of our intelligence, sociability, and creativity. When we remove contact with nature from our world, we live a circumscribed existence that increases anxiety and fear and compromises creativity. Social tensions arise when we are too crowded without the relief provided by parks and waterways. Architects, developers, designers, builders, urban planners, and policymakers should ensure that buildings are connected to natural light, views, and sounds. We must build garden-based communities with real links to waterways and wild nature. We must redefine the postindustrial city. For a happier and healthier future for our children, we must rewild our built environments.

Vatican-China Bishop Deal Renewed For Four More Years	By Courtney Mares The Vatican announced Tuesday that it has renewed its agreement with China on the appointment of Catholic bishops for an additional four years. The renewal comes days after areportfrom the Hudson Institute detailed how sevenCatholic bishops in Chinahave been detained without due process, while other bishops have experienced intense pressure, surveillance, and police investigations since the Sino-Vatican agreement was initially signed six years ago. With the extension, the Sino-Vatican agreement will now remain in effect until Oct. 22, 2028. The English translation of the official statement from the Holy See said that 'the Vatican party remains dedicated to furthering the respectful and constructive dialogue with the Chinese party, in view of the further development of bilateral relations for the benefit of the Catholic Church in China and the Chinese people as a whole.' The statement added that both sides agreed to extend the provisional agreement after 'appropriate consultation and assessment.' China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian also confirmed the extension, saying that the two sides would maintain 'contact and dialogue following a constructive spirit,' according to the Associated Press. Originally signed in September 2018, the provisional agreement was previously renewed for a two-year period in 2020 and again in October 2022. The terms of the agreement have not been made public, though Pope Francis has said it includesa joint commissionbetween the Chinese government and the Vatican on the appointment of Catholic bishops, overseen by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin. The Vatican’s dialogue with China has not always been smooth. The Holy See has acknowledged thatChina violated the termsof the agreement by unilaterally appointing Catholicbishops in Shanghaiand the'diocese of Jiangxi,'a large diocese created by the Chinese government that is not recognized by the Vatican. Pope Francis expressed satisfaction with the ongoing dialogue with China duringa press conferencein September. However, the Vatican’s foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, has been more cautious, calling the agreement'not the best deal possible'and noting ongoing efforts to improve its implementation. Since 2018, 'about 10 bishops' have been appointed and consecrated under the terms of the Sino-Vatican agreement, according to Vatican News. Anew coadjutor bishop of Beijingis expected to be installed this Friday in agreement with the Vatican, according to Asia News. The coadjutor bishop would be just five years younger than Beijing’s current Archbishop Joseph Li Shan, who is still more than a decade away from the typical retirement age for Catholic bishops. In August, the Chinese government officially recognized 95-year-oldBishop Melchior Shi Hongzhen, a former underground bishop. The Vatican called this recognition a 'positive fruit of the dialogue' with Beijing. Human rights advocates have criticized the Vatican’s silence on China’s religious freedom violations during its negotiations, including the internment of Uyghur Muslims and the imprisonment of democracy advocates like Catholic Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have reportedly ordered the removal of crosses from churches and have replaced images of Christ and the Virgin Mary with images of President Xi Jinping, according to arecent reportfrom the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). USCIRF also reports that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) 'sinicization of religion' campaign has led to censored religious texts, forced clergy to preach CCP ideology, and required the display of CCP slogans in churches. 'While some Catholics choose to worship legally within the state-controlled Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, they are certainly not free as they must comply with the CCP’s harsh mechanisms of control and interference,' USCIRF Commissioner Asif Mahmoodtold CNAearlier this month. 'Ultimately, the Chinese government is solely interested in instilling unwavering obedience and devotion to the CCP, its political agenda, and its vision for religion, not protecting the religious freedom rights of Catholics,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfVmspJtOIn0z9FIVIytyu3	2024-10-22T15:52:57-07:00	
Ralph Nader On October 19th Unconditional Endorsement Of Harris/W...	The October 19, 2024 endorsement of the Harris/Walz Democratic ticket for the Presidency and Vice Presidency by over fifty Lebanese Americans (perhaps some reluctantly) reads as if the Biden Bombs for Israel are not daily destroying more of Lebanon and its civilians with an emerging genocidal pattern as seen in Gaza over the past year. Israel’s terrorism against innocent civilians, health facilities, cafes, residential areas, schools, agricultural terrains, transportation routes, and even banks, are receiving so far the full, cruel support of the Biden/Harris Administration. So where is the storied Lebanese tradition of tough negotiation or bargaining? The statement failed to condition this support on the White House’s making immediate enforceable demands on Israel to stop this mass annihilation, including women, children, the elderly, and hospital patients, immediately. There is no indication of any reciprocity, simply a plea without any display of political power on behalf of the Lebanese American community. After all, there are over a million Lebanese American voters that the Democratic Party should be keeping in mind. The letter should have given Bibi-Biden a sense of urgency by informing him that over 80,000 Americans reside in Lebanon and that there are two major educational institutions there – the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the Lebanese American University (LAU) with extensions in the Bekaa Valley, along with other American business, cultural and charitable enterprises. Any day now, Netanyahu’s murderous bombing raids against a totally defenseless country will claim the lives of Americans there. (Israel has already bombed the ancestral village of one of the signers of the letter.) TheWashingtonPostreports that Israel has already bombed several Christian villages. What is Joe Biden going to do? The Lebanese American community should let Biden know he and Democratic candidates will pay a political price should he not put a stop to this indiscriminate air and ground attack on its ally and the additional violence against the United Nations peacekeepers in the south. The letter has long-term proposals for peace and a rebuilding of Lebanon’s economy and governing institutions which are well taken. But as Martin Luther King Jr. once exclaimed: 'THE URGENCY OF NOW' is on the table. History reminds us that Hezbollah was created in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, dominating and abusing the unprotected Shiite Lebanese in the south. The Israeli practice of collective punishment and limitless civilian destruction over the years is now underway again in this small country. (TheWashington Postreports 1.2 million Lebanese have been displaced in just one week). The letter does not do justice to this slaughter that is going on right now with full Biden/Harris backing. It should have a follow-up addendum immediately foran emergency demandthat Biden pressure Netanyahu to cease attacking an American ally. With consequences if denied. Now! Don’t you think the bombarded Lebanese people expect at least that much from the signatories? Postscript:One of the signers is Ralph Nader of New York City. The gentleman is no relation. There should be no confusion of names here.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfVmspJtOIn0-1y71TFsyma	2024-10-22T15:51:27-07:00	
Clean Technology Ecosystem In Asia Pacific Key To Regional Prospe...	By Marina Yue Zhang and Muyi Yang As heatwaves, flooding and droughtsbecome more frequentand severe, the need for global climate cooperation has never been greater. But at this crucial juncture, the world faces a significant collective action dilemma, particularly regarding China. While working with China is recognised as essential for global efforts to limit temperature rises, China is often seen as a risk in the clean technology sector. This includes solar panels, batteries andelectric vehicles— all crucial tools for decarbonising the energy sector. Dependence on these technologies is a vulnerability in global supply chains. Yet few countries are willing to bear the economic costs of decoupling from China.Strategies like‘diversification’ and ‘China-Plus-One’ have emerged as pragmatic alternatives in the clean energy transition. These approaches aim to maintain engagement with China while reducing reliance on Chinese suppliers by fostering more resilient supply chains and partnerships. China leads the global clean technology industry supply chain — from critical mineral production to value-added processing and downstream manufacturing. Other Asia Pacific countries possess advantages such as resource endowments, local market potential and labour advantages. But these advantages alone will not guarantee a thriving clean technology industry. Clean industrial development requires extensive efforts to foster an ecosystem. Companies must both collaborate and compete across the entire supply chain, including in raw material supply, research, infrastructure and manufacturing. China’s success is illustrative. Initially reliant on imports, its current dominance in clean technology is the result ofdecades of sustained policy support. This extendsbeyond subsidies and targets, involving long-term investment, research and development backing and the development of integrated industrial clusters. With this supportive policy environment, Chinese companies have actively engaged in innovation rather thancopying foreign technologies. Byleveragingcollaborationwithinternational partners, they have built aglobal competitive edge. Even with China’s highly supportive policies, it took decades for its companies to achieve this success. By the timelocal supply chainsin Asia Pacific countries take shape, they may find themselves lagging even further behind as Chinese companies continue to improve technologies and cost efficiency. Establishing a clean technology ecosystem in the Asia Pacific represents a promising strategyforacceleratingthelearning curveacross the region by leveragingChinese technology know-how and industrial strengths. Tapping into the complementary strengths of Asia Pacific nations — such as raw materials, technological expertise, market demand, skilled labour and geographic proximity — holdssignificant potentialfor industrial upgrading, economic growth and job creation. Utilising the region’s rich clean energy resources provides opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint associated with the energy-intensive segments of clean technology industries, such asraw material processing. Rather than offshoring the manufacturing of clean technology products to regional neighbours, this strategy offers substantial opportunities to elevate China’s clean technology industry from a production-focused model to one that is more service and innovation oriented. This transition will particularly benefit theproducer services sector— the ‘software’ of China’s clean technology industry — specialising in providing tailored services such as consulting, design, advisory and technical support for product manufacturing. While some might question the practicality of such cooperation with China due to rising concerns about economic resilience and national security, building a regional clean technology ecosystem could help address these issues. In a regional system with overlapping and mutually reinforcing supply chains, complex dependencies emerge among countries at various stages of the supply chain. While some nations may have greater control overspecificparts, no single country dominates the entire ecosystem, making it much harder for any one country to effectively weaponise economic interdependence. More diversified regional supply chains could enhance Asia Pacific countries’ ability to navigate geopolitical dynamics, as having multiple sources for similar products and access to different markets provides greater flexibility and resilience in the face of political and economic turbulence. Collective efforts have already begun to foster clean industries across the Asia Pacific, with significant Chinese investment flowing into Southeast Asia, largely driven byfierce competition at homeandnarrowing prospectsin Western markets. Moving forward, existing efforts driven by short-termism will not suffice. More coordinated actions, facilitated by regional and multilateral frameworks, are necessary to guide the long-term development of clean industries and address practical issues that may arise along the way. For decades, increased economic cooperation — through more intensive cross-border trade, technology transfer and joint research and investment — has been the cornerstone of socio-economic progress, especially for trade-dependent Asia Pacific economies. Staying on this path, rather than reverting to fragmentation, is crucial for realising their clean industrialisation ambitions. This approach will ensure access to external markets, cross-cutting technologies, innovation capabilities and financial resources, including those from China, all of which are essential for driving the region’s transition to a sustainable and prosperous future.

Welcome To BRICS+: The Economic Power Of Multipolar World – Analy...	The developing world arrived in Kazan, the capital of Republic of Tatarstan, driving by economic transformation proposals backed by the numerical strength of participants to portray their collective weight of influence to boost de-dollarization and a new global financial payment system, design a new mechanism for a long-term economic integration and complex architecture. For much of its significant collective activities these past several years, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) has been viewed and described from perspectives of supporting the economic development in the Global South, Southeast Asia and Africa. Unpacking some of the official statements and positions over proposals awaiting discussions at the summit indicate the brightness of multipolar world. These past 30 years Russia is steadily building its market economy and its related institutions. Transitioning to a market economy is not easy, while China, India and many potential BRICS members have arguable variations in political, economic and cultural capabilities. Notwithstanding some level of disagreements and divergencies of ideas, China and Russia have consistently asked its partners to create an alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to counter political pressure from Western nations ahead of the BRICS summit this late October. Arguably Western countries tightly control the global financial system, and that the group, which represents 37% of the global economy, therefore it beholds on BRICS to create an alternative. Some BRICS experts have underlined in reports that the IMF and the World Bank are unsuccessfully performing their roles. Top BRICS finance and central bank officials, a few weeks before the summit meeting, acknowledged the urgent necessity to form new conditions or even new institutions, similar to the Bretton Woods institutions, but within the framework of the community, within the framework of BRICS+. For instance, Russia had its forex reserves in dollars and euros frozen and its financial system heavily hit by sanctions by the West after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. As expected, Russia has been cut off from international capital markets. In addition, Russia has also experienced delays in international transactions with its trading partners, including BRICS member countries, as banks in these countries fear punitive actions from Western regulators. Beyond that the New Development Bank proposed setting up a joint investment platform which will use a new digital form of transactions among members. That has been the critical reason why Central Bank officials and Finance Ministers of BRICS+ are pushing to implement stringent measures including BRICS Bridge payments system, which would link member countries' financial systems, but progress has been slow. As already known, the only financial institution the BRICS countries have established so far is the New Development Bank, created in 2015 to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS members and other emerging economies. Mihaela Papa, director of research and principal research scientist at the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-author of the 2022 book: 'Can BRICS De-dollarize the Global Financial System?' has argued that BRICS+ needs to strategically innovate to show practical influence in their operations. 'With BRICS doubling its membership in 2024, new members are expected to support existing BRICS agendas,' she said in a critical written interview with Bloomberg News. 'A key question is whether they can innovate together.' The core principles of BRICS have resonated with the Global South. The BRICS ‘brand’ is linked to positive economic prospects and growth, as well as the ambition to diversify global leadership, promote development, and modernize multilateral institutions. BRICS has actively engaged Global South countries through outreach efforts, emphasizing non-ideological and mutually beneficial economic cooperation. BRICS' risk management credentials have grown since early 2022. Countries in the Global South have observed the freezing of Russia's reserves while facing the consequences of a stronger US dollar. This led many to question their heavy reliance on the dollar, which BRICS seeks to address. States applying to join BRICS cite reasons like strengthening South-South trade and financial cooperation, supporting multilateralism, and enhancing their global role. While BRICS members have differing views on major geopolitical conflicts, their solidarity and cultivation of non-Western narratives increase the association's hedging value. Therefore, it does not matter whether BRICS, or the unification of China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Iran and Turkey, will be more viable or not. The main thing is that the process of searching for new models by the states dissatisfied with the United States policy has started, which means the end of the dominance of the United States in all spheres of international relations. At some point, the West, headed by the United States, will have to negotiate new models of international economic and other relations, based on new international treaties that ensure equality of all states. A multi-year study at Tufts University published in July 2023, for instance, found that the 'BRICS countries connect around common development interests and quest for a multipolar world order in which no single power dominates. Yet BRICS consolidation has turned the association into a potent negotiation force that now challenges Washington's geopolitical and economic goals.' Moreover, de-dollarization would undermine the effectiveness of US sanctions, relying on the SWIFT system, as BRICS seeks alternative financial systems, potentially making SWIFT obsolete. As for a common BRICS currency, it is currently not under priority consideration. The time has not come yet. The introduction of BRICS currency has to be treated with uttermost caution, without any haste, as the members' economies by their structure, effectiveness, should be approximately equal, or would have the same problems, even more than the problems that arose in the European Union, when a common currency was introduced for those countries, whose economic levels were comparable. Western analysts and experts have highlighted potential divisions and weaknesses in the association, including significant economic instabilities, disagreements among the members over security reforms and over territorial issues especially between China and India. There are existing conflicts between Egypt and Ethiopia too. As many countries join BRICS, as also fresh contradictions would arise within the association in future. Despite their rivalries, China and India have been deepening their cooperation through BRICS. The demand for BRICS membership is high, skepticism about its ideological direction and benefits is also increasing. Argentina has withdrawn, Saudi Arabia is undecided, Indonesia is not ready, and Mexico is uninterested. After Soviet's collapse in 1991, Russia abandoned Africa paving the pathways for China's entry. For the past three decades, China has exerted its economic power in the continent, as part of its remote dream to become global economic power. Against this backdrop, BRICS platform is important to China to strengthen its economic power. China has seemingly capitalized on Russia's economic weaknesses in former Soviet republics, passionately consolidating its economic tentacles and beyond that one should be really critical to examine how China is transiting strategically into Europe. Its primary goal is to expand economic influence and access to European markets. As the situation stands, Russia and European Union are at logger-head due to 'special military operation' in neighboring Ukraine. Obviously, with prospects of strengthening the association, Russia stands to gain significantly especially this time of shifting geopolitical situation. At the group's 10th parliamentary forum in July 2024, Putin particularly noted that 'openness, fairness and equality are the principles that unite BRICS countries.' In this sense, interaction with the countries in the regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America will undoubtedly bolster Russia's global political status and overcome restrictions or sanctions. Southeast Asian and African countries view BRICS as a significant player in the evolving global landscape. They see it as an opportunity to strengthen their economic positions, diversify partnerships and assert their interest on the world stage. The growing interest from south east Asia and Africa in joining BRICS reflects a broader desire for a multipolar world where emerging economies can collaborate more effectively on the world stage. The principal feature, especially in official statements and in media reports, it should not be perceived as an anti-Western association. It's simply non-Western, with a focus on attaining common goal of sustainable development and prosperity for members on the basis of multilateral Global South. Therefore, supporting business activity and enterprise is considered a priority for leaders of all BRICS countries. As always with much fortitude, Russia is consistently convincing China and India to support building common consensus to enlarge BRICS, which seeks to shape a multipolar global order in place of the fading era of Western dominance. Founded 15 years ago by Brazil, Russia, India and China as BRIC, the group, with the addition of South Africa in 2011, became BRICS. And with this year's entry of five additional countries, it has become BRICS-plus, accounting for nearly half the world's population and 40 percent of global trade. Reiterating here that BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeghCnAEweo2CmjJbI5_Rua	2024-10-22T09:44:42-07:00	
Sir Syed Ahmed Khan And The Muslim Renaissance In South Asia – An...	This year marks the 207th birth anniversary of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, born into a prominent family with ties to the Mughal court in Delhi on October 17, 1817, and who passed away on March 27, 1898. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan played a pivotal role in the Muslim Renaissance of the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century. His family’s aristocratic background provided him with access to both traditional Islamic education and the evolving intellectual currents of his time. He was a pioneering socio-religious reformer, but his legacy is complex and subject to various critiques. His contributions primarily focused on modernizing the Muslim community, which was struggling in the aftermath of the fall of the Mughal Empire and the subsequent rise of the British colonial rule. One of his most remarkable contributions was in the field of education. He recognized that the Muslims had fallen behind due to their reluctance to accept the Western education and sciences, largely sticking to traditional religious studies. The Muslim renaissance is said to have begun with Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. He was a forerunner of socio-cultural transformations in the Muslim community through the Aligarh Movement (AM, hereafter). There have been a few individuals whose ideas, thoughts, beliefs and actions took so much time to evolve and reach their final shape as in the case of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. To bring a change in the Muslim attitude, he launched the Islamic Renaissance by means of his writings and the AM. For him, the Western science and technology strengthened Islamic convictions, since Islam was not dialectically opposed to reasoning and rationalism. This article focuses on the contributions and legacy of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s AM in awakening the Muslim community in the Indian subcontinent, with special reference to colonial Bengal. To provide an appropriate context for this analysis, a brief discussion on the historical evolution is presented in the following section. Before the arrival of the British, peace and order prevailed in Bengal in almost all religious, social and political areas. Bengal was known as one of the wealthiest provinces of the Mughal Empire, as Muslims ruled Bengal for approximately five centuries, spanning from 1204 to 1757. The British East India Company (BEIC, hereafter) initiated the Bengal Government Opium Monopoly in 1763 and the land under poppy cultivation expanded to 303,500 hectares in 1767. BEIC officials such as Lord Clive plundered massive wealth and resources from Bengal, resulting in foods scarcity, poverty, hunger, malnutrition, and famines. For instance, a total of 10 million people died in the Bengal Famine of 1770. The Permanent Settlement of 1793 further introduced a quasi-feudal relationship between landlords and tenants. The Permanent Settlement broke the personal ties between the zamindars and the ryots or peasants. The Permanent Settlement, known as the Zamindari system, was a thus manifestation of the British divide and rule policy regarding Hindus and Muslims. The system widened the class and communal feuds between the few landed oligarchy and the many landless or underprivileged peasants. The BEIC took over the realm of state power in 1757 through the mysterious and treacherous defeat of Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey. Since then, the Muslims in the Subcontinent became systematically marginalized, impoverished and powerless. The upper caste Hindu Badralok were mostly privileged, educated and loyal to the British colonial regime. On the other hand, a large segment of the Muslim population were peasants, and they were largely under-privileged, illiterate, poor, and unorganized. The Muslim discontent against the alien domination was expressed in such as incidents as the Fakir-Sannyasi resistance in the time of Warren Hastings and the movements of Titu Mir and Haji Shariatullah’s Faraizi movement. These movements directly or indirectly affected the BEIC’s administration. After the 1857 revolt, the British colonial government had become aware that they had not been quite fair to Muslim interests. The irony was that the Muslims suffered from underrepresentation at the central and provincial legislatures. For instance, the Muslims constituted about 23% of the total population, but the percentage of the 'elected' Muslim members from 1893 to 1903 was only 12%. A similar anomaly existed also in the provinces: in Bengal the Muslims, for example, constituted nearly 52% of the population, but only 5.7% of the elected representatives were Muslims (Rashiduzzaman, 2019: 8). Perhaps it was the failure of the Muslims to get adequate representation in the Councils that caused frustration or distrust about the vast Hindu majority in India. On October 1, 1906, a Muslim deputation under the leadership of Aga Khan met the Viceroy and demanded a separate electorate for the Muslims and ultimately that was granted which raised a vehement criticism by the Hindu leaders of the Congress as well as the Hindu elite of the Indian civil society. The Muslims in Bengal were, thus, lagging behind Hindus in terms of education, employment, and empowerment. The Hindu-Muslim tensions increased throughout the 1920s and 1930s, which soared in the 1940s. W. W. Hunter also pointed out that the Muslims had suffered grave injustices particularly, in the areas of administrative and judicial jobs. The revolt of 1857 was one of the turning points in Syed Ahmed’s life. After the revolt, many protesters mostly the Muslims, were killed and persecuted by the British government. Sir Syed clearly understood the necessity for Muslims to become proficient in English and acquire modern scientific education to maintain their social, economic, and political powers in India. His academic and journalistic writings sparked an informed debate on the social, cultural, religious, and political dynamics between Muslims, Hindus, and the British. In her newly published memoir namely, Shadows at Noon: The South Asian Twentieth Century, noted historian Joya Chatterji observed that Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was the first to claim Indian Muslims as a separate nation (Chatterji, 2023: 47). Although not advocating partition, Sir Syed's political philosophy can be seen as laying the foundation for the Two-Nation Theory, which held that Muslims and Hindus were two separate nations with different cultures, religions, and interests. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the All-India Muslim League and the founding father of Pakistan, was also influenced by Sir Syed’s political philosophy. We can, therefore, argue that Sir Syed’s emphasis on the distinct identity and political interests of Muslims laid the groundwork for the development of the Two-Nation Theory, which Jinnah later championed to justify the demand for Pakistan. The Two-Nation Theory became the foundation of the 1940 Lahore Resolution, known commonly as the Pakistan Resolution, which was presented by the then Chief Minister of undivided Bengal, A. K. Fazlul Huq. Professor Ayesha Jalal noted that with the passage of time the Lahore Resolution emerged as a significant milestone in the political history of British India. (Jalal, 1985). Sir Syed maintained that Muslims should collaborate with the British government. He viewed the British as protectors of Muslim interests and encouraged Muslims to refrain from participating in the Indian National Congress, which he feared would align with Hindu interests at the expense of Muslim political representation. Sir Syed was devoted to the causes of liberal education in the subcontinent. In his 1858 monograph namely, The Causes of the Indian Revolt, Sir Syed identified five major reasons for the 1857 rebellion: the lack of Indian representation in legislative councils; forced religious conversions to Christianity; poor management of the Indian Army; British negligence of Muslim interests; and various other misguided policies that led to widespread dissatisfaction among different sections of society. He was too much impressed by Western rationalism and wanted to show that every doctrine of Islam could measure up to all principles of science, reason and common sense (Sayeed, 1960: 13). He believed that Islam is compatible with liberal values and religious tolerance. Sir Syed Ahmed established the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875. The foundation of the Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh served as tangible evidence that Sir Syed's ideas had been embraced by the Muslim community, as the institution was largely funded by their donations. The College was later transformed into the Aligarh Muslim University which became the main vehicle of Muslim education. Sir Syed urged the Muslims to remain loyal to the British government and not to take part in the nationalist movements spearheaded by the All-Indian National Congress, a political party formed in 1885. He felt that the Muslim community should remain aloof from all kinds of political agitation because by taking active part in the anti-colonial Mutiny of 1857, they had already placed themselves in danger by arousing British antagonism. So, the only path that lay before the Muslims, according to Sir Syed, was that of equipping themselves with English education. Sir Syed asserted that the well-being of every individual is of paramount importance. As he said, 'The government must provide all sort of rights related to property, employment, freedom of religion, speech, and life. It must protect them, and the unequal powers should not be allowed to harm anyone. The government must shield the weak and deserving from the undeserving mighty. Everyone should be allowed to get the full benefit from his property and skill' (Cited in Kidwai, 2021: 6). The impact of AM on the Bengali Muslims could hardly be underestimated. Sir Syed’s overall influence upon Bengal was part of his broader attempt to promote the upliftment of Muslims across India, although his direct involvement with Bengal was more limited compared to his impact in North India, particularly in Aligarh. Before this AM took place, fewer Bengali Muslims had received English education. It was the AM which introduced some Muslims with western education and science. It was a matter of pride to those Muslims who once could go to Aligarh to receive higher education in modern western lines. In the meantime, Lord Curzon executed the partition of Bengal in 1905. Dacca became the capital city of the newly created ‘Eastern Bengal and Assam’. The Partition of Bengal was a momentous phase in the development of Muslim nationalism in Bengal. The Muslim leaders became very optimistic after the partition scheme in 1905. As a result, in 1906, the Muslim leaders formed a new political party, namely All-India Muslim League to safeguard the political interests of the Muslim community in Bengal. As we have mentioned earlier, the Simla Deputation, led by Aga Khan, met with Governor General and Viceroy Lord Minto in Simla in October 1906. This deputation marked the first organized effort by the Muslim community to present their demands to the British government in India. Muslim leaders put forth two primary demands: first, the allocation of a fixed number of seats for Muslims in municipal and district boards, as well as in university governing bodies like the senate and syndicate. Second, they requested that Muslim representatives be elected separately to the Provincial Council, based on their political significance rather than their proportion of the population. Sir Syed’s ideas on the separate electorate were rooted in his broader vision for Muslim political representation and protection within the British colonial system. His idea of separate electorates for the Muslims can be viewed as evolving from some of his political beliefs and concerns for the Muslim community. In Bengal, institutions like the Islamia College followed Sir Syed's model of blending Western and Islamic education. Muslim intellectuals in Bengal, such as Nawab Abdul Latif and Syed Ameer Ali, advocated for educational reform among Muslims in line with Sir Syed’s liberal approach. The Hindu Bhodrolok feared a loss of economic and political power in Calcutta, and they accordingly began the anti-partition or Swadeshi movement led by Surendranath Banerji, Arabinda Ghosh, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai and so on. Out of the prevailing atmosphere of terrorism and fear, the British government annulled the partition scheme in 1911, resulting in Muslim discontent. The Muslim leaders including Nawbab Khaja Salimullah and Nawbab Ali Chowdhury could no longer remain satisfied with the British annulment of the partition of Bengal and the British government’s shrewd implementation of the divide and rule policy. It is to be noted that the separate electorate for the Muslim community was formally recognized in the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909. Moreover, Maulana Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, two prominent leaders of the Khilafat Movement in the early 20th century were both students at Aligarh Muslim University and were deeply influenced by Sir Syed’s ideas on Muslim education and political awareness. The Ali brothers took forward Sir Syed’s emphasis on the importance of Muslim unity, although they were involved in the anti-colonial struggle, unlike Sir Syed’s pro-British stance. The constitutional recognition of the separate electorate for the Muslims was a milestone in several important ways. First, the separate electorate facilitated the growth of a set of Muslim leaders like Sher-e-Bangla A. K. Fazlul Huq. The establishment of the University of Dacca in 1921 had also a big impact on the promotion of Muslim culture and political consciousness. Several societies and periodicals came into existence. The demand for education of the Muslims created an enabling environment for the Freedom of Intellect Movement (Buddhir Mukti Andolan), a Bengali Muslim-led renaissance advocating rationality against religious fanaticism and social dogma in Bengali Muslim society. It was spearheaded by several Dacca university intellectuals such as Kazi Abdul Wadud, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Abul Fazal, Muhammad Shahidullah, Qazi Motahar Hossain, Mothahar Hossen Chowdhury, and Abdul Quadir. Shikha was the mouthpiece of theMuslim Sahitya-Samajor Muslim literary society founded in Dhaka in 1926. In his 1926 speech, Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah said, 'The Hindu Shahitya is fed with Vedant, Gita, Hindu history and life. Hindu literature gathers flavors from Hindu society. It is through this literature that the Hindu and Muslims of Bengal will recognize each other. Cognition is the basis of love (Cited in Rahim, 2011: 219). The main slogan or motto of the Shikha was: 'Where knowledge is limited, intellect is inert, freedom is impossible'. Second, the separate electorate expanded the job opportunities and economic well-being of the Muslims. It eventually contributed to the political ascendency of A. K. Fazlul Huq who became the chief minister of undivided Bengal after the 1937 elections. Huq formed the Krishak Praja Party for the betterment of the peasants. He abolished the exploitative zamindari system. Once A. K. Fazlul Huq in the 1940s, called upon the people not to apologize for being Muslims (Rashiduzzaman, 2021). Huq’s call refers essentially to the perennial revivalism of Muslim identity and religious nationalism in Bengal. Third, the rise of the Muslim middle class was the cumulative outcome of the historical awakening and empowerment of the Muslims. The masses belonging to the rural and urban middle classes played key roles in the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. Thus, Syed Ahmed’s influence extended beyond his lifetime, with his ideas continuing to resonate during the struggle for independence. He inspired later political leaders, including those involved in the formation of the All-India Muslim League, a party established in 1906, following the partition of Bengal, which played a meaningful role in the demand for Pakistan. But the main domestic problem of separate electorates was overcome with Congress agreeing to Jinnah's plea to allow weightage of seats in the legislative councils of certain provinces where the Muslims were in the minority. This became known as the historic Lucknow Pact, and it made Jinnah a leader of the Indian Muslims. The atmosphere of Lucknow, where once again the All-India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress met to hold their annual sessions, was even more cordial. Jinnah was the main architect of the Lucknow Pact, and he was thereafter hailed as an ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. The Lucknow Pact acknowledged the provision of the separate electorate that was later incorporated into the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms of 1919. In this way, we came to learn that the separate electorate system was introduced by the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909, recognized by the Montagu-Chelmsford report of 1919 and further extended by the Government of India Act of 1935. All the elections to the local bodies and Legislative Council from 1909 to 1946 were held on the basis of the separate electorate system. It is here to be noted that the ideology of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was subject to criticism and limitation. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (1888–1958) was a scholar, freedom fighter, and proponent of Hindu-Muslim unity. A close reading of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad’s autobiography titled, India Wins Freedom reveals that Sir Syed Ahmed Khan had a decisive influence on Azad. Sir Syed’s emphasis on rationalism, scientific inquiry, and social reform significantly shaped Azad's worldview. Azad was inspired by Sir Syed's calls for a modern and progressive interpretation of Islam, advocating for reforms within Muslim society to align with contemporary realities. As Azad wrote, 'Suddenly a new way opened before me. I refer to the writings of Sir Sayyid [Syed Ahmed Khan]. Because this experience had a very great influence on my religious and intellectual life' (Cited in Douglas, 1988: 51). Although Azad recognized Sir Syed's contribution to Muslim education, he disagreed with many of his views. Maulana Azad believed that Sir Syed’s policy of loyalty to the British Empire was shortsighted and flawed as well. Azad argued that this stance diminished the role Muslims could play in the larger Indian freedom movement. He believed that Muslims, like Hindus, should oppose colonial rule, which was unjust and exploitative. To Azad, aligning too closely with the British harmed the political future of Indian Muslims. In conclusion, this paper reiterates its central thesis that as a visionary political leader and socio-religious reformer of the 19th century, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan played a vital role in empowering Muslims through the enlightening efforts of his Aligarh Movement. He recognized the importance of English education in empowering the Muslims and fostering fruitful interactions with the British ruling elite. While Sir Syed’s efforts to modernize Muslim education and social thought had a lasting impact, his critics argue that his loyalty to the British colonial government, his communal outlook, and his elitist approach to education contributed to a fractured Muslim identity. He was an early advocate of the separate electorate for the Muslim community. The demand of and recognition for the separate electorate in 1909 ignited a crucial debate during the anti-colonial nationalists as well as the Pakistan Movement leading to the emergence of two independent states namely, India and Pakistan in 1947. In a nutshell, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was a key figure in the awakening of the Muslim community in the subcontinent.

Why Libyan Oilfields Are Opening Now: Navigating The Central Bank...	The crisis in Libya began in August 2024, with ongoing efforts by various factions to gain control of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) posing a clear and present danger to the country. The crisis over the control of the CBL has resulted in the closure of 60% of Libya's oil production. This closure has halted some 700,000 barrels a day of production, with further shutdowns imminent, leading to an immediate spike of 7% in global oil prices. In response, Eastern factions declared a complete halt to oil production. Crude oil prices rose after the Eastern Libyan government announced the closure of all oil fields in August. This decision followed the crisis involving the Central Bank Governor and the subsequent suspension of production and exports. Oil prices increased by 3%, influenced by reports of 'almost complete' oil production in Libya. These reports heightened concerns that the escalation of the Middle East situation could disrupt the region's oil supplies. Millions of Libyans rely on the CBL to ensure the payment of their salaries and the letters of credit essential to providing them billions of dollars a year. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) is warning that the situation is critical. The Libyan government, led by Osama Hamad, also announced the suspension of oil production and exports from all fields in the country until further notice. However, the National Oil Corporation, which oversees oil resources and sector activities, did not confirm this. In a video statement posted on social media, Hamad explained that the decision was made 'in response to attacks on leaders and employees of the Central Bank of Libya by outlaw groups, incited and assisted by the Presidential Council.' The Government of National Unity in Tripoli, headed by Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, has not commented, nor has the National Oil Corporation, based in the capital, issued any statements. The resumption of Libyan crude oil production had previously led to a surplus of crude supplies in Europe, forcing competing sellers to cut their prices. This crisis caused the OPEC member's exports to fall to a four-year low. The National Oil Corporation (NOC) provides some 97% of Libya's export earnings, pumping roughly 1.2 million barrels a day of oil to generate $20 billion-25 billion. The resumption of Libyan crude oil production came after a political crisis over the central bank led to a surplus of crude supplies in Europe, forcing competing sellers to cut their prices, and the crisis caused the OPEC member's exports to fall to a four-year low. Libya's National Oil Corporation announced the resumption of production on October 3, 2024, after a new central bank governor was appointed. By October 13, production was at about 1.3 million barrels per day, close to pre-crisis levels. Data from a shipping agent showed that Libyan crude oil exports reached about 550,000 barrels per day in the first week of August, a three-fold increase from the previous week before the crisis, and this comes as Libya, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), remains amid a political crisis that has hampered oil production. The National Oil Corporation, which manages Libya's fossil fuel resources, has not declared force on all port loadings and has so far opted to use the measure on specific shipments. The corporation reported crude production at the El Feel oilfield on September 2 and exports from the Sharara field on August 7, before the crisis over the central bank's leadership erupted. The corporation confirmed on August 28 that oil production had fallen by more than half from normal levels to around 590,000 barrels per day, but did not provide any new production figures. The timing of Libya's increased oil production coincides with maintenance at European refineries and the full or partial closure of several refineries in the Mediterranean and northwestern Europe. This is weakening the prices of competing crudes. According to data from the London Stock Exchange (LSEG), the premium of Azerbaijan Light crude to benchmark Brent crude fell to $1.55 a barrel, its lowest since April. The spreads between other major Mediterranean crudes — Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) Blend, Saharan Blend, and Libya's Es Sider Blend — also narrowed in the first 11 days of October. These Mediterranean grades will face further downward pressure from the second-largest field supplying the CPC Blend, Kashagan, which returns from a full maintenance shutdown after November 10, 2024. Global oil prices surged to their highest levels abruptly due to the suspension of more than half of the country's oil production, equivalent to 700,000 barrels per day. This occurred after a dispute erupted between the eastern and western governments of the country over the central bank, the sole authority authorized to manage oil revenues. Libya incurred a loss of $120 million in just three days as oil exports remained suspended from major ports and production levels stayed low across the country, despite some increased supplies for local power generation. The Libyan National Oil Corporation announced the resumption of production on October 3 following the appointment of a new governor for the central bank. By October 13, production had reached approximately 1.3 million barrels per day, approaching pre-crisis levels. During a meeting with the Chairman of the Management Committee of the Libyan National Oil Corporation, Farhat Bengdara, the Prime Minister instructed support for the private oil sector to boost production and enhance the efficiency of Libyan workers. The state-owned National Oil Corporation aims to increase production to 2 million barrels per day, with the current daily output standing at 1,250,775 barrels. Oil and gas exports serve as Libya's primary source of income, but the sector has faced challenges in recent years due to internal conflicts and political instability. Libya's production has seen an increase due to maintenance work at European refineries, with several facilities in the Mediterranean and northwestern Europe either fully or partially closed. The crisis at the Libyan Central Bank commenced in late August, resulting in the shutdown of numerous oil fields and ports. Libyan crude oil exports dropped to approximately 550,000 barrels per day, marking their lowest level in four years and half the July average. However, October exports have since rebounded to over 600,000 barrels per day. Refineries have already made alternate arrangements to procure other crudes, anticipating a continued disruption in Libyan supplies. While European refineries will continue to receive Libyan shipments, they are in a position to negotiate significant discounts. Italy stands as the largest buyer of Libyan crude, accounting for a third of total Libyan exports in 2023.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeghCnAEweo2OHkcjPNb2VG	2024-10-22T09:41:18-07:00	
How Could The Ukraine-Russia War End? – OpEd	The outcome of the Ukraine-Russia war hinges on a complex mix of military strategy, diplomatic negotiations, and the endurance of each side's resources. Attrition warfare, where both nations aim to exhaust each other's manpower, supplies, and infrastructure, is likely to define the conflict's duration. The war's end will depend on how long both countries can sustain their efforts, both on the battlefield and economically. Military and Logistical Losses As the war continues, both sides will face increasing losses in personnel, equipment, and morale. The depletion of human resources and military hardware will strain both Russia and Ukraine. Use of Aircraft, Tanks, Artillery, Drones, and Ammunition: Modern warfare relies heavily on technology. Both sides are deploying drones, artillery, tanks, and air forces. How effectively these technologies are used, along with their losses, will heavily impact the war's trajectory. Weapons Aid to Ukraine Western military aid to Ukraine remains a critical factor in its resistance. Continued supply of advanced weaponry could strengthen Ukraine's position. However, any disruption in these supplies could significantly weaken Ukraine's military capacity. Agreement on Territorial Gains or Losses The resolution of the war will likely require a territorial compromise. Long and difficult negotiations may focus on Russian-controlled areas and Ukraine's efforts to reclaim them. A settlement will depend on both sides agreeing to borders or a new status quo that satisfies, or at least appeases, each party. Impact on Neighboring Countries Economic and Political Consequences: The war has already caused a European energy crisis, refugee flows, and heightened security concerns. Increased energy costs, disruptions in global supply chains, and geopolitical tensions are making the war's spillover effects on neighboring countries, especially in Europe, more severe. Military Strategies and Security Measures: NATO's eastern members have significantly increased their military spending, reinforcing their defense postures. Neighboring countries are also on high alert, taking preventive measures to contain the risk of the war spilling over into their own territories. Possible Outcomes Military Stalemate and Prolonged Attrition: The conflict could drag on as a war of attrition, where both sides continue to wear down each other's military and economic capacity. This scenario may lead to a prolonged stalemate with no clear victor. Diplomatic Negotiations: A negotiated settlement remains a possible outcome, potentially mediated by international actors. Such a resolution would require compromises on territorial claims and could involve significant concessions from both sides. Ukrainian Military Victory: Wsustained Western support, Ukraine could potentially regain significant territory. However, this outcome would require continued international aid, strong military performance, and a weakening of Russia's war capabilities. Russian Military Victory or Ceasefire: Russia may consolidate control over occupied territories and claim a tactical victory. This could lead to a frozen conflict, similar to other unresolved disputes involving Russia, where hostilities stop but underlying tensions remain. External Pressure and Sanctions: Continued international sanctions and diplomatic isolation could push Russia toward negotiations. If Russia's internal economic or social stability deteriorates significantly, it may be forced to seek an end to the conflict. Impact on Neighboring Countries: The war's outcome will reshape European security, especially for NATO members. Military expenditures have already increased, particularly in Eastern Europe, and the region's security architecture will likely be redefined in response to the war's conclusion. Turkey's Position Turkey's neutral stance between Russia and Ukraine allows it to maintain diplomatic flexibility. This could position Turkey as a key mediator in future peace talks or post-conflict resolutions. By remaining neutral, Turkey preserves its strategic options and influence in the region. The Ukraine-Russia war is likely to end through either a decisive military outcome or a negotiated compromise. A complete military victory for one side seems less likely in the short term, making a diplomatic solution or a frozen conflict more plausible.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeghCnAEweo2AaIfTt6XUj0	2024-10-22T09:38:40-07:00	
Cyber Warfare And Emerging Technologies: Securing Pakistan’s Futu...	As technology continues to evolve, future wars will likely be fought not by humans alone but with machines playing a central role. However, human control may still influence the operations of these machines, especially in cyber warfare. Today, states have a variety of methods to attack each other that go beyond conventional warfare. These include cyber operations alongside military, economic, or political strategies. With emerging innovations and recent technological advancements, cyberspace has become a new domain of warfare, presenting complex threats. From a national security perspective, cyber warfare—the use of information technology to infiltrate a country's classified databases or strike its essential systems—is one of the most menacing forms of conflict. The frequency and intensity of cyber warfare are increasing, fueled by the advancement of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC). These technologies not only amplify the number of cyber threats but also increase their sophistication. To secure its place as a dominant force in cyberspace, Pakistan must begin mastering these cyber realms today. By positioning itself as a hub of AI and QC, Pakistan can make a significant global impact. Cyber Warfare Cyber warfare refers to computer and network operations intended to control or disrupt vital ICT resources in a state or government, aiming to cause harm or espionage. In many countries, the dependency on technology has made cyber threats more frequent. A historic example is the Morris Worm, the first major hacker attack that affected up to six thousand computers, causing losses ranging from one hundred thousand to millions of dollars. It targeted Unix operating systems, deleting files and slowing down operations. Another significant incident was the Stuxnet Worm, used by the United States against Iran’s nuclear program. Stuxnet not only destroyed nearly 1,000 uranium enrichment centrifuges, delaying Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but it also infected Windows computers and networks, spreading rapidly through a USB drive. AI and Quantum Computing in Warfare AI and QC are shaping the future of technology and warfare. AI, which processes vast amounts of data and runs algorithms to identify patterns, is highly advanced and adaptable. However, its potential use in weapon technology raises serious concerns. QC, with its unparalleled computational power, can perform calculations simultaneously by leveraging quantum mechanics. Both AI and QC pose serious threats to national security because of their autonomous capabilities and the difficulty of preventing them from being exploited. AI systems, which can simulate human intelligence, are revolutionizing problem-solving and innovation but are also susceptible to cyberattacks. Data breaches in centralized servers, which house sensitive information, can expose AI systems to these attacks, allowing hackers to target critical infrastructure like power grids or classified databases. In military operations, the integration of AI—especially in autonomous weapon systems—could surpass conventional forces in terms of both damage and risk. However, for a country like Pakistan, AI has the potential to strengthen cyber defenses and augment intelligence capabilities, providing a vital edge in defense strategies. Properly managed, AI could defend against emerging cyber threats while significantly improving data analysis and cybersecurity efforts. Pakistan’s Cybersecurity Landscape Despite Pakistan’s growing reliance on digital technologies, the population remains vulnerable to online threats due to low cybersecurity literacy. Phishing, identity fraud, and other cybercrimes continue to pose serious risks to everyday users who lack the tools to protect themselves. This calls for increased government involvement, as well as the role of corporations in promoting cybersecurity education. On a larger scale, external threats, particularly from India, have intensified. India has simultaneously enhanced its cyber warfare capabilities, often compromising Pakistan's government and military networks. This emphasizes the urgent need for Pakistan to bolster its national cyber defenses. To address the rising threats in cyberspace, the Pakistani government must improve its national cybersecurity infrastructure and develop robust cyber defense mechanisms. Strengthening institutions such as the national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) will be critical in preventing or mitigating attacks on critical infrastructure. However, Pakistan faces a shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals, which necessitates cooperation with countries like China and Turkey, both of which are more advanced in this field. Collaboration on threat intelligence sharing and joint cybersecurity exercises can help Pakistan manage vulnerabilities and fortify its defenses. AI, QC, and the Future of Pakistan’s Cybersecurity As AI and QC continue to influence the future of cybersecurity, Pakistan must invest in research and development in these fields. AI, in particular, can play a crucial role in combating anticipated cyber threats. Pakistan must also focus on improving cybersecurity literacy and infrastructure to safeguard against both domestic and external threats. This involves not only governmental efforts but also corporate responsibility and public awareness initiatives. Moreover, the continued rise of external threats, such as cyber operations by India, underscores the need for strong national cybersecurity policies and international cooperation. Pakistan’s future in cyberspace depends on its ability to adapt to and master these emerging technologies. With a solid investment in AI research and the development of comprehensive cybersecurity strategies, Pakistan can defend itself against future cyber threats while enhancing its intelligence capabilities and securing its position as a global player in the realm of cyber warfare.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeghCnAEweo2JLVSL1FOAHP	2024-10-22T09:36:54-07:00	
The Importance Of A Rohingya Crisis Solution Between Myanmar And ...	The Rohingyas of Myanmar have been forced to leave their homes and become refugees for years to save their lives due to the incitement and ethnic genocide committed by Myanmar's military junta. In August, 2017, at least0.7 million Rohingyastook refuge in Bangladesh to save their lives in the face of the most brutal ethnic attacks in recent memory. They had fled to Bangladesh in the face of the same incident earlier. As a result, the number of Rohingyas who have taken refuge in the coastal areas of Bangladesh is now about1.2 million. Bangladesh is forced to shelter them due to humanitarian reasons. However, the world's superpowers, including the United Nations, could not play an effective role in finding a real solution to the problems of this helpless population. Rather, the socio-economic situation of these people has become more miserable due to the complicated geopolitical situation. India and China have not played an active role in their own interests. On the other hand, Western powers including the United States of America and the United Nations have offered financial aid and talked about the problem, but have not been able to solve it. The present growing turmoil in Myanmar is probably what made Bangladesh feel the need to act quickly: In recent months,some 20,000 Rohingyarefugees have crossed the border into Bangladesh. Bangladesh has for a time received a large amount of aid for the Rohingya from various donor groups including human rights organizations but this has dwindled over time. Crises elsewhere in the world, including the war in Ukraine and Israel's attack on Gaza, have diverted international attention from the Rohingya. Bangladesh has long been burdened by a large number of Rohingya, which poses a threat to the country's natural environment as well as creating social and internal political crises. On the other hand, the human rights of people trapped in shelters are limited. They spend years in uncertainty as to when they will be able to return to their homeland, or if they will never be able to. On the other hand, the previous Sheikh Hasina government of Bangladeshwas a dictatorship. Along with the administration, police, etc., foreign powers were the means of survival of that government. As a result, the previous Hasina government was diplomatically weak and less accepted by the intentional community. And so, Bangladesh could not raise the issue of Rohingya in the world. But that government fell because Sheikh Hasina ran away in a mass movement on August 05. Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus became the head of the country's interim government. Apart from solving all other problems of the country, the Rohingya problem is also on his shoulders. Hopefully, Dr. Yunus is perhaps the most qualified person for this job, because there are no other Bangladeshis with international contacts and influence like him at the moment. An important first step in resolving the problem is for Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Yunus, who has significant international ties, to push for more humanitarian help for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and a sustainable solution of Rohingya repatriation from Bangladesh to Myanmar. Fueling that hope,he recently called for the United Nations to establish safe zones for displaced people in Rakhine, Myanmar, and find ways to help them. He said this could be a good start in solving the ongoing crisis in Rakhine and prevent thousands of new refugees from entering Bangladesh. He said these things when UN special rapporteur Thomas Andrews came to meet him at the office of the chief adviser on the human rights situation in Myanmar. Repatriation of Rohingyas to their own country is the only solution, but the repatriation process is stuck in various complications. Multifaceted diplomatic efforts are essential to resolve the Rohingya crisis. Influential countries must take effective initiatives to end the war and restore stability in Myanmar and Rakhine State. In a joint press conference with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim who recently visited Bangladesh, the chief advisor Dr. Muhammad Yunus termed the long unresolved Rohingya crisis as a fresh time bomb and warned the international community that it could explode at any time. He said that the solution to this problem is not in the hands of Bangladesh, but in the hands of the international community. We cannot wait indefinitely. This is something we need to address as soon as possible. Earlier last month, Special Rapporteur Thomas Andrews met with the Chief Adviser on the Rohingya crisis on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York. At this time, he praisedthe three-point proposalpresented by the Chief Adviser to the United Nations to solve the Rohingya crisis. Professor Yunus advised to stop the violence in Rakhine and discuss with the international community including ASEAN for displaced people. He also sought the help of the Special Rapporteur to expedite the resettlement of thousands of Rohingya refugees in third countries. 'First of all,we want the UN Secretary General to organize a conference on the Rohingya crisis in the presence of all parties involved as soon as possible,' he stated. Dr. Yunus reviewed the Rohingya crisis's overall state and stated that a fresh, long-term solution should be suggested to end it. Second, he stated that the 'Joint Response Plan' initiative, which was carried out in collaboration between Bangladesh and the United Nations, has to be revived. According to Yunus, political choices should be made to boost the process of gathering money because there is a dearth of finances to spend on Rohingyas. 'The international community should come forward with sincere support to ensure justice for the crimes of genocide committed against Rohingyas,' he stated in the third suggestion. Hopefully, the Bangladesh government and the United Nations, along with other world powers, can resolve the Rohingya issue immediately. If the Chief Adviser takes effective initiatives in this regard, it is hoped that this serious humanitarian problem will be solved. All of us must be vigilant so that this problem does not lose its importance in the ongoing unstable and conflict situation around the world. The role of major countries in addressing this challenge and facilitating repatriation is crucial. Yunus maintains that the international world has to unite in favor of Bangladesh's stance that it cannot take in any more Rohingyas. Increasing humanitarian supplies, supporting community development initiatives, and applying pressure on Myanmar to expedite repatriation operations are all examples of this support. Bangladesh is prepared to collaborate with the international community in order to provide the circumstances required for the Rohingya to return in a dignified and sustainable manner.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeghCnAEweo2ArvknBy7JQJ	2024-10-22T09:34:43-07:00	
China’s Nuclear Submarine Bases: A Stocktaking – Analysis	By Rear Admiral Monty Khanna (Retired) China’s nuclear submarine building programme is running on overdrive.[1] If China maintains its current pace of construction of 4.5 to six nuclear submarines per year for the next couple of decades, the number of nuclear boats in the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) inventory is set to swell substantially. Nuclear submarines are amongst the most complex and maintenance-heavy platforms ever made globally. They require capable bases with robust repair and maintenance facilities to ensure that they are combat-capable throughout their commissioned lives. While existing Chinese bases have evolved and grown over the years, they will fall short in their ability to home-port this rapidly expanding fleet unless augmented substantially. This report examines existing Chinese nuclear submarine bases and makes a prognosis on how the capacity shortfall is likely to be mitigated in the coming years. Existing Chinese Nuclear Submarine Bases a. First Submarine Base –Jianggezhuang(Northern Theatre Navy) Location. This base is located 18 km East North East of Qingdao (36o06.5’ N, 120o35.1’ E) in a wide bay (1.9 km x 1.1 km), the mouth of which has been partially constricted by the construction of breakwaters at either end (Fig 1). Given that the facility is located in the Yellow Sea with easy access only to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan—both of which impose constraints on operations either due to shallow depths or transit through restrictive straits—it was not the ideal location for basing nuclear submarines. However, this has to be seen in context of the time it was built, when the primary adversary of China was the erstwhile Soviet Union. Given the limited range of the JL-1 strategic missile that was carried by the sole PLAN Xia-Class (Type 09-II) SSBN, it made sense to build a base towards the north, putting at least a few major population centres in the Soviet Union within missile range. Further proximity to Beijing (from a Command-and-Control perspective) as well as to Qingdao—the location of the submarine training school and home to China’s first conventional submarine base—would have also been considerations for siting this base. Figure 1: General Location ofFirst Submarine Base –Jianggezhuang(Northern Theatre Navy) Source: Google Earth (All images in this article are from Google Earth Pro. Analysis pertaining to size and area has been done using tools available in Google Earth Pro.) Early Construction.Construction at Jianggezhuang started in 1968, the same year in which construction of the first Han-Class (Type 09-I) submarine commenced at the Bohai Shipyard in Huludao.[2]During the late 1960s and early ‘70s, PLAN spared no effort in the construction of the base. Several engineering regiments were relocated to this site to speed up work on the project which included berthing and drydock arrangements, and the excavation of a tunnel complex designed to protect submarines located inside it against a conventional/nuclear attack (Fig 2). As there are no exposed facilities for missile loading on SSBNs, it may be presumed that one or more of the underground shelters of this complex includes caverns high enough to permit the installation of large cranes to load or disembark ballistic missiles. Reportedly, there are also facilities to attend to the upkeep of nuclear reactors and associated equipment.[3]By the mid-‘70s, the base was ready to receive the first nuclear boat, the Han-Class submarine No. 401. Figure 2: Layout of Facilities -Jianggezhuang Source: Google Earth, 19 April 2004 Underground Complex. The entrance to the underground complex is 13.5-m-wide and is flanked on either side by concrete shoulders[a] which could be used for temporary berthing while submarines are entering/exiting. The visible concrete face of the complex has a camouflage paint scheme. The shoulders were widened in 2010, thereby increasing the usable space (Fig 3). Figure 3: Entrance to Tunnel Complex–Jianggezhuang Source: Google Earth Dry Dock. The base houses maintenance facilities including a dry dock (170 m x 21 m), large enough to accommodate a Jin-Class submarine (Fig 4). There is a crane on the south-eastern side of the dock though the absence of a heavier gantry crane is indicative of its limited role in repairs and refits. An analysis of Google imagery indicates extensive use of the dry dock till 2014, after which it began to taper. The last image of a submarine occupying the dock on Google Earth Pro is from December 2017. This decline in dock occupancy could be reflective of the fewer number of boats operating from the base consequent to the enhancement of facilities at Longpo. It is possible that the dock is currently only used for emergent requirements, with most of the scheduled maintenance being undertaken at Bohai which entails a passage of about 475 nautical miles.[b] Figure 4: DryDock–Jianggezhuang Source: Google Earth, 11 November 2016 Wharfage.There are three widely dispersed floating jetties, each 90-m-long (one of which is appended to the western breakwater). There are also two masonry jetties, one abutting each breakwater at the entrance. The one on the western breakwater is 70-m-long and that on the eastern breakwater is 100 m. Between 2005 and 2007, a 180-m-long masonry jetty along with a wide hard was added between the tunnel complex and dry dock (Fig 5). This is long enough to accommodate two submarines which are usually berthed bow to bow with the sterns extending beyond the jetty so as to preclude any possibility of their stabilisers making contact with it. Imagery also reveals that the use of floating jetties to berth nuclear submarines has declined over the years. Some have been removed and the remaining are primarily being utilised by tugs and other auxiliaries. Figure 5: New Masonry Wharf–Jianggezhuang Source: Google Earth, 23 October 2019 Assets.The base comes under the Northern Theatre Navy. It is currently home to the three remaining Type 09I Han Class (possibly decommissioned or placed in reserve), two to three of the more modern Type 09III A/B Shang Class and the sole Type 09II Xia Class (possibly decommissioned). b. Second Submarine Base - Longpo (Southern Theatre Navy) Location.The base is located in the southern end of the island of Hainan (18o12.6’ N, 109o41.3’ E), 18 km east of Sanya (Fig 6). The location of the base was driven by a requirement to ensure that the encumbrances associated with Jianggezhuang, particularly insofar as SSBN operations were concerned, were addressed. Longpo, with its easy access to the expanse and deep waters of the SCS, does so. Figure 6: General Location ofSecond Submarine Base – Longpo (Southern Theatre Navy) Source: Google Earth Facilities. Work at this location began in the early 2000s with the construction of several breakwaters to create a large sheltered basin surrounding the berthing area (Fig 7). There are two entrances to the basin, one to the South (300 m wide) and the other to the West (320 m wide). There is also an opening to the North West though this has not been observed to be used by PLAN assets. Once the breakwaters were complete, work shifted to the construction of jetties as well as the tunnel complex. Figure 7: Layout of Facilities -Longpo Source: Google Earth, 10 October 2023 Wharfage. In the first phase (which went on till 2005), three parallel masonry wharfs to berth submarines were completed. Each of these is 230-m-long (usable length of 173 m) and 20-m-wide. There are large covered conduits that run along either edge of the jetty in which all services (power supply, fresh water, demineralised water, and chilled water, among others) are housed, thereby giving the jetties an uncluttered appearance. A fourth wharf (towards the South) was built in 2009 and two more (one to the North and the other to the South) were added in 2022-23, thereby resulting in a total six wharfs capable of berthing 12 nuclear submarines (Fig 8).[c] Figure 8: Submarine Piers -Longpo Source: Google Earth Underground Cavern. Work on the underground cavern commenced in 2005 soon after the completion of the breakwaters. Its entrance is 17-m-wide, considerably wider than the 13.5-m entrance at Jianggezhuang.[d] It, too, is flanked by wide concrete shoulders to assist in the entry and egress of submarines (Fig 9). The entrance aperture has a camouflaged cover, possibly to isolate the interior from any damage from a blast occurring outside. The interior of the complex is likely to be designed on the lines of that at Jianggezhuang, i.e., with enormous spaces to accommodate cranes for the loading and unloading of the even larger JL-2 and soon to be inducted JL-3 SLBMs. There are also smaller tunnel openings seen at the northern end of the base which are possibly for transporting missiles to/from the loading cavern. A point of differentiation could, however, be that as Longpo did not have a visible functional dry dock capable of accommodating a vessel as large as a nuclear submarine till 2022, it is highly likely that this complex even includes an underground dry dock. The ability to dock a submarine in the event of an emergent requirement is essential for any base and it would be hard to imagine the PLAN not having such capability for several years in their largest nuclear submarine base. From an engineering standpoint, creating such a facility may not be as difficult as it initially appears as the quantum of excavation will not be far removed from that required to create another underground berth. Figure 9: Entrance to Tunnel Complex -Longpo Source: Google Earth, 13 December 2019 Degaussing Facility.There is a degaussing facility 250-m-long and 30-m-wide next to the southern end of the tidal basin (Fig 10). This is used by both ships and submarines. Figure 10: Degaussing Complex -Longpo Source: Google Earth, 06 February 2022 Allied Infrastructure.Over the years, a large number of buildings to facilitate command, control, administration, and accommodation have been constructed along with extensive sporting facilities. There is a coastal missile battery located on the hill to the east overlooking the basin. Assets.The base comes under the Southern Theatre Navy. It is currently home to all the six (or seven, as China is opaque in terms of numbers) Jin-Class submarines. Several Shang-Class are also based here. Submarine Trial Base – Xiaopingdao The submarine trial base, Xiaopingdao (38o 49.1’ N, 121o 29.5’ E) is located in the exceptionally shallow and constrained Gulf of Bohai (Fig 11). It is used for undertaking the trials and testing of new nuclear and conventional submarines.[4] As it does not have an operational role and is unlikely to acquire one in future, the berthing facilities contained in it are not being considered for this analysis. Figure 11: Submarine Trial Base – Xiaopingdao Source: Google Earth, 06 Mar 2022 Table 1 gives a summary of the PLAN’s nuclear submarine bases, assets, and berthing facilities.

The options available to the PLAN to address the shortfall are either to augment the capacity at one or both of the existing bases or to build a greenfield base at a suitable location. These options are analysed in the succeeding paragraphs. Expansion ofJianggezhuang.Given the enormous size of the enclosed bay, there is ample scope to increase the capacity of the base by building more piers. The disadvantage of geographical location, however, remains a defining factor. Nuclear submarines, both SSBNs and SSNs, require large expanses of deep waters to be exploited to their full capacity. The Yellow Sea and the East China Sea are constrained on both counts. Exits from these seas require transiting through narrow straits that will be intensely monitored. Given its proximity to the submarine schools in Qingdao, the base is well located to serve as a nuclear submarine training facility. As the fleet strength of these boats increase, so will the training load; for this purpose, one may see some improvements to the berthing infrastructure. In the absence of an enhanced operational role, however, such changes are likely to be minor. Augmentation of Longpo.Berthing at Longpo has been enhanced by the construction of two additional jetties. If further expansion was envisaged, it would have been undertaken as part of the last phase to save on mobilisation costs. Further, with 12 existing berths (in addition to a few more in the tunnel complex), expansion will create a single point of vulnerability, which the PLAN may like to avoid. Creation of a Green-Field Nuclear Submarine Base.This appears to be the most likely option as it would best address the looming shortfall. Such a facility could be located on the shores of the South China Sea, either at a new location in Hainan or on the southern coastline of the mainland. While this may be an expensive option, costs could be contained by dispensing with the requirement of a tunnel complex. Protection in harbour was essentially required at a time when such assets were few in number and therefore extremely valuable. If the number of SSBNs are inadequate to maintain a Continuous At Sea Deterrence (CASD) posture, protection of one’s second strike capability in harbour becomes vital. As the fleet strength increases to maintain one or more boats continuously at sea, this requirement diminishes. In this respect, it may be seen that neither of the two US submarine SSBN bases at Kings Bay, Georgia and Bremerton, Washington have tunnel complexes for submarines. Given China’s record of building robust shore-based infrastructure prior to the induction of assets, it is quite possible that construction of a greenfield base has already commenced. Specialised Role for Domestic Bases.China’s first nuclear submarine base at Jianggezhuang home ported the Type 09-I Han-Class SSNs as well as the lone Type 09-II Xia-Class SSBN. With time, these assets were augmented by the Type 09-III Shang-Class SSNs as well as the Type 09-IV Jin-Class SSBNs. Once the second base at Hainan was completed, the entire fleet of Jin-Class SSBNs along with a few Shang-Class SSNs were rebased at this location. The combined basing of SSBNs and SSNs comes with its own set of challenges. If China builds a new nuclear submarine base as mentioned earlier, it may opt for specialised bases for SSNs and SSBNs, a practice followed by the United States Navy. Given that weapon loading facilities for SSBNs have been built at considerable expense inside the tunnel complex at Longpo, the logical thing to do would be to retain all SSBNs at this location and relocate the SSNs to the new harbour. The base architecture that could emerge over time is summarised in Table 2. Table 2: The Likely Future Base Architecture BaseLocationAssetsFunctions1stBaseJianggezhuangLimited number of 09-IIIA/BNuclear submarine trainingAlternative base for SSBNs2ndBaseLongpo09-IV, 09-VIOperational base for SSBNsAlternative base for SSNs3rdBaseNew Location09-IIIA/B, 09-VOperational base for SSNs Overseas Bases For sustained operations beyond the Pacific, either in the Indian, Atlantic, or Arctic Oceans, access to overseas bases will be an inescapable requirement. This is particularly true for China which is not endowed with either a conducive maritime or a geopolitical geography to support submarine operations from the mainland. Its coastline is ringfenced by two chains of islands, control of which lies largely with countries whose security interests are not aligned to its own. Passage through these island chains is through relatively narrow straits, which as mentioned earlier, are likely to be intensely surveilled, particularly in times of heightened tension. Insofar as SSN operations are concerned, it will therefore be of paramount importance for the PLAN to have the ability to deploy assets beyond the second island chain on a near permanent basis. This can only be done if it has access to robust overseas bases where political arrangements are strong enough to cater for usage during periods of geo-political tension and even conflict. Such bases are yet to emerge, but given China’s intense engagement with the Global South, it is only a matter of time before they become a reality. The possible locations of such facilities have been speculated upon at length. Needless to say, countries in the South West Indian Ocean, South Pacific as well as in the Gulf of Guinea figure in such assessments.

Japan’s Enduring Defence Pivot Under Kishida – Analysis	By Ayumi Teraoka Japan is a ‘small-c’ conservative country. Japanese politics and society are usually slow to change in response to global trends. This is not always a bad thing — Japan hasseemingly escapedthe steep political polarisation and the rise of the far right vexingdemocracies elsewhere. Often underappreciated, however, is that once Japan changes in response to the external environment, the shift tends to stick for the same reason, with little likelihood of reverting. The last three years of formerprime minister Fumio Kishida’s administrationunderscored a durable shift in Japan’s strategic posture. Kishida doubled down on the national security and foreign policy direction of his predecessors, especially the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe. Sometimes called the ‘Abe Doctrine’, Japan’s new strategy primarily consists of three tenets — strengthening ties with the United States and other likeminded partners, loosening restrictions on the use of military power as a means of statecraft and proactively defending the rules-based international order. With China on its doorstep, Japan no longer hides in the shadow of the US–Japan alliance and engages actively in regional and global security, marking a departure from Japan’spost-World War II strategy. That Kishida accelerated these efforts should come as no surprise. He led Japan amid wars in Ukraine and Gaza, growing ties between Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang andheightened tensionsin the Taiwan Strait. Domestically, Kishida won the prime ministership in October 2021 by gaining support from the still-politically powerful Abe, who wasconvincedKishida would continue his agenda. Having served as Abe’s foreign minister from 2012 to 2017, Kishida was also personallyinvestedin foreign policy. In continuing to implement Japan’s new strategy, Kishidatook advantageof his liberal image as a politician, which likely tamed public backlash, as well as leadership changes in partner countries. Through his ‘shuttle diplomacy’ with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, Kishida improved Japan’s relationship with South Korea. Their bilateral intelligence-sharing agreementwas normalisedandexport controls to South Koreawere eased. These US allies also began newbilateralandtrilateralcooperation in quantum technology, artificial intelligence and economic security. Building off of Abe’sstable and positive tieswith former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, the advent of much more pro-US leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr in Manila also allowed the Kishida government to upgrade Japan–Philippine ties. Japanprovidedcoastal surveillance radars for the Philippine Navy as part of Japan’s newOfficial Security Assistanceprogram and signed Japan’s thirdreciprocal access agreementto enable better logistical coordination between the two forces. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine allowed Kishida to adjust his predecessor’s Russia policy. Abe’s repeated attempts to steer Russian President Vladimir Putin away from China had gone nowhere. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the emergence of the ‘no-limits’ Sino–Russian friendship underscored Tokyo’s limited leverage over Moscow. Unlike Abe, who wavered after Russia’s takeover of Crimea in 2014, Kishida promptly joined the multilateral sanctions regime, deepening Japan’s partnership with NATO. His regularattendanceat NATO summits andinvitationof Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the G7 Summit in Hiroshima in May 2023 were the most visible efforts. In December 2023, Kishida’s administration also eased theban on weapons exportsto help replenish US Patriot missiles to support Ukraine. Domestically, Kishida also advanced major agendas on security in ways his predecessors could not. In May 2022, he passed the far-reaching Economic Security Promotion Act to navigate the new era of US–China competition. In December 2022, he announced Japan’s plan to acquire stand-off strike capabilities and drastically increase its defence-related budget to 2 per cent of GDP. Starting in 2025,Japan will also acquire400 Tomahawk cruise missiles, allowing the Japan Self-Defense Forces to hit enemies from further afield. This is a remarkable shift in the US–Japan alliance, where Japan traditionally focused on being the ‘shield’ while relying on the US military’s ‘spear’. This decision has promptedofficial dialoguesabout modernising and upgrading coordination between the two forces’ command and control systems. Underpinning these strategic investments is both Japanese policymakers’ desire to strengthen deterrence against Beijing and a shift in Japan’s public discourse. International security experts and former defence planners now regularly appear on popular television shows to explain military operations. A slew ofintroductorybooksonmilitary affairsare displayed prominently at bookstores in Tokyo. Having confronted Chinese maritime expansionsince 2008, the public overwhelminglyconsidersChina a threat, and also supports upgrading the US–Japan alliance and increasing Japan’s defence budget. Kishida’s leadershipbegan to falter following Abe’s assassinationin July 2022. Having lost Abe’s backing and lacking a strong personal political base, Kishida could not respond effectively to revelations ofpoliticalandfinancialscandals. Kishida appeared unfit to reform the party, and over time lost public approval and political capital. Notably, despite these domestic headwinds, the sticky change in Japan’s strategic posture continued to allow Kishida to advance Japan’s lingering defence ‘homework’ with little public backlash. His administration passed legislation to establisha broader security clearance systemin May 2024 andprepared legislationto allow for pre-emptive measures against cyberattacks. Even in his final weeks, Kishidamade another historic decisionto let a Japanese destroyer pass through the Taiwan Strait. To navigate intensifying geopolitical challenges,Japan’s new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, must establish a stronger domestic footing in advancing reforms. Kishida initially had this domestic stability with the backing of Abe. Ishiba must find another way to consolidate his power, especially after failing toappointhis political rivals to his cabinet. Turning to the public to gain overwhelming public support is one way — and all the more reason to pay close attention to theupcoming House of Representatives electionon 27 October — but so far, Ishiba is facing a pretty rough road ahead.

Will Arab Americans Have The Final Say In US Presidential Electio...	By Tarek Ali Ahmad As the US presidential election approaches, one thing is clear: Arab Americans are more engaged with the political process and more determined to have their say than ever before. According to an Arab News/YouGov survey conducted between Sept. 26 and Oct. 1, no fewer than nine out of 10 Arab Americans plan to vote on Nov. 5. This is a significant increase in political participation compared to previous elections: Some 79 percent voted in 2020 and only 68 percent in 2016. After a year of war and suffering in Gaza and amid escalating conflict across the Middle East, this new-found determination to influence US policy cannot be separated from the harsh realities of today’s world. It is clear from the survey that Arab Americans feel that their voices must be heard now more than ever, both for shaping the future of the US and in influencing its foreign policy toward their ancestral homelands. What stands out in this survey is not just the sheer number of Arab Americans intending to vote, but also how this engagement reflects the evolution of the community itself. We see a group of people deeply affected by the world around them, particularly by the issues that hit closest to home — both in the US and abroad. The survey shows that men are particularly motivated, with 92 percent planning to vote, compared with 81 percent of women. There is also a clear generational divide: Older Arab Americans, those over 55, are more determined to vote (90 percent) than younger voters aged 18-34 (84 percent). This sense of urgency among older voters might be driven by their lived experience. They have watched US foreign policy unfold in ways that have profoundly impacted their families and communities in the Middle East. The younger generation, on the other hand, seems to have its eyes set both on domestic issues, such as the economy, and the broader implications of US actions abroad. There is also a geographical divide. Arab Americans in the northeast seem particularly engaged, with 90 percent believing their vote matters. This makes sense in a region where political activism has historically been strong among immigrants and minority communities, and where the Arab American community has made significant strides in integrating into the political fabric. However, while Arab Americans are more politically engaged than ever, they are also deeply divided. According to the survey, 45 percent plan to vote for Donald Trump, while 43 percent back Kamala Harris. Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who many thought would resonate with the community’s progressive values, is barely registering at 4 percent. These numbers reveal the complexities within the Arab American vote, a community that cannot be pigeonholed into one political ideology. Interestingly, more Arab American men (48 percent) back Trump than women (41 percent), while older voters lean toward Harris, with 49 percent of those over 55 supporting her. This generational split is striking. While older voters might see Harris as a continuation of policies that, at the very least, align with their hopes for a more diplomatic US approach to the Middle East, Trump’s appeal among men, particularly younger ones, shows a different, more hard-nosed perspective on both domestic and foreign policy. Again, regional differences are clear. Trump’s strongest support comes from the northeast (48 percent), while Stein’s greatest, though still limited, backing is primarily from the midwest. These regional and gender divides show that Arab Americans, like the broader US electorate, are torn between competing visions for the future. Of course, one issue weighs most heavily on the minds of many Arab Americans: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which emerges as the No. 1 concern for the community, including domestic worries about the US economy, and disappointment with the way the Biden administration has handled it. More believe Trump is more likely to resolve the conflict than Harris, even though the former president is seen as considerably more supportive of Israel’s government. On the other hand, Arab Americans are split 50-50 over which of the two main candidates would be better for the Middle East generally. On this question men and residents of the northeast lean toward Trump, while older voters have more faith in Harris. But the truth is neither candidate is particularly trusted when it comes to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and many Arab Americans remain pessimistic about the possibility of a genuine solution, no matter who wins the presidency. Trump’s vocal support for the Israeli government has not gone unnoticed: 69 percent of Arab Americans consider him a staunch ally of Israel, compared to 59 percent who believe the same about Harris. It is also interesting how little Arab Americans seem to know about Stein’s position on the conflict, despite her frequent criticism of the Israeli government’s actions. Four out of 10 Arab Americans admit they are unsure about her stance, with older voters (69 percent) being the least informed. This suggests that even candidates who are theoretically more aligned with the Arab American perspective on this issue are struggling to break through the noise of the two-party system. While the Middle East remains a key concern, it is clear that domestic issues are just as important to Arab Americans. The economy and cost of living are at the top of their list of priorities, just below Palestine, followed by concerns about hate speech and discrimination. Trump, in particular, seems to have an edge when it comes to economic issues. More than half of male respondents believe he would be better for the US economy, as do a majority of middle-aged respondents and those with higher incomes. However, Trump’s candidacy comes with other concerns, particularly around the rise of hate speech. Nearly half of Arab Americans expect that hate speech against their community would increase under another Trump presidency, compared to less than a quarter who believe the same about Harris. This fear is particularly understandable when we look at the personal experiences of Arab Americans. Almost half of the respondents report experiencing harassment or hate attacks based on their ethnicity or religion, with those in the midwest and south reporting the highest rates of discrimination. Despite these concerns, Trump remains a strong contender for many Arab Americans, highlighting the tension between their hopes for economic improvement and their fears about social and racial justice. As the 2024 election approaches, Arab Americans find themselves at a crossroads. They are more politically engaged than ever before, and their vote could play a crucial role in several key swing states, but they are also more divided than ever, torn between competing visions for both the US and the Middle East. What is clear, though, is that the Arab American community is no longer a silent, overlooked minority. It is stepping into the political arena with force, ready to shape the future of a country it calls home, even as it grapples with the conflicts and challenges facing its ancestral homelands. For Arab Americans, this election is not just about choosing between Trump, Harris, or Stein. It is about asserting their place in American society and making sure their voices are heard — both for the sake of their community and for the broader world.

The White Woman’s Burden – OpEd	For all its obvious organizational authoritarianism and corruption, the Catholicism that reigned largely unchallenged in Western Europe in the ten or so centuries previous to the unveiling of Martin Luther’s95 Thesesin Wittenberg in 1517 was, and to a great extent still is, profoundly democratic in the way it looks at the intrinsic worth of human beings before God, holding that insofar as an individual decides to accept God’s grace, practice good works, and cleanse himself of sin through repentance, he or she can enjoy eternal salvation. However, as Max Weber argued in his justifiably renowned The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), Protestantism, and more specifically its Calvinist variant, changed much of this through its propagation of the doctrine of predestination; that is, the idea that 'only a small proportion of men are chosen for eternal grace' and that we humans, with our limited purview of creation are unable to discern exactly who among those in our midst has been called by to form part of this small cadre of God’s pre-chosen Elect. While Weber was primarily concerned with how the anxiety created by not knowing the ultimate disposition of their souls before God often drove people to try and prove their elect status before others through industriousness and the accumulation of wealth, the doctrine of predestination had many other important effects on the populations (such as our own) where Calvinism took root and played a key role in generating foundational cultural norms. Perhaps none of these is more important or consequential than the generalized acceptance of the idea that a select number among us, putative members of that predestined elite, not only have the right, but the obligation to correct and/or tame the moral comportment of their fellow citizens. Like most people raised in the US, I assumed as a young man that this was a universal cultural dynamic. But that was before I began my decades-long immersion in the cultures of Post-dictatorial Spain, Portugal, Italy, and numerous countries in Latin America, societies that Americans, raised knowingly or not on the many offshoots and variations of theBlack Legend, generally see as being cruelly corseted by the supposedly restrictive and personally invasive diktats of the Catholic Church. What I found, however, was the exact opposite of all that. I experienced cultures where the urge among self-selected seers to rise up in high moral dudgeon against the wayward comportment of others was largely non-existent, cultures where people young and old lived with their bodies, its basic functions, and their own sexuality with a naturalness and fearlessness that I had seldom known or seen growing up, cultures that, in the end, were deeply aware of the existence of puritanical priggishness of our Calvinistically-inflected cultures, with their self-appointed moral teachers, and often laughed derisively about it. And unlike so many of us raised within the Protestant pale of settlement, the citizens of these places often had no problem recognizing the link between our 'if-there-must-be-hidden-moral-paragons-among-us-they-might-as-well-be-me' outlook and the nature of contemporary Anglo-American imperialism. They could clearly see that when all the military and economic accoutrements of imperialism are stripped away, what remains is its spiritual core: the imperialist’s deeply held conviction that the elites of his tribe are morally superior beings who thus have the right and the responsibility to 'share' their enlightenment with the benighted non-Elect cultures of the world. In this context, it was supremely fitting that it was Rudyard Kipling, an Anglo-American living and working during the early years of the shift from British to American global primacy, who propounded the concept of the 'White Man’s Burden' in a now famouspoemof the same name. In it, he speaks of the need to 'wage savage wars of peace' against those living outside our bubble of superior civilization who are described in the text as 'silent, sullen peoples' who are 'half-devil and half-child.' In the quarter century or so immediately following World War II, a time marked by the decolonization of many parts of Asia and Africa, Kipling’s testosterone-infused ode to the task of inflicting superior Anglo-American culture on lesser beings was generally presented as an embarrassing reminder of a now wholly eclipsed vital outlook. But events soon showed this was not the case. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Anglo-American 'obligation' to 'wage savage wars of peace' on lesser others came back with a vengeance, but this time shorn of its vocabulary of overt disdain for its overseas tutees. In the 1990s, Anglo-American leadership cadres, aware of the off-putting nature of Kipling-style discourses, began speaking of other people’s need for lessons in something called Democracy. Those who agreed to be tutored in the art of this endlessly flexible concept were granted the title of allies. Those who believed they had a right to pursue their own indigenous vision of the good life were branded extremists, or if they were especially recalcitrant in their continuing devotion to their obviously backward native ways, terrorists. As the title of Kipling’s famous poem suggests, this practice of war-fueled moral beneficence was long an overwhelmingly male affair. But thanks to the advances wrought by feminism we can now rightfully speak of the White Woman’s Burden as well. Like their testosterone-laden forerunners, those assuming this honorable mantle possess a rock-solid belief that there is a moral elect embedded in almost every population whose job it is to liberate the majority from their weaknesses and superstitions through instruction, and if need be, loving coercion. But unlike their male counterparts, whose ways of teaching and helping mostly relied heavily on physical intimidation, our new female pedagogues tend to trade much more heavily in things like interpersonal boundary violations and reputational destruction. And whereas the violently helping spirit of our male elects was generally aimed at those outside their own grouping or tribe, our newly burdened white women elects are much more comfortable working domestically, doing things like declaring those long seen as being the necessary yin to their yang—men—as beingper setoxic, which is to say, belonging irremediably to the cohort of the eternally damned. And doing things like portraying the gift of fecundity, long seen as perhaps the world’s most precious commodity, into a regrettable curse. All this while fulsomely praising abortion and genital mutilation, something that only a few years ago many of their numbers decried as barbaric when it was being carried out by those lesser people in places like Africa. And perhaps most remarkable and surprising of all, these zealous new bearers of the White Woman’s Burden have made remarkably rapid inroads into the Catholic cultures of Europe and America that only a short time ago reflexively sniggered at the male version of the north’s Calvinist busybodyism. Today, you need only spend a few minutes in the Boho neighborhoods of Barcelona, Lisbon, or Mexico City, or listen to the media that both serves and is generated by people from those rarefied places, to imbibe today’s distaff descendants of theMinister of Genevasharing their moralizing magic with the benighted masses around them. Are we witnessing, as these moralizingmaenadsseem to think, a new beginning that will fundamentally reorder the nature of human relations down to the most basic and time-ratified drives and functions of our bodies? Or are we observing the chaotic and pitiful end to the 500-year project of European modernity which was fueled in no small part by its embedded doctrine of Calvinist predestination? If I were a betting man, I’d have to say the latter. Why? Because as the ancient Greeks told us with their stories of Icarus and Oedipus, man’s ingenuity and ability to transform his environment, while often prodigious, are in the end no match for the unimaginable creativity and power of the Gods. My sense is that these simple lessons, which modernity has bent over backward to portray as anachronistically irrelevant to our circumstance, are about to reassert themselves in ways that few in our class of enlightened male and female burden-bearers ever thought possible.

Why Has The Indian Stock Market Experienced A Long-Term Upward Tr...	By Xia Ri The rise of the Indian stock market is a long-term process. From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, the Indian stock market gradually began to gain attention. From around 2003 to before the 2008 financial crisis, the market experienced a noticeable upward trend. However, the global financial crisis in 2008 hit the Indian stock market hard, leading to significant declines. After the crisis, from 2009 to early 2020, the market gradually recovered and entered another upward phase. Since the beginning of 2020, despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, the Indian stock market has demonstrated strong resilience. It not only quickly recovered from the initial downturn due to the pandemic but also continued to maintain an upward trajectory. Overall, India has sustained a long bullish market for over a decade, with the Sensex 30 index rising nearly 800 times since its establishment in 1979, achieving positive returns in nearly 80% of the years over 45 years. The past five years have been particularly impressive, with an annualized return exceeding 17%. Meanwhile, the NIFTY 50 index closed at 26,216.05 points, increasing nearly 400 times over 24 years, with an annualized return of over 11.71%. According to researchers at ANBOUND, who have conducted long-term tracking, there are three main factors behind this phenomenon. First, the rapid and stable economic growth relies on demographic dividends and technological advancements. As an emerging economy, India has experienced relatively stable and fast economic growth in recent years. Its GDP growth rate has been among the highest in the world’s major economies, maintaining a high growth rate for several consecutive years. Since Narendra Modi took office in 2014, the country’s GDP has averaged a growth rate of 6%, except for the impact of the pandemic in 2020. In 2023, India’s GDP grew by 8.2% year-on-year, making it the fastest-growing economy among global economies. In the first half of 2024, India’s GDP growth rate was 7.2%. It is important to note that demographic dividends and technological advancements form the foundation of India’s long-term economic growth. India has a large population base, and according to UN projections, it is expected to become the most populous country by mid-2023, with a total population estimated at 1.426 billion, including over 845 million people aged 20 to 64, creating a relatively healthy pyramid structure. At the same time, India is not particularly rich in bulk resources; its growth primarily relies on demand-driven factors and technological innovation. Historically, India’s economic growth has been mainly contributed by the tertiary sector, including finance and IT services, which account for over 55% of its economy. With the global trend of offshore outsourcing, its abundant pool of IT engineers supports the sustained high growth of the IT services sector. Meanwhile, the Indian government is vigorously promoting manufacturing, driving the development of industries such as construction, building materials, and steel through infrastructure projects, while also facilitating the transfer of supply chains in sectors like apparel and mobile phones. Secondly, the government is vigorously promoting economic reforms, focusing on large-scale infrastructure and supporting manufacturing. The Modi administration's growth policies primarily center on significant infrastructure development and bolstering the manufacturing sector, with government investment being a major driver of India’s high economic growth. In terms of infrastructure, during the past decade in office, India has undertaken extensive infrastructure renovations, including modernizing transportation networks, improving urban facilities, and expanding digital infrastructure. By 2023, infrastructure investment had increased fivefold compared to 2014, with the national highway network expanding by 60%. The construction of the Bharatmala Pariyojna project has enhanced connectivity among India’s coasts, ports, and highways, while also significantly expanding metro, railway, and airport facilities. The number of airports has risen from 74 in 2014 to 158 by 2024. Meanwhile, in terms of industrial policy, the Modi government launched the 'Make in India' initiative to transform the traditionally service-dominated Indian economy. The goal is to increase India's share of global manufacturing from 3% to 5% by 2030, and to 10% by 2047. This includes promoting the privatization of state-owned enterprises, reducing direct government involvement in commercial activities, and gradually exiting certain non-strategic industries to enhance the operational efficiency of public enterprises. Starting in 2019, the Indian government began revising and consolidating several labor laws to simplify employment relationships and improve labor market mobility. These reform measures have increased operational efficiency for businesses and improved the investment environment in the market. Finally, the government has strengthened financial market reforms to attract a continuous inflow of foreign capital. In recent years, the Indian government has implemented a series of policy adjustments and reforms in the financial market. For instance, the Indian stock market has strict requirements for listed companies and a rigorous delisting system, ensuring the quality of publicly traded firms. If a listed company is found to have financial fraud or underperformance, it will be subject to mandatory delisting. At the same time, the trading system in the Indian stock market is relatively flexible and favorable for retail investors. Retail investors operate under a T+0 trading system, while institutional investors follow a T+3 one. In addition, the Indian stock market places a strong emphasis on investor protection. The exit buyback and its pricing mechanism safeguard the rights of public investors. The Indian stock exchanges appoint independent valuation teams to assess the stocks of companies that are forcibly delisted. These companies must buy back their shares from all public shareholders at the valuation price determined by the team within three months of the delisting decision, unless investors voluntarily choose to continue holding the shares. Attracted by strong economic growth and ongoing financial market reforms, foreign capital has consistently net bought Indian stocks over the long term. Between 2000 and 2023, foreign investors only had net sales in 2008, 2011, 2018, and 2022; in all other years, there were net purchases. In 2023 alone, the net purchase was approximately USD 21.4 billion, ranking fourth among annual net inflows of foreign capital. As of the end of January 2024, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) held about 16% of the market capitalization of Indian stocks. Overall, the long-term upward trend of the Indian stock market is underpinned by the rapid and stable growth of the Indian economy, which relies on demographic dividends and technological advancements. At the same time, India is actively promoting economic reforms, focusing on large-scale infrastructure and supporting manufacturing. Additionally, the Indian government has strengthened financial market reforms in recent years, attracting a continuous inflow of foreign capital. It is worth noting that while the Indian stock market has a trend of long-term growth, it is still defined by ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan as an emerging market country. For the West, India today is an alternative to the Chinese market, and this has artificially elevated India's position in the global market. In this context, the performance of the Indian economy and market will continue to experience fluctuations, similar to other emerging markets, and it will be affected by the country’s unavoidable political landscape and national conditions. Final analysis conclusion: For decades, the long-term upward trend of the Indian stock market has been driven by the rapid and stable growth of the Indian economy, relying on demographic dividends and technological advancements. At the same time, India has been actively promoting economic reforms, focusing on large-scale infrastructure development and supporting manufacturing. Additionally, this is also contributed by the Indian government’s strengthening of financial market reforms in the recent years to attract a continuous inflow of foreign capital.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmURCtHhrZJhjm	2024-10-21T16:55:47-07:00	
Mystery Still Surrounds Death Of UN Chief Hammarskjöld, 63 Years ...	By Vibhu Mishra One of the most enduring mysteries in United Nations history – the 1961 plane crash that killed Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and all on board as he sought to broker peace in the Congo – will linger on, with a new assessment announced on Friday suggesting that 'specific and crucial' information continues to be withheld by a handful of Member States. Mr. Hammarskjöld served as Secretary-General from April 1953 until his death aged 56, when the chartered Douglas DC6 aircraft he was travelling in with others, registered as SE-BDY, crashed shortly after midnight on 17-18 September 1961, near Ndola, then in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). He was en route to negotiate a ceasefire between UN peacekeepers and separatists from the breakaway Congolese region of Katanga, and possibly even a peace agreement encompassing the whole of newly independent Congo. Fourteen of the 15 passengers died on impact, and the sole survivor succumbed to their injuries a few days later. An initial inquiry by Rhodesian authorities reportedly attributed the crash to pilot error but the finding was disputed. Eyewitness accounts suggested several scenarios, that 'more than one aircraft' – possibly a jet – was observed in the air, 'SE-BDY was on fire before it crashed', and/or 'SE-BDY was fired upon or otherwise actively engaged' by another aircraft. General Assembly action Over the years, the UN General Assembly has mandated a series of inquiries into the death of Mr. Hammarskjöld and those of his party. The most recent, in December 2022, was led by Mohamed Chande Othman, former Chief Justice of Tanzania, with the formal title of 'Eminent Person'. Mr. Othman also led several previous investigations into the fateful crash and the events surrounding it. On Friday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres transmitted Mr. Othman’s latest report to the Assembly. On the first day of his second term, Secretary-General Hammarskjöld (back of car, at right) leaves UN Headquarters on the way to the luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in his honour, hosted by New York City Mayor Robert Wagner. Significant new information According to the UN’s Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq, 'significant new information' has been submitted to the inquiry for this latest update. This included probable intercepts by Member States of communications related to the crash, the capacity of Katanga’s armed forces, or others, to mount an attack on SE-BDY and the involvement of foreign paramilitary or intelligence personnel in the area at the time. It also included additional new information relevant to the context and surrounding events of 1961. 'At this juncture, [Mr. Othman] assesses it to remain plausible that an external attack or threat was a cause of the crash. [He] notes that the alternative hypotheses that appear to remain available are that the crash resulted from sabotage or unintentional human error,' Mr. Haq said. Documents almost certainly withheld However, Mr. Othman assesses so far that it is 'almost certain' specific, crucial and so far undisclosed information exists in the archives of Member States, Mr. Haq said. He noted that Mr. Othman has not received, to date, specific responses to his queries from some Member States believed to be holding useful information. 'The Secretary-General has personally followed up on [Mr. Othman’s] outstanding requests for information and calls upon Member States to release any relevant records in their possession,' Mr. Haq added. 'With significant progress having been made, the Secretary-General calls on all of us to renew our resolve and commitment to pursue the full truth of what happened on that fateful night in 1961.' View of the field at Ndola, Zambia, where the plane carrying Mr. Hammarskjöld and his party crashed the night of 17-18 September, 1961; the site is marked by a cairn. ‘An extraordinary man’ Appointed at just 47 years old, Dag Hammarskjöld of Sweden remains the youngest UN Secretary-General. Widely regarded as a visionary diplomat and reformer, Mr. Hammarskjöld is credited with strengthening the role of the newly established UN during a period of intense global tensions, including the drive to decolonise Africa and Asia. 'Hammarskjöld was not usually a companionable man, but he was certainly an extraordinary one, and we were all prepared – indeed anxious – to serve him without question to the limit of our powers and endurance,' Sir Brian Urquhart, a former senior UN official, remarked. His leadership was pivotal during the tumultuous events of 1956. He led a ceasefire mission to the Middle East and continued through the Suez crisis, where he helped negotiate the withdrawal of foreign forces from Egypt and oversaw the deployment of the Organization’s first emergency peacekeeping mission, the UN Emergency Force. Mr. Hammarskjöld was known for his integrity and dedication to public service, earning the Nobel Peace Prize 'for developing the UN into an effective and constructive international organization capable of giving life to the principles and aims expressed in the UN Charter'. He is the only Nobel Peace Prize Laureate to have been awarded the distinction posthumously.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUZE1jK9dNXbn	2024-10-21T16:51:12-07:00	
Thailand: Ruling Pheu Thai Party May Survive Threat Of Dissolutio...	By Jon Preechawong Thailand’s ruling Pheu Thai may just survive a court-ordered disbandment, this time, analysts said, adding that this was a wake-up call to the party that should not take its coalition’s stability for granted. The Thai Election Commission (EC), which is investigating whether the party illegally took advice from a non-member and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, said it would take at least a month to finish its probe. The poll body said it had set up an investigative committee after it received petitions saying Pheu Thai had violated the law that says political parties must remain independent, failing which they would be disbanded. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who is from Pheu Thai and Thaksin’s daughter, said she was not worried about the petitions, with analysts such as Thanaporn Sriyakul of Kasetsart University noting that she may not have much to be concerned about – for now. 'In principle, it doesn’t seem to have reached the point where Pheu Thai could be dissolved, but the party cannot afford to be complacent,' Thanaporn, chairman of Kasetsart University’s Political Science Association, told BenarNews. 'For accusations of party dominance by a ‘big boss’ like Thaksin, there must be concrete evidence. Therefore, it is unlikely that any party will be dissolved over this,' he added. If the EC finds that the petitions against Pheu Thai have merit, it will forward the case to the Constitutional Court, which will decide. Thai courts have been used to end political parties at least 17 times since 2007. The Pheu Thai Party is seen as a replacement for the People's Power Party (PPP), which was dissolved by the Constitutional Court. And the People's Power Party had replaced Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT), which was met a court-ordered end. In August, the Constitutional Court ordered the progressive Move Forward Party, which had won the most seats in the national election, to dissolve. The court also banned its top leaders from politics for 10 years, for promising during the 2023 electoral campaign that they would abolish the country’s strict royal defamation law The petitioners demanding Pheu Thai’s dissolution include some of the country’sconservative forces, including those with strong anti-Thaksin sentiments and who have historically aligned with the military, Thanaporn added. They are Warong Dechgitvigrom, leader of the Thai Pakdee Party; Ruangkrai Leekitwattana, a member of the Palang Pracharath Party; Nopparuj Worachitwutikul, a former leader of the White Dove Conservative Political Group; and an unnamed individual. They question Thaksin’s alleged involvement in hosting a meeting at his residence on August 14 with leaders of the ruling coalition government after his ally Srettha Thavisin’scourt-ordered dismissalas prime minister over a questionable cabinet appointment. Thaksin’s actions, the petitions said, suggested he was exercising influence or direct involvement in the activities of Pheu Thai and its coalition partners. The ex-PM is a populist yet divisive figure in Thai politics. He is seen by some observers as apower brokerfor his daughterPaetongtarn,who became PM after Srettha was dismissed. Thaksin was elected prime minister in 2001 until he was forced from office in 2006 by a military coup. He fled Thailand in 2008 to escape a prison term for charges that he maintains were politically motivated. After living in exile, he returned to Thailand last year when Pheu Thai regained control of the government and Srettha was installed as PM. But it has not been smooth sailing for Pheu Thai’s coalition government, first with the investigation and eventual dismissal of Srettha and the latest petitions for the party's dissolution. However, political analyst Olarn Thinbangtieo, from Burapha University, said the non-military elite still needed Pheu Thai on the political scene and that it will ensure the party survives. 'I don’t believe Pheu Thai will be dissolved because the political elite still needs the party to continue playing a role in Thai politics,' Olarn, an associate professor of political science, told BenarNews. 'The EC is merely processing these complaints to avoid accusations of negligence.' ‘A political game’ Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters that unending court challenges and other complaints could have economic consequences. 'The EC is doing its job, but it’s unsettling that any complaint, no matter how minor, can become a major issue. These constant accusations against the Prime Minister create uncertainty, which affects investor confidence and harms the economy,' he said. 'But as for the party, we’re not worried. The coalition partners are also unconcerned, and we are ready to explain ourselves.' As Paetongtarn told reporters, 'We are not worried.' EC Secretary-General Sawang Boonmee said that the commission’s aim was to finish the investigation into the petitions in a month. 'The EC will complete the investigation within 30 days, with the possibility of 30-day extensions until the process is finished,' he said. Two young Thais said they believed the attempts to dissolve Pheu Thai were a scheme to gain more say in the government. 'The petition to dissolve Pheu Thai is clearly a political game,' Kittin Likitparinya, a 28-year-old office worker in Bangkok, told BenarNews. Akkarawut Poomchua, 38, who is an office manager in central Bangkok, said he did not think Pheu Thai would be ordered to disband. 'If it’s not the Orange Party [Move Forward], then I think the rest of the parties will survive,' he told BenarNews. 'The petitions to dissolve Pheu Thai are just tools in the power-sharing game.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUfOstgFSuGen	2024-10-21T16:46:35-07:00	
What Makes Something A Monopoly? – OpEd	By Walter Block Is Google a monopoly? No. What about the National Association of Realtors—does it deserve this moniker? Certainly not. Did monopoly status ever fit Rockefeller’s Standard Oil of New Jersey? Not at all. How about IBM during its years-long antitrust case? Fuhgeddaboudit. Is monogamous marriage a monopoly? You’ve got to be kidding. Is the US Post Office a monopoly? Yes. Is the American Medical Association a monopoly? You bet your boots it is. Is the New York City yellow cab taxi medallion system a monopoly? This cannot be denied. When the British ran India, they prohibited anyone else from mining salt from the ocean. Was that a monopoly? Of course it was. What is going on here? What is going on here is that there are two very, very different types of businesses taking place. They are both characterized in the same manner—as monopolies—despite these gigantic differences. They are as alike as chalk and cheese, as fish and bicycles, as oil and water. We do exceedingly well to distinguish between them. One description is entirely legitimate; the other is a snare and a delusion. Let us start with the sensible, accurate, historical definition. Traditionally, amonopolywas a grant of special privilege, given by the ruler of the country. It allowed one and only one person, or company, to provide a given product in a limited geographical area. The Duke of London fought the good fight in the battle, and was awarded the monopoly of candle making in that city by the King of England. Or the Count of Monte Cristo did something similar, and the King of France decreed that no one but this nobleman could legally produce wine in that area of the country. Any other person who provided these goods in those areas was headed toward the hoosegow (unless he first purchased permission from the owner of the monopoly). These are made-up examples of course, but they help answer the question of why the list in the first paragraph are not monopolies, while any of those mentioned afterward are. Will anyone competing with Google, IBM, Standard Oil, etc. be imprisoned? Don’t be silly, of course not. So none of these is a monopolist. However, if you drive a cab in the Big Apple or practice medicine without a license or deliver First-Class Mail for a fee, that will be your fate. The prison walls will be opening to accept you as a guest. What about marriage? Will you be jailed if you seek and obtain a divorce? Not at all. Thus, there is no real monopoly herein. Move along, there is nothing to see here, monopoly-wise. A second type of 'monopoly' is very different. Here, we look not to legal prohibitions but rather at concentration ratios. IBM at one time was responsible for virtually all computers (strictly speaking, that was an oligopoly, since the 100% level was not attained); ditto for Standard Oil for almost all of this product; Google is now in a similar position, it is claimed. So they are all 'monopolists' in this misleading sense of the word. Right now, McDonald’s is very successful, but merely one of many purveyors of fast food. But suppose that one day this company beats out all of its competitors such as Burger King, Wendy’s, Sonic, Jack in the Box, Carl’s, Steak ’n Shake, etc. with lower prices, a better-tasting burger, and cleaner restrooms. Ronald McDonald is certainly not a monopolist, in the anti-market sense. No one would go to jail for continuing to compete with this now-colossus of burgers. But this company is certainly a 'monopoly' in the sense that is compatible with free enterprise. They account for 100% of this industry. Ronald, more accurately, should be called a single-seller, not a monopolist. There is more wrong with misusing the wordmonopolythan you can shake a stick at. What, pray tell, is an 'industry'? Fast food competes with groceries and upscale restaurants. It also vies for the consumer dollar with the sellers of motorcycles, violins, sailboats, and shoes. The consumer can spend his money on anything under the sun that is for sale. Monogamous marriage would also have to be characterized as a 'monopoly' if we follow the 'logic' of this definition to its ultimate end. For each spouse relies on the other to a 100% degree for certain limited 'services.' Let us sic the antitrust authorities on such folk. They have been thus far derelict in their duty to promote 'competition' in this regard. If these bureaucrats can prohibit mergers—can punish companies for successfully satisfying consumers—they should ban all such marriages too. There is good and sufficient reason to end all monopolies that are special grants of government privilege. There is no case for not allowing competition in postal, sanitation, taxi, and fire protection services. Milton Friedman in hisCapitalism and Freedomdemonstrates that this applies even to physicians: they should be certified, like CPAs, not monopoly-licensed. Further, antitrust is exceedingly expensive. There are numerous highly paid and thus very productive lawyers, accountants, economists—on both sides of every such lawsuit—who could be far better employed producing actual goods and services. But what about the 'deadweight loss' of the economist? This is a figment of his imagination. It is an exercise in dreaming about invalid interpersonal comparisons of utility. Tell it to happily married monogamous spouses that they would be economically better off if they spread their wings a bit. Then, there is the critique concerning collusion. Here is a response. First of all, 'I’m firm, you’re stubborn, he’s a pig-headed fool' can describe the identical substantive behavior, but places three widely dispersed evaluations on it (this is known asRussell Conjugation). Similarly, I cooperate, you plot, he colludes; this, in like manner, merely engages in name-calling. There is nothing substantive gained in calling cooperation collusion. Secondly, the legitimacy of the collusion/cooperation all depends upon what the goal is of all this planning. Is it to try to become a monopolist by legislatively banning competition? Then, yes, the collusion is illicit. Or is it to increase the plotter’s concentration ratio within the 'industry' by becoming more efficient and wooing away competitors’ customers via lower prices, a better product, and more reliability? Then matters are well and good, and this goes for all the 'collusion' in the world.

Why People Pay Higher Prices For Some Goods Relative To Others – ...	By Frank Shostak Why are individuals willing to pay higher prices for some goods relative to other goods? The common reply to this appeals to the laws of supply and demand. But what is behind these laws? To provide a further answer to this question economists refer to the law of diminishing marginal utility. Mainstream economics explains this law in terms of the satisfaction that one derives from consuming a particular good. For instance, an individual may derive vast satisfaction from consuming one cone of ice cream. The satisfaction he will derive from consuming a second cone might also be large but not as large as the satisfaction derived from the first cone. The satisfaction from the consumption of a third cone is likely to diminish further, and so on. From this, mainstream economics concludes that the more of any good we consume in a given period, the less satisfaction (or utility) we derive out of each additional, marginal unit. This also entails that, if the marginal utility of a product declines as the supply of this product increases, the price that we are willing to pay per unit also declines. Utility, according to the mainstream, is presented as a certain quantity that increases at a diminishing pace as one consumes more of a particular good. Since various goods generate different amounts of utility, mainstream economists mistakenly conclude that consumers should allocate their money income in such a way that the marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for all goods purchased. Menger’s Explanation of Value-Formation The question that arises is how can one talk about the utility or benefit that a good offers without stipulating the end that a particular good serves?Accordingto Carl Menger—the founder of the Austrian School of Economics—individuals ordinally rank goods in accordance to the ends those goods are thought to accomplish. Various ends that individuals find subjectively important in any given moment are valued in a descending order. Consider John the baker, who has produced four loaves of bread. The four loaves are his resources or means that he employs to attain various ends. Let us say that his highest end is to have one loaf of bread to feed and sustain himself. With the second loaf of bread, John exchanges it for five tomatoes, which helps him to secure his second most important end. John then uses the third loaf of bread to exchange it for a shirt—his third most important end. Finally, John decides that he will allocate his fourth loaf to feed wild birds. Feeding the wild birds is ranked as the fourth end on the John’s priority list as far as his life and wellbeing is concerned. We can see that each loaf of bread serves a different end and that the ends are ranked ordinally, according to which wants they satisfy first. This implies that the first loaf of bread carries much higher subjective importance than the second loaf because of the more important end that the first loaf secures. Thus, if a single loaf of bread is lost, the lowest end will be sacrificed before the higher ends. Value, Price, and the Lowest-Ranked End Now, because John regards each of the four loaves of bread in his possession as interchangeable (homogeneous units), he imputes to each individual loaf of bread the value of the lowest-ranked end, which is feeding wild birds. Why does the least important end serve as the standard for valuing the loaves of bread? Could John, theoretically, decide to use the highest end—eating a loaf to survive—as the standard of value for each additional loaf of bread? In answer, consider that to satisfy his second end—to obtain five tomatoes—John would have to exchange (give up) the one loaf of bread for five tomatoes, however, if a loaf of bread is valued more highly by John than five tomatoes, obviously no exchange will take place. Therefore, when a good (like a loaf of bread) becomes more abundant, it necessarily cannot be valued at the same level of the highest-ranked want it satisfies. Since the fourth loaf of bread is the last unit in John’s total supply, it is also called themarginal unit—the unit at the margin. This marginal unit secures the least important subjective end. Alternatively, we can also say that the marginal unit provides the least benefit as far the individual’s valuation is concerned. If John had only three loaves of bread this would mean that each loaf would be valued by the third end—having a shirt. From this, we can infer that as the supply of bread declines, the marginal utility of bread increases. This means that each individual loaf of bread will be valued more highly now than before the supply of bread declined. Conversely, as the supply of bread increases, its marginal utility declines because each loaf of bread is now valued less than before the increase in the supply took place. When confronted with various goods, an individual makes his choice based on the suitability of goods to be employed as means to various ends. Ends are ranked with respect to subjective value at a given moment. Of course, a limitation on achieving various ends is the availability of suitable means. To quell thirst in the desert, an individual requires water. Gold in his possession will be of no help in this regard. Following Menger’s framework, we can establish why the price of gold should be higher than the price of bread, all other things being equal, even though bread can sustain life and gold cannot. The simple reason for this is because gold is scarcer than bread. Where gold and bread exist and are subjectively valued by individuals, because gold is scarce and bread is abundant, the price of gold is higher than the price of bread. According to mainstream economics, individuals are presented as if a valuation scale is hard-wired in their heads. Regardless of anything else, this scale remains the same all the time, despite changing preferences and circumstances. On the other hand, we mustacknowledgethat there can be novaluationwithout subjective ends or goals to be valued. Value is established once an individual’s mind has interacted with a particular good. The mind, then, establishes an end or purpose for which a particular good could be of use. Given time and space limitations, choices must be made of what goals to satisfy and in what order. Hence, the ordinal valuation scale emerges. This also means that the value scale does not remain permanently fixed. On this reality, Carl Mengerwrote, Value is thus nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, nor an independent thing existing by itself. It is a judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and wellbeing. Hence value does not exist outside the consciousness of men. Also, marginal utility is not, as the mainstream perspective presents, an addition to the total utility but rather the utility of the marginal end.Accordingto Rothbard, 'there is no such thing as ‘total utility,’ only the marginal utility of alarger-sizedunit. The size of the unit depends on its relevance to the particular action.' Conclusion Following the thought of Carl Menger, a particular end sets the value for the corresponding means. Ends are not set arbitrarily but in accordance to its suitability to support an individual’s subjective values. In this sense, individuals’ valuations are always in reference to the facts of reality.

Beyond Food Security: The Potential Gendered Consequences Of Food...	By Dr Caroline Delgado and Dr Simone Bunse In conflict-affected humanitarian settings where there are high levels of food insecurity, women and men face distinct challenges that can deeply affectgender relations. The same is true of food aid. Recognizing this, food aid delivery in conflict settings is often designed to take into account these gendered impacts and challenges—and sometimes even aims to transform gender relations in a lasting way. However, well-intended actions can have unintended negative gendered consequences, contributing to stigma or the risk of violence. This blog explores how and why this may be the case and what can be done about it. While there can be negative impacts for both men and women, this piece primarily focuses on women, who often bear a disproportionate share of the burden due to pre-existing gender inequalities, which can be exacerbated by aid. Gendered impacts of conflict and food insecurity Conflict profoundly changes the day-to-day realities of individuals, households and vulnerable groups. Gender can have a major influence on how these changes play out. For example, fighting is most often done by men, who thus face the majority of battlefield casualties. As a result, conflict tends to increase the number of female-headed households, who even in peacetime often face significant challenges in accessing income, credit, land and property. And women are particularly vulnerable to conflict-related food insecurity caused by disrupted agriculture, inflated food prices and displacement due to pre-existing structural inequalities that limit their ability to cope and recover. Conflict often obliges women to take on traditionally male roles and responsibilities—not just in the household but also in the market and wider society, and even in armed struggle. This can sometimes lead to positive change in gender relations, opening new opportunities and changing expectations. In other cases it can increase stigma and put them at greater risk. Conflict also greatly exacerbates the risk of violence against women. In some conflict settings, up to 70 per cent of womenexperience gender-based violencecompared to35 per centglobally. Conflict-driven food insecurity can heighten tensions within a household and lead to intimate partner violence. Additionally, armed actors often target women as awar tactic. The combination of structural gender inequalities and women becoming targets can then exacerbate other forms of violence, including ‘transactional sex’ (also known as survival sex) and child marriage. Three humanitarian approaches and their unintended gendered impacts The ways that humanitarian actors confront gender issues in their delivery of aid can be summarized in three broad categories:needs-based, instrumentalistandhuman rights-based. These reflect the actors’ mandates, strategies andbiases. All of these approaches are valid, and generally overlap in practice. However, each of them also has potential pitfalls that can contribute to unintentionally harmful impacts. Food aid based on needs The needs-based approach prioritizes aid delivery according to assessed needs, regardless of gender or other forms of identity. This approach seeks to embody the humanitarian principles of impartiality and neutrality. However, it can unintentionally expose women to greater risk in some cases. For example, needs assessments often result inmore women than menbenefiting from food programmes. Although women frequently are more vulnerable in conflict settings, emphasizing their heightened vulnerability and beneficiary status canundermine their agencyand reinforce gendered power imbalances.Humanitarian messagingoften depicts women as victims, sometimes lumping them together with children as in need of protection. Portraying women as passive victims in this way disempowers them and excludes them from decision making, including about how aid is delivered, which can result in their needs being overlooked. Moreover, food aid delivery that fails to recognize how traditional gender roles have been transformed by conflict can contribute to a regression of women’s improved social standing. For example, livelihood interventions for former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) combatants inColombiaat times portrayed women as victims of highly patriarchal FARC structures, ignoring the roles and power of women within the group. Thisreinforced traditional gender divisions, for example by offering training in areas like sewing, soap-making and hairdressing, neglecting women’s broader aspirations for equality in decision making and participation even in traditionally male-dominated areas. Instrumentalizing women for better aid delivery Theinstrumentalist approachto gender in humanitarian aid takes advantage of women’s traditional role in the provision and management of food. An example of the instrumentalist approach is giving cash-based transfers (CBTs) to women. The rationale for this practice builds onevidencethat women are more likelythan mento use the cash for the family’s food, health and education and to buy more varied andnutritious foodthan men would. Another example is organizations involving women in the targeting, distribution and collection of food rations, based on the assumption that women are likely to use them more efficiently than men. While the instrumentalist approach emphasizes women’s agency in relation to food, it risks reinforcing traditional gender relations and can even create new risks, rather than transforming power dynamics and promoting gender equality. For example, while CBTs provide critical financial support and empower women in contexts where they traditionally lack control over money, there is evidence that they can also interfere with men’s traditional authority over household finances, exposing women to harm. In households where gender-based power imbalances are large, CBTs can, in certain circumstances, contribute toviolence between partnersand the cash being taken by husbands or male relatives. Women carrying cash may also be at greater risk of being harassed by other community members or robbed by criminals or armed groups. One survey by a CBT programme inSomaliafound 20 per cent of female respondents had received threats. More research is needed into how the distribution of CBTs impacts women’s safety, as the existing evidence is stilllimitedand largely anecdotal. Food aid can also unintentionally worsen violence if it overlooks the unique risks and vulnerabilities faced by men. For example, in cattle-herding communities where herd size determines wealth, power and food security,conflict-driven livestock lossescan diminish men’s social standing. Since food is seen as a woman’s domain, men mayhesitate to participatein food security programming if it challenges gender norms. The loss of livelihood can breed frustration, increasing the likelihood that men willturn to violence and criminal activity. Food as a human right The human rights-based approach to food aid delivery focuses on protecting and promoting people’s rights, rather than simply addressing needs. It views people not as beneficiaries but as rights-holders with entitlements, and implementing organizations and governments as duty-bearers with corresponding obligations. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee embodies this approach in itsgender policy, which highlights gender equality and women’s empowerment as key principles in humanitarian work. In conflict-affected humanitarian settings, opportunities often arise to transform harmful gender relations, redress inequalities and remove structural barriers. Gender equality is seen as necessary for achievingSustainable Development Goal 2(zero hunger), where everyone can exercise their right to food. Thus, such opportunities should be taken whenever possible. However, it must be done carefully and in a conflict-sensitive way. Too strong an emphasis on transforming gender relations can clash with local values and norms (as well as with other humanitarian principles,particularly those of impartiality and neutrality), potentially exacerbating violence against women. For example, in communities where women and girls face high levels ofsystemic discriminationandbarriers to justice, they may face a backlash if they areencouraged to assert their rights. Similarly, when aid is conditioned on the promotion of universal human rights, it may be seen as coercive, creating mistrust or rejection. Going forward A conflict-sensitive and context-sensitive, intentional approach to transforming gender relations canmitigate many of the unintended, harmful gendered impacts of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian actors should not only have deep knowledge of local social norms and how they evolve, but they must also set realistic ambitions that balance humanitarian principles and human rights with the risk of unintended consequences. While local customs are an essential part of regulating social behaviour, they can also be exclusionary and contribute to conflict. Humanitarian awareness-raising efforts should be designed totrigger reflection on exclusionary practices, including the tensions between customs and international human rights law. This can be done more effectively when interventions involve local change agents, including both men and women. Gender stereotypes whereby women are viewed as household managers or as victims of violence and men as decision makers or as perpetrators of violenceneed to be questioned and challenged, and can underlie some of the negative gendered consequences of food aid. Instead, food aid delivery needs to be based on a nuanced understanding is needed of the diverse roles, responsibilities and challenges that shape the way women and men in that particular setting. Gender-transformative programming should be informed by the perspectives of those most marginalized by gender inequality to be truly effective. Even if women’s empowerment and protection are not the primary objectives of food aid, opportunities and needs in these areas should be systematically analysed and acted on. Humanitarian actors should continually monitor for unintended gendered impacts of their activities. There is also an ongoing need to analyse how food aid can contribute to breaking cycles of violence in the first place.

The West’s Hairy Mess: A Dispatch From The End-Times – OpEd	If anyone asks me, years down the road, after the collapse that’s coming has already occurred, when is the moment you realized the West’s elites and the sick society they have created in their image are beyond redemption?, I will not be surprised if I think to point to the recent morning when the Flipboard app I use to comb through daily articles from a variety of publications across the political, intellectual and cultural spectrum decided that I simply needed to be told that an exhibition of female pubic hair is now open in Paris. My first thought was to wonder what I had done to deserve this, what it was in my list of expressed interests or in my browsing history that had manifested this repugnant content. The only possibility that came to mind is that a recent instalment of biohacker Dave Asprey’s 'Human Upgrade' podcast I had fast-forwarded my way through the previous night had featured a 'best of' compendium of three debased, worldly hags speaking in graphic detail of hacks falling into the absurd category of 'maximizing sexual performance.' I had my doubts, however, that Flipboard was responding to the content of a podcast. And when I later saw that an exhibition called 'Shadow-Ban,' devoted to the subject of sex and its suppression in modern art, is now open at the SHOWStudio in London, I had no doubt where things stood: all of these were just sad signs of the times. The Dazed article profiling the pubic hair exhibit, to which I will not include a link to avoid driving more eyes to quasi-pornographic material, contained its own link to the exhibit’s homepage, including images that clearly cross the line into pure NSFW territory. As the article explained, the exhibit’s creators’ 'artistry' consisted in styling and adorning the pubic hair to 'match each models’ [sic] personality and their ‘amazing and strong characters.’' The exhibit’s site served up a mélange of the sorts of vapid lean-in girl-power gestures and pseudo-intellectual pablum that have become commonplace for such occasions. Here is a sampling: Central toMotherlandis the female gaze—a lens of empathy, understanding, and solidarity. In stark contrast to the often-objectifying male gaze, Guen Fiore, Nastya Klychkova, Yumiko Hikage, and Lynski—portray their subjects with a depth and authenticity that challenge traditional representations of women in art and media…. The fact that these women have come together to explore such a profound theme speaks to the power of female solidarity, a concept central to the feminist movement and eloquently articulated by bell hooks…. At the heart ofMotherlandis the exploration of pubic hair as a symbol of identity and self-acceptance…. The project approaches this theme with a sense of humor and playfulness, yet without losing its depth.' The lightness with whichMotherlandhandles these serious themes is not to be mistaken for superficiality. Rather, it reflects a deep understanding of the power of humor to disarm and to invite deeper reflection….. Philosophically, Motherlandcan be seen as a dialogue with the existentialist tradition, particularly the ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Against the charge of superficiality, the ladies responsible for this simultaneously nauseating and banal display certainly do protest too much. To devote an exhibit to pubic hair is to enact an all-but-(for a few inches-)wholly literal exercise in the sort of navel-gazing that has become a civilizational hallmark in the 21st century West. No longer able to generate novel culture, we chew our own cud, regurgitating old bits stripped of context and process them into fodder for re-use as samples, re-tellings or — our favorite — gagging on our own vomit by using glorious cultural achievements as occasions to condemn past masters for their purported infractions against contemporary shibboleths. Such reactions are what the great literary critic Harold Bloom would have characterized as outgrowths of resentment driven by our 'anxiety of influence,' the sense that we are overdetermined by the insurmountable greatness of our cultural patrimony. As the prominent critic George Steiner wrote in 1986, 'It may be that in no civilization preceding ours, save in hieratic Byzantium, has the domination of the canonized and heuristic past lain as heavily on the innovative aspirations of the present. Latest estimates tell us that of all ‘classical’ music performed publicly, recorded and broadcast in the West, nearly ninety per cent predates 1900.' Our inordinate fixation on the body and its lower functions, especially sexuality, likewise entails a type of regression on both an individual and societal level. Freud famously argued that a civilization could only be built upon the suppression of our more primal sexual and violent urges, while the healthy sublimation of those urges gave rise to monumental works of art and culture. The mid-20th-century Frankfurt School, however, gave us a Marx-Freud mashup that held — Herbert Marcuse in his Eros and Civilization (1955) being the foremost proponent of this view — that sexual repression was not a necessary hallmark of civilization, but rather, a particular product of repressive capitalism, while a non-repressive civilization would be laced through and through with libidinal energy that was not limited to genitally focused sexuality and, instead, infused in every aspect of our lives. Another Frankfurt School alum, Wilhelm Reich, the man responsible for coining the term 'sexual revolution,' had such a deranged personal and professional preoccupation with the liberating power of sexuality, including child and adolescent sexuality, that he fell out of favor with both traditional Marxists and Freudians for his excessive preoccupation with sex and was ultimately jailed for selling quack 'orgone' (i.e., orgasmic energy) cures — but not before having had a fateful influence on the proliferation of sex ed in schools, which he saw, along with contraception and abortion on demand, as a method for decoupling sex from procreation. As more and more taboos and restraints have gone by the wayside in succeeding decades, there have been various attempts to explain our growing obsession with sexuality. Christopher Lasch, in The Culture of Narcissism contended that, under late capitalism, '[t]he degradation of work and the impoverishment of communal life force people to turn to sexual excitement to satisfy all their emotional needs.' In his Sex, Ecology, Spirituality, Ken Wilber argued that in a world in which our prevailing scientific materialism consigns all manner of spiritual pursuits to the realm of pseudoscience, sex comes to take on an outsized role because it is one of the few outlets that seems to offer a materially grounded gateway to higher states: 'When an authentic spiritual realization is no longer part of serious discourse, then endless digging into the personal libido is one of the only and lonely substitutes.' In reality, however, as Wilber explained, 'in ‘digging down’ into the libido, one was not actually digging toward any great depths, but more or less the opposite: one was suspending the deeper or higher cognitive faculties in order to temporarily regress to a lower and shallower and more ontologically surface level.' Without dismissing these and other potentially compelling accounts, I would venture a somewhat different explanation that takes stock of this important fact: actual sexual activity, solo sexual activity included, is on the wane across all age groups. It is only focus on sexual matters — whether shapes, sizes and features of bodies, women’s clothes that keep leaving less and less to the imagination with each passing year or our obsession with sexual and gender identities — that remains ubiquitous. The best account of what is going on, therefore, cannot draw on any excitement or stimulation derived from direct participation in sex itself. The story that hangs together the best in my view is one that speaks of the cheap thrill of superficial transgression. As many thinkers have observed, our societies throughout the West have become unmoored from traditional narratives that grounded them in higher spiritual realities, leaving us adrift and searching for ever-more-elusive sources of deeper meaning in a world composed solely of material things. Great creators of the increasingly secular 20th century — whether James Joyce, Marcel Proust, D.H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf or Wallace Stevens — sought refuge from anomie in hard-won aesthetic reworkings of everyday experience, but the short-attention-span audiovisual culture in which we are now mired has left us, even students at elite universities, unable to achieve the deep immersion necessary to grapple with the great works of the past or, all the more, to create our own instalments that vie for a place in that monumental tradition. An alternative response also emerged in the 20th century, escalating during its latter years, a response that, in lieu of engaging with the tradition, met it with primal defiance, a raised middle finger. Taking forms like dada, abstract expressionism, brutalism, minimalism, punk rock, industrial music, gangster rap, street poetry and pulp fiction, such anti-art, even if hardly any of its creators would ever have admitted as much, grew out of an implicit acknowledgment of defeat, a buckling under the tradition’s weight yielding squelched, suffocated gestures — but, with various notable exceptions, did not succeed, in the manner of someone like Samuel Beckett, in parlaying that attitude of defeat into any sort of transcendent irony. Giving up the pursuit of perfection or beauty, these modes of art consigned themselves to — or outright embraced — imperfection and ugliness. And as time passed, the outcry of defiance that once seemed fresh went stale, its various instalments becoming cruder, more banal and repetitive. It became a pose, a commodity, a fitting subject for a Superbowl ad. It is against that background that we must situate our contemporary fixation on sex, gender, the body and the bodily. Art, as George Steiner has argued, is fundamentally about the experience of drawing near to a transcendent otherness looming 'through a glass darkly' behind the veil. But for the increasingly superficial denizens of our A.D.D. society, in which consciousness, at best, goes back decades rather than spanning across centuries, thesundry veils that conceal our erstwhile manifestations of transcendence have become impenetrable to us, and otherness is a bridge too far for what Lasch rightly calls a culture of narcissism. With transcendence, inherently transgressive, giving way, today, to mere transgression sans transcendence, all we can do now to experience that thrill of transgressive disclosure is, quite literally, unveil the self to others and others to the self. And in place of the intricate masks we once wore in our public and even in our private lives, in place of the layers of learning or spiritual wisdom constituting the depths of our personas at our best, we play the adolescent guessing game of sexual and gender identity: you’ll never guess, we challenge one another, behind the gender-bending clothes and ambiguous pronouns, beneath wayward trails of tattoos and piercings, what unexpected organs and scandalous preferences lie concealed. Why not, then, summon up an exhibition of pubic hair, styled even, and sugar-coated with streams of self-congratulatory words to celebrate — chaperoned by the bon motsoffashionable philosophes — our daring, depth and authenticity? Why not? Well, perhaps, if for no other reason, then because for many a casual onlooker struck dumb by disgust far deeper and more authentic than anything such a viewer might be able to glean from the banal bare bodies on display, the far right’s rousing rallying cries and the muezzins’ calls to prayer summoning the devotees of the would-be-Caliphate rising across the West will, by comparison, sound like heralds of a new Renaissance rising from the ashes of our dying culture.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUSwiZdXWxRkh	2024-10-21T16:32:35-07:00	
What Should Be Done With Obamacare? – OpEd	Regardless of who wins the election, Congress will have to deal with two important questions next year: whether to extend the Republican (Trump) tax cuts and whether to extend the Democratic 'enhanced' subsidies for Obamacare, or let them both expire. Conventional wisdom says Congress will divide on these questions almost perfectly along party lines. Could there be an alternative? How about bipartisan reform of Obamacare in a way that saves money and creates better insurance at the same time? The Case for Reform No objective observer can think that Obamacare is working the way we were promised it would. Wasteful spending: Obamacare is costing taxpayers roughly $240 billion a year. Yet we are not getting any additional health care. One study found that there has been a small uptick in doctor visits by those at the bottom of the income ladder, offset by insignificant changes for the rest of the population. Doctor visits per capita for the country as a whole have actually gone down, and visits to the emergency room haven’t changed. Medicaid expansion: The original promise of Obamacare was to insure the uninsured with private health insurance. In fact, almost all the increase in health insurance under Obamacare has been an increase in Medicaid. The small increase in the percent with private insurance is less than what we would have expected from coming out of the Great Recession alone. Junk insurance:The typical plan sold in the (Obamacare) exchange looks likeMedicaid with a high deductible. It is not accepted by many doctors and medical facilities, and if enrollees go out of network, the plans usually pay nothing. The deductibles are two to three times what we find in employer plans. Misallocation of resources:Insurance sold in the exchange undercharges the healthy and overcharges the sick. Nearly half of beneficiaries are paying a zero premium. If they are healthy, the only care they need is preventive care and that is also free. But if they have a serious health problem their out-of-pocket costs can be as high as $9,400 a year and double that for family coverage. Failure to price risk:The insurers in the exchanges get a subsidy for each enrollee, a subsidy that is unrelated to health status. Although there is some risk adjustment, it is highly imperfect—leaving the health plans with strong incentives to attract the healthy and avoid the sick. A Model for Reform There are two places in our health care system where there is an annual open enrollment, competing private health plans, federal government subsidies, and no discrimination based on health status: Medicare Advantage and the marketplace exchange. The former is highly popular, is reasonably efficient, and has attracted the enrollment of more than half of the Medicare population. The latter is dysfunctional, creates perverse incentives for buyers and sellers alike, and can prevent people with serious health problems from getting the care they need. There are three reasons for the difference. First, Medicare Advantage is the only place in the health care system where health plans receive risk-adjusted premiums that reflect the health status of the enrollees. The enrollees pay the same premium, regardless of their health condition. But the government’s additional premium payment makes the total amount the health plan receives equal to the expected cost of the enrollee’s health care. Although not perfect, it is the most sophisticated risk-adjustment system in the world. Medicare Advantage is also the only place in the health care system where a doctor who discovers a change in a patient’s health condition (say, the detection of cancer) can send that information to the insurer (in this case, Medicare) and receive a higher premium payment for the health plan, reflecting the higher expected cost of care. This means plans are rewarded, not penalized, when they find and treat medical problems. Second, Medicare Advantage is the only place in the health care system where insurance plans can specialize. There are special needs plans for diabetes, respiratory problems, heart problems, etc. This means that health plans can become centers of excellence, or what Harvard professor Regina Herzlinger calls 'focused factories.' Third, the entire Medicare program discourages 'gaming'—the practice of remaining uninsured while healthy, and enrolling only after a sickness occurs. People who delay enrollment past the point of eligibility are penalized and the longer the delay, the higher the penalty. Using the Medicare Advantage model to reform the exchanges should be an easy reform. After all, we’ve already enacted the reform for more than 30 million Medicare enrollees. Additional Reforms With the individualized risk adjustment described above, there is no reason to force everyone to purchase the same health insurance benefits. No one whose income is above the level of eligibility for Medicaid should be getting health insurance for free (paid by taxpayers). At the same time, they shouldn’t be forced to buy insurance that does not meet their financial and health care needs. They should be able to buy limited benefit insurance in the short-term market, for example, and receive a smaller subsidy from the government. What if the kind of insurance people buy doesn’t cover every eventuality—say, a million-dollar premature baby? That is where government can play a safety net role—paying for catastrophic care directly or making an exchange plan available. Here is the principle: We should let markets meet all the needs they can meet, on the theory that markets almost always do what they do better than government. If there are any remaining unmet needs, that should be the limited role for government. Among other improvements, people in the exchange should have access to a Roth-type Health Savings Account and access to 24/7 primary care from a doctor of their choice. We should also give health plans in the exchange the opportunity to reinsure the risk that some enrollees will have a very high medical expense—a reform that can cut the cost of a silver plan by almost 20 percent. If Congress is willing to set aside partisan bickering, these and other low-hanging fruit offer ways to greatly improve the current system.

Russia: Courts Convicting Record Numbers For Treason, Espionage, ...	The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation has released data on convictions during the first six months of 2024. They show that courts there sentenced record numbers of people for treason, espionage, and crimes committed by military personnel, theImportant Storiesportal says. In the first half of this year, according to the portal’s journalists, '52 people were convicted of treason, 3.5 times more than in the same period a year earlier and more than have been convicted in any whole year since 2015' (istories.media/tanews/2024/10/18/gosizmenniki-shpioni-terroristi/). Perhaps more significantly, the court figures show that during the first half of 2024, Russian courts found 6,000 Russian soldiers guilty of various crimes, three times more than in the same period in 2023 and 7.5 times more than for that period in the years preceding Putin’s expanded invasion of Ukraine. The crimes for which Russian servicemen were convicted are increasingly serious and the percentage being sentenced to prison is now 4.5 times greater than was the case in pre-war years (istories.media/en/news/2024/10/15/russian-soldiers-have-become-more-likely-to-receive-real-sentences-as-punishment/). Russian courts also sentenced more Russian civilians for terrorism and extremism during the first half of 2024. According to Important Stories, 366 were sentenced for terrorism; and 340 were convicted of extremism, both up by double digits from 2023 and even more when compared with earlier years	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUaqp4F6L4sFw	2024-10-21T16:25:28-07:00	
Israel-Iran: A Strike On Oil Assets Could Impact Oil Prices – OpE...	The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran have escalated dramatically in recent weeks, particularly following Iran's missile strikes on Israel. This conflict raises critical questions about the potential impact on global oil prices, as Iran is the key player in the energy market. The implications of a war between these two nations could reverberate throughout the world economy, affecting everything from consumer prices to geopolitical stability. The Current Situation On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a significant missile attack on Israel, marking a pivotal moment in the long-standing conflict between the two nations. This action has heightened fears of an all-out war in the Middle East, prompting immediate reactions from global markets. In the wake of these events, Brent crude oil prices surged approximately 9%, reflecting investor concerns about potential disruptions to oil supply chains. As of early October, prices had climbed to around $81 per barrel, a stark increase from previous levels. Iran's role in the global oil market cannot be understated. As one of the world's largest oil producers, Iran accounts for about 4% of global oil production, with output hovering around 2 million barrels per day. However, due to international sanctions and geopolitical tensions, its actual exports have fluctuated significantly. Following the missile attack, reports indicate that Iran has reduced its exports to approximately 600,000 barrels per day, a drastic cut that could further strain global supply if hostilities escalate. Historical Context Historically, conflicts in the Middle East have had profound effects on oil prices. Events such as the Arab Oil Embargo in 1973 and the Iranian Revolution in 1979 led to significant spikes in oil prices and widespread economic disruption. These instances serve as reminders of how geopolitical instability can impact energy markets and consumer prices globally. In this current context, analysts warn that if Israel retaliates against Iranian oil facilities or other critical infrastructure, it could lead to a substantial reduction in Iranian oil availability. Such actions could remove nearly 2 million barrels per day from the market, potentially driving prices up beyond $100 per barrel and even speculations of reaching $200 or more. Potential Scenarios The potential scenarios following an escalation of conflict are varied but concerning: Direct Attacks on Oil Infrastructure: Should Israel target Iranian oil facilities or export terminals such as Kharg Island, this could severely disrupt Iran's ability to export oil. Analysts suggest that such actions would likely lead to immediate spikes in oil prices due to fears of supply shortages. Impact on Global Supply Chains: A sustained conflict could threaten critical maritime routes like the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of the world's oil passes. Disruptions here would not only affect oil prices but also have broader implications for global trade. Market Dynamics Despite these fears, several factors may mitigate the impact on global oil prices: Increased Production Elsewhere: The U.S. and Saudi Arabia currently have significant spare production capacity that could offset any losses from Iran. The U.S., in particular, has ramped up its production levels significantly over recent years. Slowing Demand:Global demand for oil has been sluggish due to economic slowdowns in major markets like China. This reduced demand could help stabilize prices even amidst geopolitical tensions. Historical Resilience: Markets have shown resilience in past conflicts due to their ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. For instance, despite initial price spikes during conflicts, markets often find equilibrium as alternative supplies come online. Economic Implications The broader economic implications of rising oil prices due to conflict are significant: Inflationary Pressures: Higher oil prices typically translate into increased transportation and production costs across various sectors. This can lead to inflationary pressures globally, affecting everything from consumer goods to energy costs. Impact on Oil-Dependent Economies:Countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh could face severe economic challenges if oil prices surge dramatically. These nations are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on imported energy resources. Beneficiaries of High Prices:Conversely, Gulf states and U.S. oil companies would likely benefit from increased revenues due to higher oil prices. Additionally, Russia may gain financially from elevated prices as it continues its military engagements elsewhere. Impact on US Politics and elections A war between Israel and Iran would have significant implications for US politics and elections. The United States has long been a staunch ally of Israel, and any conflict involving Israel would likely draw the US into a more active role in the region. This involvement could have several political consequences: 1. Increased Military Spending: A conflict in the Middle East would likely lead to increased US military spending. This could become a contentious issue in domestic politics, with debates over budget allocations and the prioritization of military versus social spending. 2. Energy Policy Shifts: Higher oil prices could prompt a reevaluation of US energy policies. There might be increased pressure to boost domestic oil production and accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil. 3. Election Impacts: The conflict could become asignificant issue in US elections. Candidates might be judged on their foreign policy stances and their ability to manage international crises. Public opinion could sway based on perceptions of how effectively the administration handles the situation. 4. Diplomatic Challenges: The US would facediplomatic challenges in balancing its support for Israel with efforts to maintain stability in the region. This could strain relations with other Middle Eastern countries and complicate broader foreign policy objectives. 5. Public Opinion and Protests: A prolonged conflict could lead to public protests and a shift in public opinion. There might be increased scrutiny of US foreign policy and calls for a more isolationist approach to avoid entanglement in overseas conflicts. The potential for war between Israel and Iran poses a serious threat to global oil markets and economic stability. While immediate spikes in oil prices are likely due to heightened tensions and fears of supply disruptions, various mitigating factors may temper these effects over time. The interplay between geopolitical developments and market dynamics will be crucial in determining how significantly global oil prices will be impacted by this ongoing conflict. As the situation evolves, stakeholders across industries should remain vigilant and prepared for potential fluctuations in energy costs that could arise from this precarious geopolitical landscape. The ramifications of this conflict extend far beyond regional borders, influencing economies worldwide as they navigate an increasingly complex energy landscape marked by uncertainty and volatility.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUdEgazzIRWOq	2024-10-21T16:04:45-07:00	
India: HuT Ban And Containing Radicalization – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum On October 10, 2024, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) banned Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HuT), declaring it a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). According to UMHA, the group was promotingjihadand terrorist activities to undermine democratically elected governments, and to create an Islamic state and Caliphate in India and globally. UMHA also stated in the notification that HuT targets gullible youth to radicalise and motivate them to join the Islamic State (IS) and raise funds for terrorist activities. Further, the UMHA notification added that the organisation used social media platforms and secure applications, and also conductedDawahmeetings to promote its extremist ideology and terrorism. According to partial data compiled by theSouth Asian Terrorism Portal(SATP), at least 31 HuT operatives/associates have been arrested from across India in 2024 alone (data till October 20, 2024). Some of the arrests include: October 8: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested HuT operative Faizul Rahman from Chennai District in Tamil Nadu. Rahman was identified as a Nakib/ StateAmirof HuT in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and was the seventh accused to be arrested in case number RC02/2024/NIA/CHE, related to a conspiracy involving Hameed Hussain and others to spread disaffection and secessionism, and promoting the HuT ideology in India. NIA also revealed that Rahman was seeking military assistance from Pakistan to ‘liberate Kashmir’. August 30: NIA arrested a key accused, Aziz AhamedakaAziz AhmedakaJaleel Aziz Ahmed, in the Tamil Nadu HuT case involving attempts to radicalise youth and establish an Islamic Caliphate in India. Ahmed was picked up from Bengaluru International Airport in Karnataka. NIA investigations revealed that he had conducted secret Bay’ahs (oaths of loyalty), where gullible youth were committed to the HuT ideology, and sought military assistance from forces inimical to India to achieve its goal. Ahmed was found to be one of the chief initiators for the conduct of Bay’ahs. June 30: NIA arrested two operatives of HuT, identified as Abdul RehmanakaAbdul Rahman and Mujibur RehmanakaMujibur Rahman Altham Sahib, from Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu after searches at 10 locations in five Districts of Tamil Nadu. The search led to the seizure of digital devices (mobile phones, Laptop, SIM cards and memory cards) and other incriminating documents (books and printouts) containing material on HuT, Khilafa, Islamic State (IS), as well as the proposed Khilafa government and its funding structures. May 24: A team of Police personnel from the Cyber Crime Wing of the Central Crime Police arrested the ‘chief coordinator’ of HuT, Hameed Hussain (an engineering graduate), Ahmed Mansoor and his brother Abdul Rehman, from Chennai in Tamil Nadu. Police said that Hussain had been uploading videos on social media on Caliphate rule and against the democratic election process. May 25: Based on intelligence inputs, the Police launched a search at Tambaram in Chelganpattu District and north Chennai, and apprehended HuT sympathisers H. Mohamed Maurice, Kadar Nawaz SharifakaJavid and Ahmed Ali, all associated with the three men who had been previously arrested on May 24. All the six accused are natives of the Chennai District of Tamil Nadu. HuT, also known as the Party of Liberation, is a transnational Islamist movement founded by Palestinian Taqiuddin al-Nabhani al-Filastyni in 1953 in Jerusalem. It is considered an international Islamist political organisation with ideologies and affiliations with jihadist, pan-Islamist, Salafi and Sunni groups that share a common and principal objective of establishing a global Islamic Caliphate. HuT emphasises the unification of the Islamic world under a single Caliphate, rejecting all Western ideology and influence, and is strongly committed to the destruction and subversion of democracy. Nabhani drafted a proposed ‘constitution’ for the Caliphate. HuT operates in at least 32 countries worldwide across the Middle East, North Africa, North America and Europe, including the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Canada and Australia. Its headquarters are located in Lebanon and the group is banned in several countries, including Germany, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan and several Central Asian and Arab countries. Austria banned all symbols associated with the group in May 2021. On January 15, 2024, the Home Secretary of the UK, James Cleverly, placed an order before the UK Parliament to proscribe HuT under the Terrorism Act 2000, which was approved, proscribing the organisation as a terrorist group, on January 19, 2024. According to inputs, HuT has been covertly active in India since around 2010, with a strong presence in the national capital, New Delhi, mainly among students. According to HuT’s website, its ‘India chapter’ organised a demonstration in June 2010, against Israel's alleged atrocities, at Batla House, New Delhi, which was attended by about 1,000 people. However, with the arrest of two HuT operatives, Ahmed Abdul Cader and Irfan Nasir by NIA from Ramanathapuram District in Tamil Nadu and Frazer Town in Bengaluru, Karnataka, respectively, on October 7, 2020, its presence was exposed. Cader and Nasir were arrested as suspected terrorists of an IS module in Bengaluru, which was allegedly involved in radicalisation of youth and funding their travel to Syria to join the IS there. The arrests of HuT operatives have mainly been concentrated in Central and Southern Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. HuT has been involved in various conspiracies to orchestrate terrorist attacks. Significantly, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) disclosed on January 15, 2016, that the group was conspiring to carry out terrorist strikes at 23 locations across India on January 23, 2016, and, in another case, NIA lodged an FIR on June 4, 2023, in connection with the crackdown on the terror group on May 9, 2023, where 16 HuT operatives were arrested – 11 in Bhopal and Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh; and five in Hyderabad, Telangana. The FIR also mentioned that the group was planning to attack various religious leaders and places, specifically those linked to Hinduism, as well as crowded places, to create terror among 'non-believers' or those opposed to Islamic rule in India. Additionally, the FIR also added that the terrorist group was procuring a cache of arms, ammunition and explosives, to execute the attacks. Explaining the organisation's tactics after the arrest of HuT 'chief coordinator' Hameed Hussain on May 24, 2024, an NIA spokesperson observed, As an organisation, they kept their activities secret to avoid being caught, added like-minded people in their group and organised training camps clandestinely. Their preparations included training in arms-shooting and commando tactics to their group members. Their plans and tactics extended to attacks on police personnel and targeting individuals of different communities. This dangerous intent was aimed to threaten the unity, integrity, security, and sovereignty of India, with the explicit goal of striking terror among the people. Simultaneously, HuT ‘leaders’ preach and inseminate Islamist extremist campaigns and an anti-India discourse to radicalise gullible youths, through various social media outlets. In fact, HuT activities in southern India came to light with social media posts of an accused, Mohammed Iqbal, about Islamic State (IS), inciting Indian Muslims to unleash violence against Hindus. Similarly, in an NIA chargesheet filed on March 14, 2022, in the Madurai Iqbal HuT case (RC08/2021/NIA/DLI), NIA revealed that Ziyavudeen Baqavi, HuT’s ‘chief recruiter’ in Thanjavur, Madurai, Erode and Salem districts of Tamil Nadu, and the Karaikal district of Puducherry, and another accused, Bava BahrudeenakaMannai Bava, were conspiring to establish new cells in various districts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala through social media platforms such asFacebook,YouTube, etc., to recruit youth. HuT operatives also used encrypted web applications such as Rocket Chat and Threema for communication and to listen to Islamist extremist preachings. The most recent arrest of Faizul Rahman, theHuTAmirin Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, on October 8, 2024, by NIA revealed that the accused and his associates were using social media handles to spread HuT’s extremist propaganda. This was disseminated to their followers by the organisation’s ‘central media office’, through secret/encrypted communication platforms. Interestingly, HuT has infiltrated several educational and vocational institutions in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, as was discovered after the arrest of its operatives during a crackdown in May 2023. The arrested operatives included highly skilled professionals, such as a dentist, a cloud services engineer, and a pharmaceutical biotechnology lecturer. Similarly, the ‘chief coordinator’ of HuT, Hameed Hussain, holds a doctorate in Mechanical engineering. Indian Intelligence agencies in India submitted a report to and alerted the Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) under UMHA on October 8, 2024, that, with the escalation of the West Asian Crisis, there is an increasing trend of online Islamist radicalisation in India. UMHA’s decision to declare HuT a terrorist organisation is, consequently, a significant step to curb the spread of Islamist radicalisation in India and to deter potential terrorist mobilisation and attacks.

India: Widening Criminal Networks In Punjab – Analysis	By Ruchika Kakkar On October 1, 2024, police arrested two Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) operatives, Nitish KumarakaNikku Rana and Gurqirat Singh Bedi, in the Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar (Mohali) District of Punjab. They were linked to the US-based BKI terrorist Satwinder SinghakaGoldy Brar as well as associated with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in Punjab. The arrest was made in connection with the September 19, 2024, firing incident at an immigration-cum-coaching centre office in Dera Bassi, Mohali District.Earlier, on September 20, 2024, a day after the incident, three suspects involved in the incident were arrested from Dera Bassi. Two pistols and three live rounds were recovered from the suspects, who had demanded an extortion amount of INR 10 million from the owner of the immigration-cum-coaching centre, Harwinder Singh. On September 7, 2024, Police arrested Dharmpreet SinghakaDharma and Gurjant SinghakaJanta, key associates of BKI terrorist Goldy Brar, along with one pistol and five live cartridges in Amritsar District, Punjab. The arrests were linked to individuals facilitating organized crime and the possession and distribution of illegal firearms. On July 18, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Baljeet Singh, an associate of Canada-based BKI terrorist Lakhbir Singh SandhuakaLanda, in Badwani District in Madhya Pradesh. According to NIA officials, he played a pivotal role as a major weapons supplier to Landa’s agents in Punjab. On July 14, 2024, five associates of BKI terrorist Lakhbir Singh Sandhu were arrested, and three pistols were recovered from their possession, in theJalandhar District of Punjab. According to partial data compiled by theSouth Asia Terrorism Portal(SATP), a total of 39 BKI operatives/ associates have been arrested across India since the beginning of 2024 (data till October 20, 2024). In comparison, 20 BKI operatives/associates were arrested in the corresponding period of 2023. Another four BKI operatives/associates were arrested in the remaining period of 2023, taking the total to 24 through 2023. Since March 6, 2000, whenSATPstarted documenting terrorist activities in Punjab, a total of 158 BKI operatives/associates have been arrested. According toSATPdata, since the beginning of 2024, at least 33 incidents of recovery of arms and ammunition from terrorists or their associates have been reported in Punjab. 12 of these incidents were linked to BKI, two to the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF), while group identity was not confirmed in 19 incidents. BKI is a prominent Khalistan terrorist group with a long history of militancy. Its formation was catalyzed by a violent sectarian conflict between the Nirankari sect of Sikhism and members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, a devout Gursikh collective. The confrontation, which claimed the life of Akhand Kirtani Jatha leader Fauja Singh, set the stage for the creation of BKI in 1979-80, under the leadership of Sukhdev Singh Babbar and Talwinder Singh Parmar. Sukhdev Singh Babbar and Talwinder Singh Parmar were the founding members of this organisation. The organization's activities first garnered attention when leaflets surfaced following the assassination of the Nirankari sect leader Gurbachan Singh, on April 24, 1980. There are at least two known factions of BKI. The first splinter faction was formed in 1992, when Talwinder Singh Parmar, the co-founder of BKI split from the parent body and formed Babbar Khalsa Parmar. The faction has presence primarily in Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland) as well as North America. In 2017, a second faction of BKI, the Jatha Bir Khalsa, came into existence. The parent BKI has its presence in foreign countries as well. BKI formed its first overseas unit in Canada in 1979. Its presence has also been reported in the UK, Germany, France, Belgium, Norway, Switzerland, Portugal, and Pakistan. It has linkages in Thailand and Malaysia as well. Currently, Pakistan-based Wadhawa Singh is leading the parent BKI outfit. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA), through anotification dated July 1, 2020, officially designated Wadhawa Singh Babbar as a terrorist. The notificationinter aliareads, Babbar Khalsa International remained active throughout the State of Punjab during militancy era and executed several major terror attacks in and outside India and also abroad and under the patronage of Wadhawa Singh Babbar, extensively undertakes recruitment drives for terrorist activities and his preaching wings regularly organise events in order to urge people to promote terrorism and support their actions against India. BKI was involved in various terrorist attacks in India when Khalistani extremism was at its peak between the 1980s and early 1990s. Incidentally, the last major terror attack recorded in Punjab with direct links to BKI was recorded on October 13, 2007, in which seven persons, including a 10-year-old child, were killed and 40 others injured, in an explosion inside a cinema hall in Ludhiana, Punjab. As Khalistani extremism was wiped out in the early 1990s, the major Khalistani terrorist groups became dormant on the ground, within India. In recent years, however, with almost no tractions on the ground in terms of mobilizing ideologically motivated cadres, these terrorist formations, including BKI, started working with networks of gangsters which had gradually emerged within Punjab. As a result, while cadres were substantially ideologically motivated in the early years – though engagement in criminal activities, or recruitment among criminals was also significant at this stage – in recent times this movement has now become inextricably entangled in a web of criminality, engaging in extortion, targeted killings, and sinister operations with organized criminal networks coming to the forefront. The shift in its operational landscape reveals a growing gangster-terror nexus both within Punjab and abroad, raising alarm over the group’s evolving tactics and the broader implications for regional and global security. On October 11, 2024, the NIA filed a charge sheet against Wadhawa Singh Babbar and five associated terrorists, including Mandeep KumarakaMangli, Surinder KumarakaRika, and Gurpreet RamakaGora, while Harjit SinghakaLadhi and Kulveer SinghakaSidhu, each carrying a cash reward of INR I million, remain absconding. The case related to the murder of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Vikas PrabhakarakaVikas Bagga, who was shot dead in his shop in Nangal, Rupnagar District, Punjab, on April 13, 2024. The shooters, Mandeep Kumar and Surinder Kumar, were arrested on April 16, 2024. Later, on April 18, NIA arrested DharminderakaKunal, a key accused and associate of foreign-based Khalistani terrorist Harwinder KumarakaSonu. Dharminder procured the illegal arms and ammunition from Madhya Pradesh and supplied them to the shooters on the instructions of Harwinder Kumar. Meanwhile, Satinderjeet SinghakaGoldy Brar, a gangster who chose to become part of BKI, was officially sanctioned by the UMHA in January 2024. Brar is widely considered the mastermind behind the assassination of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala on May 29, 2022, in Jawaharke village, Mansa District, Punjab. In a social media post onFacebook, Brar claimed responsibility for the attack. His involvement extends to various criminal activities, including cross-border conspiracies, arms smuggling, issuing threats, and orchestrating multiple killings. Earlier, in a notification dated December 29, 2023, the UMHA declared Lakhbir SinghakaLanda, an 'individual terrorist'. According to a notification issued by UMHA, Landa was closely associated with Canada-based pro-Khalistan elements, including deceased Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar and Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, among others. Furthermore, Harvinder Singh SandhuakaRinda, is identified as a BKI terrorist operating from Pakistan. According to a gazette notification issued by UMHA, Rinda is affiliated with BKI and is currently residing in Lahore, Pakistan. He has been implicated in a variety of terrorist activities, particularly in Punjab. Previously, Rinda collaborated with Landa; however, according to disclosures by NIA, the two have since ceased their association, with Rinda now aligning himself to the US-based gangster Harpreet SinghakaHappy Passia. The September 11, 2024, incident involving the lobbing of a hand grenade (no casualty reported) at a residence of K.K. Malhotra, in Sector 10, Chandigarh, highlights the lingering threat of violence linked to BKI. Indeed, following this attack, Harpreet SinghakaHappy Passia claimed responsibility for the attack in a social media post, indicating that BKI and its affiliates maintain a well-organised criminal network with cross-border connections. This newly formed syndicate appears poised to perpetuate terrorism and other criminal enterprises within India. The rapidly growing collaboration between gangsters and Khalistani terrorists, as well as the widening networks of their international linkages, are a cause for grave concern for the Indian security establishment, as well as for the security services of the host countries where extremist and criminalized elements have consolidated their relationships on the fringes of the Sikh diaspora. While the ideology of Khalistan now finds few takers within Punjab, purely mercenary motives are enabling the deployment of violence on Indian soil. Further, criminal activities of this gangster-terrorist combine in their countries of adoption are also expanding, creating current and potential challenges for enforcement agencies there. These developments bring significant risks of disruption both in Punjab and in the countries where this criminal-terrorist nexus has established itself.

Albania’s Ex-President Ilir Meta Arrested On Corruption Charges	By Edmond Hoxhaj Ilir Meta, Albania’s president from 2017 to 2022 and now leader of the opposition Freedom Party, was arrested on Monday by order of prosecutors from the Special Anti-Corruption Structure, SPAK. Video footage posted on Instagram by Euronews Albania showed Meta putting up a struggle as he was taken from his vehicle by police officers. Tedi Blushi, Meta’s adviser, called the arrest 'a terrorist act'. BIRN has learned that Meta is accused of corruption, money laundering and non-declaration and concealment of wealth. SPAK confirmed the arrest but said more details will be released later. Investigations into Meta started last year. He was questioned in June by SPAK. Opposition Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha condemned the arrest, saying: 'Everything [being done] against him is political.' Meta was voted in as president of Albania in 2017 with the support of Edi Rama’s ruling Socialist Party. The party that Meta led at the time, the Socialist Movement for Integration, SMI, had gone into coalition with the Socialists after elections in 2013. Meta took over the party leadership in 2022 after his mandate as president finished. By then relations between the SMI and the Socialists had deteriorated and later the SMI joined the Democratic Party in opposition – with Meta remaining as head of state. The Socialists tried to dismiss Meta from the presidency twice while he was in office, once in 2019 for refusing to formally call local elections because there was an opposition boycott, and in 2021 for interfering in the general elections. A career politician who first entered parliament aged just 23, Meta has been one of the most active and controversial politicians of the last two decades. In 1999, aged 30, he became prime minister for the first time. He was re-elected PM in 2001 but stepped down in early 2002 after a falling-out with then Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano. In 2004, Meta’s wing of the party broke away from the Socialist Party to form the Socialist Movement for Integration. Though the SMI consistently trailed behind Albania’s two big parties, the Socialists and the Democrats, it repeatedly secured a slice of power by being in coalition with one or the other. Praised by some as a wily political operator, Meta and his party have faced accusations of nepotism and corruption, which he denies. Meanwhile, in an unconnected development on Sunday, SPAK ordered the arrest of Socialist MP Jurgis Cyrbja for active corruption connected to the 2021 elections, supporting crime and revealing state secrets. Cyrbja had been an MP since 2017. He resigned on October 18, a few days after he was interrogated by SPAK. SPAK said the interception of Cyrbja’s communications on encrypted app Sky ECC had led to the discovery of 'at least seven cases' in which he revealed state secrets. It added that Cyrbja had transmitted information to 'internationally wanted persons' and leaked information in order to hinder police operations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUWeC6ThUdh14	2024-10-21T15:51:36-07:00	
Bulgaria: Early Elections Won’t Solve Political Crisis	By Krassen Nikolov (EurActiv) -- Bulgarians will head to the polls on 27 October for the seventh parliamentary election in three and a half years, but there is little hope that the country's deep political crisis will end with the formation of a stable government. Polls by two leading agencies, Gallup International Balkan and Trend, show that a record low number of Bulgarians (32-38%) plan to vote and that a record number of nine political formations could enter parliament. Predictions suggest that former prime minister Boyko Borissov's GERB party, which has the support of between 25-26% of the electorate, is almost sure to win, although, with such little support, it would be very difficult for him to form a stable government, as he would need at least three political partners. 'Gallup predicts that the second place will go to the pro-European liberal coalition We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria (EPP, Renew Europe) with 16.6%, and third is the pro-Russian radical party Revival (Sovereenists) with 15.6%.' According to Trend, Revival, fuelled by disillusionment with the mainstream parties, will rise to become the country's second political force with 15.6%, and We Continue the Change - Democratic Bulgaria will come third with 15.1%. In the last parliamentary elections in the spring, Revival was the fourth political force with 13.8%. The situation is dramatic in Bulgaria's divided party of the Turkish minority, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the leading partner of ALDE and Renew Europe. The party has split into two camps, with Ahmed Dogan, the ALDE-backed founder of the party, in one, whose new coalition Alliance for Rights and Freedoms is polling between 8-9%. The other part of the MRF is controlled by the US-sanctioned Bulgarian businessman, politician and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski, who has 7% support. The pro-Russian Bulgarian Socialist Party (PES) and the populist There Is Such a People (ECR) have between 6% and 7% support. The populist parties MECH and Greatness have a chance of entering parliament with around 3%, with the electoral threshold at 4%. A pre-election Gallup poll found that 62% of Bulgarians do not believe the elections will be fair. The most serious problem in the country is vote-buying, which will become even more important given the expected low turnout.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUbJZ3tATHmkc	2024-10-21T15:48:38-07:00	
Arab News-YouGov Poll Predicts Huge Arab-American Turnout In Upco...	A YouGov poll of Arab Americans commissioned by the Arab News Research & Studies Unit suggests a massive Arab-American turnout for the upcoming US presidential election (87 percent), with Palestine being the top priority, and former President Donald Trump enjoying a 2 percentage point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris. The survey of 500 Arab Americans nationwide from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1 aligns with a poll conducted in May by the Arab American Institute that showed the Democratic Party losing support among Arab Americans due to US President Joe Biden’s handling of the Gaza conflict. His support among the community hovered at just under 20 percent at the time. During a webinar unveiling the AAI poll’s findings, its President James Zogby said Arab Americans are 'still seething over the pain of Gaza … and they’re not willing to put that away.' The battleground state of Michigan, which has a large Arab-American community, has been the focus of both Trump and Harris. According to Associated Press tracking of each campaign’s public events, Trump has held 15 events in Michigan since April, while Harris will have visited the state 11 times since she became the Democratic nominee. In a recent interview with Al Arabiya, Trump spoke of his delight at one of his grandchildren being half Arab, in reference to his daughter Tiffany marrying Lebanese Michael Boulos. The Arab News-YouGov poll shows that despite Trump being perceived as more supportive of the Israeli government than Harris, many Arab Americans would still vote for him contrary to their identification as Democrats, which suggests that they are penalizing the Biden administration over its failure to reign in Israel’s devastating military campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. When asked what is their top priority, most respondents chose the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the economy or cost of living. 'The polling figures are very telling. They show that the Las Vegas rules clearly don’t apply to our region — what happens in the Middle East clearly doesn’t stay in the Middle East,' said Arab News Editor-in-Chief Faisal J. Abbas. 'While most of us here in the Arab world might be indifferent, and don’t have a say anyway, as to which candidate ends up winning, clearly Arab voters in America feel strongly about the handling of the Gaza crisis since it erupted last Oct. 7.' The US has blocked several ceasefire motions at the UN Security Council, and has continued providing arms to Israel. Arab Americans constitute only 1 percent of US voters, but according to Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, their vote is significant this year because the race in so many states is so tight. 'The margin is 0.5 percent one way or the other, so that makes the Arab-American vote a crucial one, a crucial constituency to win.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcTelNSGNLmUUvBjkOTU-k-	2024-10-21T15:45:57-07:00	
Moldova’s Razor-Thin EU ‘Yes’ Vote Puts President Sandu In A Tigh...	By Andy Heil (RFE/RL) -- A narrow victory for the 'yes' camp in Moldova's referendum on the EU is not exactly the result that pro-EU President Maia Sandu was hoping for. By calling for the referendum, the Soviet-born and Moldovan- and U.S.-educated Sandu was hoping to capitalize onEU support and largesse,as well as political momentum from having beaten back rampant inflation in part fromenergy diversificationaway from Russia. But after a nail-biting vote count into its final minutes, Sandu and her allies snatched victory from the jaws of defeat despite consistent majority support for EU integration that hit the 63 percent mark in a poll just weeks ahead of the vote. In the simultaneous presidential election, which she was widely tipped to win, Sandu came in first. But Socialist challenger and former Prosecutor-General Alexandr Stoianoglo did better than expected, and voters catapulted him into a presidential runoff in two weeks' time with 26 percent to Sandu's 42 percent. Between Russia And The EU Both votes in this fractured former Soviet republic with ostensible EU ambitions and a shared border with Ukraine were seen as intensely geopoliticalby Moldovansand outsiders watchful for signs of anti-Western contagion and eroding unity against the Russian threat. Analyst Denis Cenusa of the Expert-Grup at Germany's University of Giessen recently called Moldova a potential 'swing state' between pro-Russian and pro-European trajectories. While the 'yes' vote in the referendum clears the way for the 'irreversibility of the European course' in Moldova, the slim margins of the win are not a strong legitimization of Sandu's EU aspirations. The tight result could potentially herald a new period of political instability and protests, with calls for recounts and allegations of fraud from both sides. This uncertainty -- and potential instability -- makes Moldova even more vulnerable to meddling from Russia, which still regards Moldova as its 'near abroad' and where it keeps hundreds of troops in the breakaway region of Transdniester. In the early hours of October 21, Sandu announced that 'criminal groups together with foreign forces' tried to 'buy 300,000 votes' -- double previous suggestions by security and law enforcement officials. Russian Meddling Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center fellow Maksim Samorukov recently warned that while Russia's 'tool kit has narrowed significantly' since it invaded Ukraine, Moldova's small size makes buying a significant portion of votes simpler than in many other would-be targets. With Moldova holding parliamentary elections next summer, the Kremlin is likely to boost those disinformation and interference operations in support of pro-Russian parties such as Stoianoglo's Party of Socialists against Sandu's liberal ruling Party of Action and Solidarity. But for Sandu, the first order of business will be the November 3 runoff against Stoianoglo, a 57-year-old from Gagauzia, an autonomous region of Moldova with pro-Russian sentiment. Some analysts have predicted Sandu won't have an easy ride and will be punished in round two for having called the referendum in such a polarized atmosphere.

Iraq Stuck Between Israel And Iran As Tensions Rise – Analysis	Iraq’s leaders have a lot on their minds, stuck between Israel and Iran as the two countries veer closer to open conflict. Iraq is still recovering from the reign of Saddam Hussein, the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, decades of sanctions that followed the 1991 invasion of Kuwait, liberation by the U.S.-led 'coalition of the willing' in 2003, a post-invasionreconstructionthat wasted much of the $60 billion spent, and the Islamic State insurgency of 2014-2019. The U.S.-ledsanctionscampaign against the Saddam Hussein regime disrupted the Iraqi economy, causing inflation to skyrocket, unemployment numbers to hit record levels, a dramatic fall in living standards, the collapse of the infrastructure, and a serious decline in the availability of public services. But it was OK, asMadeleine Albright(then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) informed Americans, 'we think the price is worth it.' All that, plus Saddam’s crimes against his own people for almost 25 years, weigh on Iraq’s as they navigate to a peaceful, prosperous future. And there are other issues to vex Baghdad. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and most Iraqis want them to leave. (In 2020, Iraq’s parliament passed a resolution demanding the expulsion of U.S. troops after the U.S. killed Iran’s Quds Force commander, Qasem Soleimani, and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.) The governments recently announced an agreement on the Americans’ departure, though the U.S. refuses to explain how many troops will remain in Iraq and what they will be doing. The story put out for public consumption is that the goal is the 'enduring defeat' of the Islamic State (IS), so will the U.S. try to declare the Islamic State is still a threat to delay withdrawing in order to support Israel against Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Iraqi militias, and bolster Washington’s clients, the Iraqi Kurds? And the Americans aren’t the only uninvited guests: Iraq hosts around300,000 refugeesand asylum seekers, mostly Syrian Kurds, and over 1 million Iraqis remain internally displaced by Islamic State insurgency. The U.S. still influences Iraq by requiring asanctions waiverfor Iraqi purchases of electricity from Iraq, and it recentlybannedall foreign transactions in Chinese Yuan. Washington still controls the disbursement of Iraq’s dollar-denominated oil revenues from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a final gesture of disrespect, the U.S. made a monthly disbursement of dollars to Iraq and at one pointrationed dollars, claiming it was necessary to prevent smuggling and money laundering, though the move immediately devalued the Iraqi Riyal. The Iran-influenced militia, the PMF, is now part of Iraq’s government, but that hasn’t stayed America’s hand when it decides to kill a PMF leader. Washington damaged itself in Iraq by killing PMF leadersAbu Mahdi al-Muhandisin 2020, andMushtaqTalibal-SaidiandMushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawariin 2024. Baghdad had moved the PMF, once a private militia, into the government in 2016 (no doubt with American encouragement), so the killing of PMF leaders, who were government officials, likely increased local support the PMF and weakened Iraqi leaders, the same leaders the U.S. then expects to stand up to Iran and purge the militias. This is about as realistic as the White House eradicating every trace of the Sinaloa Cartel from the U.S. In both countries, those groups survive, and thrive, because they have some popular support, but also because government agencies and powerful people in both countries benefit from their activities. The Pentagon produced no 'ticking bomb' rationale for the 'self-defense' attacks that it always describes as 'appropriate and proportionate,' and would have shouted it from the rooftops if there was. The Pentagon killed the PMF leaders because it could, and as a way to eliminate potential future problems in the future, ignoring the here-and-now problems it caused for Baghdad. A recentdrone attackon Israel launched from Iraq killed two Israeli troops and injured 24. Iraqis are concerned aboutIsraeli retaliation, but this is a good opportunity for the U.S. to tell Israel to stand down, and to pass information on the attackers to Baghdad so it can demonstrably clean house. Allowing Israel to strike Iraq will weaken Iraqi leaders when Washington should be doing what it can to strengthen them; standing idly by when its Israeli client attacks another country with impunity will only hurt U.S. interests. Israel is planning toattack Iranin retaliation for Iran’s retaliation to Israel’s killing its allies in Hamas and Hezbollah and Iranian military officers, the attack on itsconsulatein Damascus, Syria. And, hopefully, to slow Iran’s nuclear program. The most direct routes are through Iraq and Saudi Arabia but Iraq’sforeign ministersaid the expansion of war to Iran via Iraq’s airspace is 'unacceptable.' Washington generally has a permissive attitude to whatever Israel wants to do, so if the attackers cross Iraq the assumption will be that the Americans approved, or did not disapprove, of the attack on Iran. This will dilute support for the U.S., weaken U.S.-friendly politicians, and strengthen the hands of Moscow and Beijing, who won’t mind seeing the Americans entangled in the expansion of the Israel-Palestine civil war into a regional conflict (and Russian and Chinese oil investors in Iraq won’t mind the price spike.) Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani, visited the White House in April 2024 and his focus was the economic relationship between the U.S. and Iraq, especially because about60 per centof Iraq’s population is under the age of 25, and high youth unemployment (or under-employment) is a drag on the economy and a recruiting opportunity for Iran and the Islamists. When Americans think of Iraq in economic terms it’s all about the oil, but in November 2023ExxonMobil, America’s biggest oil company, exited Iraq with nothing to show for a decade-long effort. (PetroChina took over ExxonMobil’s role and now owns the biggest share in theWest Qurna 1 oilfield, one of the world’s biggest with estimated recoverable reserves of over 20 billion barrels.) The departure will lower the expectations of other U.S. companies, but Sudani wants to revitalize economic ties with America. Russia has investedover $19 billionin the Iraq energy sector with LUKOIL, Gazprom Neft and Rosneft the top investors. In early 2024, Gazprom, the Russian natural gas giant, was awarded the development contract for theNasiriyah oil field, which holds an estimated 4.36 billion barrels. Iraq is balancing between Russia and China to avoid becoming a client state, and American investment would increase Baghdad’s autonomy, but that’s assuming Washington doesn’t intend to do the same as Moscow and Beijing. In the absence of U.S. investment, Iraq may still be able to fund a diversified economy with oil income and that be less efficient than non-energy foreign direct investment, but Iraq has to make up for lost time since 1980, when Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Iran, and can’t afford to delay. U.S.-Iraq tradehas room for growth. In 2022, the U.S. exported $897 million in goods, the top product being automobiles. Iraq, in turn, exported $10.3 billion in goods, most of it crude oil. A key economic objective of Iraq is the $17 billionDevelopment Road, an overland road and rail link from the al-Faw port on the Persian Gulf to Europe via Turkey, that will host free-trade zones along its length. This initiative is designed to shorten travel time between Asia and Europe, potentially competing with Egypt's Suez Canal. The project is expected to enhanceIraq's geopolitical position, promote regional stability, and reduce the country's reliance on hydrocarbons by providing financial returns through increased trade. However, it faces challenges such as financing, implementation, corruption, and potential insecurity. The Development Road may benefit from connecting to other transport projects in the area: theInternational North–South Transport Corridor, the ship, rail, and road route for moving freight between India, Russia, Iran, Europe, and Central Asia; and theMiddle Corridor, an alternative to the Northern Corridor through Russia, which connects Southeast Asia and China to Europe via Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Though the projects may be complementary, they may also compete for funding so no project is fully realized and each sees only minor improvements in the host country's infrastructure. The U.S. president and the Iraqi prime minister should consider the shape of the future U.S.-Iraq relationship, which has to now been securitized, first by the Cold War, then the invasion of Kuwait and the resulting sanctions campaign, the U.S.-led invasion, and finally the Islamic State insurgency. The 2003 invasion weakened the Iraqi state and invited greater Iranian influence which the U.S. should help Baghdad dilute, though the two countries share a common religion and some tribal areas straddle the Iraq-Iran border, so Baghdad and Tehran will probably always be too close for Washington’s liking. Where Iran is concerned, in Washington, DC it’s always 1979. America’s leaders’ challenge is to understand the concept of 'sunk cost,' which means the approximately4,500 U.S. military deaths, and the $2.1 trillion spent (mostly borrowed) in a war of choice is no reason to linger in Iraq, though the 'enduring defeat' of the IS may give the project a new lease on life. Iraq is the best modern example ofThe Meddler’s Trap, 'a situation of self-entanglement, whereby a leader inadvertently creates a problem through military intervention, feels they can solve it, and values solving the new problem more because of the initial intervention. …A military intervention causes a feeling of ownership of the foreign territory, triggering the endowment effect.' The U.S. and Iraq need to move from a security relationship to an economic relationship, and for Iraq to be a full partner the Americans may have to surrender their stranglehold on Iraq’s oil revenues, which gives the U.S. outsized influence with a key member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. If Washington is reluctant to do business, Iraq can always explore joining BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), though it will have to present the organization with a rationale other than 'We have hydrocarbons,' which the current members, that include Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, have in abundance. Iraq is a member of the China-ledAsian Infrastructure Investment Bankwhich may be a source of assistance to diversify its economy and infrastructure to make it more attractive to BRICS, or it may get more attention from China if Beijing senses Washington is bedeviled by a lack of imagination. Iraq joined China's Belt and Road Initiative in 2015 and has received approximately $10.5 billion as of 2021, with investments focusing on energy projects, infrastructure development, and construction. The U.S. can help Iraq navigate its way to a prosperous future for Iraqi youth, but both countries will have to distance themselves from Jerusalem and Tehran because indulging those two often promotes self-harm instead of cooperation and opportunity.

Thank you for the recent meeting in Brussels within the framework of the Ukraine – NATO Council. It was an opportunity to establish direct dialogue with the defense ministers of allied countries, and after that, there was a strong meeting at the G7 defense ministers' level,' the President said. He noted that during a recent phone conversation with President Joe Biden, they discussed the Victory Plan, preparations for the winter period, Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, and options for bolstering them. This announcement is the Biden Administration'ssixty-eighth tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine since August 2021. This Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, which has an estimated value of $400 million, will provide Ukraine additional capabilities to meet its most urgent needs, including: munitions for rocket systems and artillery; mortar systems and rounds; armored vehicles; and anti-tank weapons. The capabilities in this announcement include: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortar systems and rounds; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M113 Armored Personnel Carriers; Satellite communication equipment; Small arms and ammunition; Grenades and training equipment; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Equipment to protect critical national infrastructure; and Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDE3v2dZmQm4T	2024-10-21T09:59:03-07:00	
Austin Visits Ukraine In Show Of US Support	U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Monday to Ukraine in a show of support for Ukraine’s military and to meet with Ukrainian leaders. The Pentagon said in a statement that Austin will also 'deliver a speech that will highlight how Ukraine has skillfully fought back against Putin's war of choice, U.S. commitment to ensuring Ukraine's armed forces have the battlefield capabilities they need, and why Ukraine's fight matters for U.S. security.' Austin’s visit comes days after the United States announced $425 million in new aid for Ukraine, including munitions for air defense systems and artillery munitions. Russian drone attacks injured at least one person in Ukraine’s capital, officials in Kyiv said Monday. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram falling debris from drones shot down by Ukrainian air defenses damaged several residential buildings. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on Telegram that as many as a dozen Russian drones were involved in the attack, but that all of them were destroyed. Russian drones also targeted Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine. Governor Vitalii Kim said Monday on Telegram that air defenses downed three drones overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Monday it destroyed 18 Ukrainian drones launched in overnight attacks. Eleven of the drones were shot down over the Rostov region, while another four were destroyed over Bryansk, two over Kursk and one over Oryol. Officials in Kursk reported there were no casualties and no damage reported from the attacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDGR71TIEldhh	2024-10-21T09:58:09-07:00	
The Impact Of The Israel-Iranian Conflict On Southeast Asia: Econ...	The escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, while primarily centred in the Middle East, carry significant economic consequences for regions beyond the immediate conflict zone. One such region is Southeast Asia, where economies are deeply interconnected through global trade, energy, and markets. Southeast Asia’s reliance on oil imports, particularly from the Middle East, renders it vulnerable to disruptions in energy supply and global price fluctuations induced by the conflict. This essay posits that the intensifying Israel-Iran conflict could substantially disrupt Southeast Asia’s economic stability through rising energy costs, inflation, slowed growth, and market volatility, thereby necessitating strategic responses and economic diversification to mitigate these risks. The Role of Middle Eastern Oil in Southeast Asia’s Economy The Middle East plays a crucial role in satisfying Southeast Asia’s growing energy demands. Nations such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam heavily rely on imported oil to fuel their industries, transportation, and overall economic growth. The region’s dependence on oil imports from the Middle East is indicative of its vulnerability to geopolitical tensions, particularly those affecting the Strait of Hormuz. This narrow passage, through which nearly 20% of the world’s oil supply is transported, serves as a vital artery for Southeast Asian economies. Historically, fluctuations in global oil prices have had a pronounced impact on the economies of Southeast Asia. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent surge in oil prices, many ASEAN countries experienced rising inflation and stagnated economic growth. These events underscore the interconnectedness between Southeast Asia’s economic health and global oil price stability. Given this dependency, any disruption in Middle Eastern oil supplies—such as a military blockade or an attack—would significantly affect Southeast Asia’s energy costs, thereby contributing to inflationary pressures throughout the region. Disruptions to Global Oil Supply and Southeast Asia’s Economic Impact The Israel-Iran conflict presents a significant threat to global oil supply chains. Both nations' engagement in cyberattacks, drone strikes, and proxy warfare has rendered crucial Middle Eastern oil infrastructure more susceptible to sabotage or military action. Iran’s persistent threats to impede access to the Strait of Hormuz exacerbate the risk of substantial supply disruptions. Any conflict-induced closure or restriction of the strait would dramatically diminish global oil shipments, precipitating immediate spikes in oil prices. For Southeast Asia, this situation would result in escalating costs across various sectors. Energy-dependent industries, including manufacturing, transportation, and logistics, would face soaring operational expenses, which could reduce output and increase consumer prices. The manufacturing sector in Southeast Asia, a pivotal component of regional economic growth, would be particularly adversely affected by rising fuel costs, thereby diminishing its competitiveness in the global market. Additionally, inflationary pressures would undermine consumer purchasing power, dampening domestic consumption and subsequently slowing GDP growth throughout the region. Broader Trade Market Implications Beyond implications for energy costs, the conflict between Israel and Iran threatens to disrupt global shipping routes, further complicating trade dynamics in Southeast Asia. The Middle East serves as a vital hub for global trade, with critical shipping lanes traversing the region. Disruptions to these routes, whether resulting from military conflict or heightened security measures, could lead to increased shipping delays and elevated transportation costs. Southeast Asia, where trade is fundamental to economic prosperity, would experience far-reaching consequences from such disruptions. Higher transportation costs would elevate the prices of imported goods, exacerbating existing inflationary pressures. Moreover, delays in the delivery of essential raw materials and products could disrupt supply chains, particularly within the electronics and automotive sectors, where Southeast Asian nations play a crucial role in global manufacturing networks. The subsequent slowdown in production could impede economic growth both regionally and globally. Furthermore, the conflict has the potential to destabilize investor confidence in Southeast Asia. As geopolitical risks in the Middle East escalate, global investors may adopt a more risk-averse posture, resulting in capital outflows from emerging markets such as Southeast Asia. This could trigger currency devaluations, increased borrowing costs, and market volatility, further complicating the region’s economic recovery efforts in the post-pandemic landscape. Economic Vulnerability of Middle Eastern Nations and External Influences While Southeast Asia's vulnerability to the Israel-Iran conflict is considerable, the economic instability within Middle Eastern oil-producing nations may also have significant repercussions for the region. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which rely heavily on oil revenues, face substantial risks if oil production is disrupted. Reduced oil exports from the Middle East would diminish government revenues, thereby undermining their capacity to maintain economic stability. This situation could consequently affect trade relationships between Southeast Asia and these oil-exporting nations, as both regions grapple with the economic fallout. Furthermore, the involvement of external powers complicates the geopolitical landscape. The United States, with its longstanding presence in the Middle East, is likely to augment its military footprint in response to escalating tensions. In contrast, China, the largest importer of Middle Eastern oil, has a vested interest in preserving stability in the region. Given China’s significant economic influence in Southeast Asia, any efforts by Beijing to mitigate the impact of the Israel-Iran conflict could substantially shape the region’s energy security and trade dynamics. Conversely, Russia stands to benefit from higher global oil prices and may leverage the situation to reinforce its energy dominance, particularly in Europe. Strategic Responses and Recommendations To mitigate the economic risks posed by the Israel-Iran conflict, Southeast Asian nations must adopt strategic responses. First and foremost, the diversification of energy sources is essential. While Southeast Asia is increasingly investing in renewable energy and alternative fuel sources, these efforts must be accelerated to reduce the region’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Enhancing regional cooperation on energy security through initiatives such as the ASEAN Power Grid could contribute to a more stable and sustainable energy future. Additionally, Southeast Asia should fortify trade partnerships with other regions to diminish its exposure to geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Expanding trade agreements with partners outside of the conflict zone, such as Australia and East Asia, would provide greater flexibility in managing supply chain disruptions. Finally, coordinated diplomatic efforts to support global initiatives aimed at de-escalating the Israel-Iran conflict could help stabilize energy markets and protect regional economic interests. Conclusion The Israel-Iran conflict represents a substantial economic challenge for Southeast Asia, with the potential to disrupt oil supplies, elevate energy costs, and undermine market stability. The region's significant reliance on Middle Eastern oil, in conjunction with its critical role in global trade, renders it particularly susceptible to the economic repercussions of this geopolitical confrontation. To safeguard their economies, Southeast Asian nations must actively pursue energy diversification, enhance trade resilience, and engage in diplomatic initiatives to mitigate the associated risks. Failure to adequately address these challenges may lead to prolonged economic instability, with extensive consequences for regional growth and prosperity.

Weak Endeavours: The Meekness Of Australia’s Anti-Corruption Body...	The warning signs of the Australian National Anti-Corruption Commission’s ineffectiveness were there from the start. The enacting legislation that brought it into existence, for instance, limit public hearings to 'exceptional circumstances', a reminder that the authorities are not exactly happy to let that large expanse of riffraff known as the public know how power functions in Australia. Then came its first major decision on June 6. Pundits were on tenterhooks. What would this body, charged with enhancing the 'integrity in the Commonwealth public sector by deterring, detecting and preventing corrupt conduct involving Commonwealth public officials' do about referrals concerning six public officials from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme? The spiritually crushing automated debt assessment and recovery program, had, after all, been responsible for using, in the words of Commission report, 'patently unreliable methodology as income averaging, without other evidence, to determine entitlement to benefit'. From its inception as a pilot program in 2015 till its conclusion in May 2020, a reign of bureaucratic terror was inflicted on vulnerable Australians. The answer from Australia’s newly minted body was one of stern indifference. While the NACC was aware of the impact of the scheme 'on individuals and the public, the seniority of the officials involved, and the need to ensure that any corruption issue is fully investigated' the commission felt that 'the conduct of the six public officials in connection with the Robodebt Scheme has already been fully explored by the Robodebt Royal Commission and extensively discussed in its final report.' In other words, there would be no consequences for the individuals in question, no public exposure of their misdeeds, no sense of satisfaction for victims of the scheme that their harms had been truly redressed. In refusing to act on the referrals, the NACC had, in the words of former NSW Supreme Court Judge Anthony Whealy KC, now chair for the Centre for Public Integrity, 'betrayed a core obligation and failed to fulfil its primary duty.' An absurd spectacle ensued. The inspector of the NACC, Gail Furness, found herself being called upon rather early in her tenure to investigate the very entity that had been created to expose maladministration and corrupt conduct after receiving 900 complaints about the NACC’s own alleged corrupt conduct. In the mess of not pursuing the Robodebt officials, it also transpired that Commissioner Paul Brereton had delegated, rather than recused himself, from the process given a conflict of interest. By merely delegating the role of reaching the final decision to a Deputy Commissioner, however, Brereton had not entirely precluded his part in the drama. Two recent incidents confirm how the NACC is intended to (mal)function – at least in the eyes of Canberra’s secrecy-drugged political establishment. Far from being effective, the body’s role is intended as impotently symbolic, an annexure of the corruption consensus that rots at the capital’s centre. The first came in the defeated efforts of Senators David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie to introduce an amendment directing the NACC Commissioner to hold public hearings if 'satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.' As Pocock explained to the Senate, the committee process into examining the NACC Act revealed 'evidence from commissioners from state integrity commissions that … there should be a presumption towards having public hearings.' The current legislation, as shaped by Labor and the Coalition, was designed 'in a way that we have no real oversight of what is happening in the NACC.' And that is exactly how that same unholy alliance hoped matters would remain, with both Labor and the Liberal-Nationals voting down the amendment. In justifying that craven move, Labor Senator and Minister for Employment and Workplace relations Murray Watt held out feebly that the 'appropriate balance' between holding public hearings, and considering whether they might 'prejudice criminal prosecution, reputations, safety, privacy, wellbeing or confidentiality' had been struck. Any attentive student of secrecy in politics will be mindful that any balance between public interests and exceptional circumstances will always favour the pathway of least transparency. In Australia, public interest tests are almost always read down to favour opacity over openness. In keeping with the disease of closed power, the second matter concerned revelations by the NACC about certain operational details regarding Operation Bannister. The investigative effort was established to investigate whether a Home Affairs employee’s 'familial links' to contracted service provider and Paladin founder Craig Thrupp, had instanced corruption. Paladin Holdings has handsomely profited from the Australian taxpayer, raking in over half a billion dollars to manage the brutal Manus Island detention centre between 2017 and 2019. The senior executive in question, pseudonymised as Anne Brown, received $194,701.10 from Paladin for 'management and consulting services' in 2017. The money was transferred to her home loan account to assist full repayment, though she denied undertaking any work for Paladin or assisting them with the tender to Home Affairs in securing the contract. Browne’s partner, retired Home Affairs executive pseudonymised as Carl Delaney, directly aided Paladin in securing the lucrative tender. He joined Paladin’s board of directors in 2019 and was remunerated to the sum of $5,000 for his efforts. Thrupp also purchased another apartment for Brown and Delaney in the same complex worth $920,000, along with accompanying furniture. Two months later, it was rented back to Paladin for $1,000 per week, though eventually sold in 2020, with Brown and Delaney pocketing the proceeds. The question being investigated was whether the failure by Brown to disclose the aforementioned events (she thought she had no obligation to do so from April 2018 when she was on long-service leave pending retirement) had affected her suitability to hold a security clearance. These included the evolving nature of her relationship with Delaney and the money and property lavished on them from Thrupp. Even Commissioner Brereton acknowledged that 'she should have at least known that at least her relationship with Delaney ought to have been reported' though inexplicably thought the non-disclosure 'understandable' and not actuated by intent, dishonesty or corruption. The investigation had initially begun as a joint investigation by the Australian Commission into Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) and the Department of Home Affairs. It then fell to the NACC from July 1, 2023 to finalise matters. On October 9, the report by Commissioner Brereton was released. The allegation that Brown had abused her office as a Home Affairs employee 'to dishonestly obtain a benefit for herself or to assist Paladin to secure the garrison services contract is unsubstantiated.' She had not failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest between herself and Thrupp ('a close relative'), and her partner Delaney, in their links to Paladin, 'in accordance with Home Affairs procedures'. The report does not find Brown’s failure to report the 'change of her circumstances to Home Affairs and AGSVA [Australian Government Security Vetting Agency]' remarkable, as it 'does not appear to have been intentional'. Failure to do so was insufficient to 'bring it to the notice of the head of the relevant agency.' For a body that offered so much promise, the NACC has failed to impress. Instead of restoring trust in the public service and politics, the Commission has shown a lack of appetite to pursue its broader remit, preferring a stymying caution. The status quo remains, distinctly, intact.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDEy0Y_-Ca0MU	2024-10-21T09:53:33-07:00	
The Danger Is Real: The Deep State’s Plot To Destabilize The Nati...	If the three-ring circus that is the looming presidential election proves anything, it is that the Deep State’s plot to destabilize the nation is working. The danger is real. Caught up in the heavily dramatized electoral showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, Americans have become oblivious to the multitude of ways in which the government is goosestepping all over our freedoms on adailybasis. Especially alarming is the extent to which those on both sides are allowing themselves to be gaslighted by both Trump and Harris about critical issues of the day, selectively choosing to hear only what they want to hear when it casts the opposition in a negative light. This is true whether you’re talking about immigration and border control, health care, national security, the nation’s endless wars, protections for free speech, or the militarization of the U.S. government. For starters, there’s the free speech double standard, what my good friend Nat Hentoff used to refer to as the 'free speech for me but not for thee' phenomenon in which the First Amendment’s protections only apply to those with whom we might agree. Despite her claims to being a champion for the rule of law, which in our case is the U.S. Constitution, Harris isn’t averse topolicing so-called 'hate' speech. In this, Harris is not unlike thoseon both the Right and the Leftwho continue to express a distaste for unregulated, free speech online, especially when it comes to speech with which they might disagree. Then there’s Trump, never a fan of free speech protections for his critics, who has been particularly vocal about his desire to see the military vanquish 'radical left lunatics,' which he has dubbed 'the enemy from within.' If it were only about muzzling free speech activities, that would be concerning enough. But Trump’s enthusiasm for using the military to target domestic enemies of the state should send off warning bells, especially coinciding as it does with the Department of Defense’s recent re-issuance ofDirective 5240.01, which empowers the military to assist law enforcement 'in situations where a confrontation between civilian law enforcement and civilian individuals or groups is reasonably anticipated.' This is what martial law looks like—a government of force that relies on the military to enforce its authority—and it’s exactly what America’s founders feared, which is why they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law: the U.S. Constitution. Responding to concerns that the military would be used for domestic policing, Congress passed thePosse Comitatus Act in 1878, which makes it a crime for the government to use the military to carry out arrests, searches, seizure of evidence and other activities normally handled by a civilian police force. The increasing militarization of the police, the use of sophisticated weaponry against Americans and the government’s increasing tendency to employ military personnel domestically have all but eviscerated historic prohibitions such as thePosse Comitatus Act. Yet sometime over the course of the past 240-plus years that constitutional republic has been transformed into a military dictatorship disguised as a democracy. Unfortunately, most Americans seem relatively untroubled by the fact that our constitutional republic is being transformed into a military dictatorship disguised as a democracy. The seeds of chaos that have been sown in recent years are all part of the Deep State’s plans to usher in martial law. Observe for yourself what has been happening right before our eyes. Domestic terrorism fueled by government entrapment schemes. Civil unrest stoked to dangerous levels by polarizing political rhetoric. A growing intolerance for dissent that challenges the government’s power grabs. Police brutality tacitly encouraged by the executive branch, conveniently overlooked by the legislatures, and granted qualified immunity by the courts. A weakening economy exacerbated by government schemes that favor none but a select few. Heightened foreign tensions and blowback due to the military industrial complex’s profit-driven quest to police and occupy the globe. This is no conspiracy theory. There’s trouble brewing, and the government is masterminding a response using the military. Just take a look at 'Megacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity,' aPentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command. The training videois only five minutes long, but it says a lot about the government’s mindset, the way its views the citizenry, and the so-called 'problems' that the government must be prepared to address in the near future through the use of martial law. Even more troubling, however, is what this military video doesn’t say about the Constitution, about the rights of the citizenry, and about the dangers of locking down the nation and using the military to address political and social problems. The training video anticipates that all hell will break loose by 2030, but the future is here ahead of schedule. We’re already witnessing a breakdown of society on virtually every front. By waging endless wars abroad, by bringing the instruments of war home, by transforming police into extensions of the military, by turning a free society into a suspect society, by treating American citizens like enemy combatants, by discouraging and criminalizing a free exchange of ideas, by making violence its calling card through SWAT team raids and militarized police, by fomenting division and strife among the citizenry, by acclimating the citizenry to the sights and sounds of war, and by generally making peaceful revolution all but impossible, the government has engineered an environment in which domestic violence is becoming almost inevitable. The danger signs are screaming out a message The government is anticipating trouble (read: civil unrest), which is code for anything that challenges the government’s authority, wealth and power. According to thePentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. government is grooming its armed forces to solve future domestic political and social problems. What they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security. The chilling five-minute training video, obtained byThe Interceptthrough a FOIA request and made availableonline, paints an ominous picture of the future—a future the military is preparing for—bedeviled by 'criminal networks,' 'substandard infrastructure,' 'religious and ethnic tensions,' 'impoverishment, slums,' 'open landfills, over-burdened sewers,' a 'growing mass of unemployed,' and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots. And then comes the kicker. Three-and-a-half minutes into thePentagon’s dystopian visionof 'a world of Robert Kaplan-esque urban hellscapes — brutal and anarchic supercities filled with gangs of youth-gone-wild, a restive underclass, criminal syndicates, and bands of malicious hackers,' the ominous voice of the narrator speaks of a need to 'drain the swamps.' Drain the swamps. Surely, we’ve heard that phrase before? Ah yes. Emblazoned on t-shirts and signs, shouted at rallies, and used as a rallying cry among Trump supporters, 'drain the swamp' became one of Donald Trump’s most-used campaign slogans. Now the government has adopted its own plans for swamp-draining, only it wants to use the military todrain the swamps of futuristic urban American citiesof 'noncombatants and engage the remaining adversaries in high intensity conflict within.' And who are these noncombatants, a military term that refers to civilians who arenotengaged in fighting? They are, according to the Pentagon, 'adversaries.' They are 'threats.' They are the 'enemy.' They are people who don’t support the government, people who live in fast-growing urban communities, people who may be less well-off economically than the government and corporate elite, people who engage in protests, people who are unemployed, people who engage in crime (in keeping with the government’s fast-growing, overly broad definition of what constitutes a crime). In other words, in the eyes of the U.S. military, noncombatants are American citizens a.k.a. domestic extremists a.k.a. enemy combatants who must be identified, targeted, detained, contained and, if necessary, eliminated. In the future imagined by the Pentagon, any walls and prisons that are built will be used to protect the societal elite—the haves—from the have-nots. If you haven’t figured it out already,we the peopleare the have-nots. Suddenly it all begins to make sense. The events of recent years: the invasive surveillance, the extremism reports, the civil unrest, the protests, the shootings, the bombings, the military exercises and active shooter drills, the color-coded alerts and threat assessments, the fusion centers, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces, the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakers. The government is systematically locking down the nation and shifting us into martial law. This is how you prepare a populace to accept a police state willingly, even gratefully. You don’t scare them by making dramatic changes. Rather, you acclimate them slowly to their prison walls. Persuade the citizenry that their prison walls are merely intended to keep them safe and danger out. Desensitize them to violence, acclimate them to a military presence in their communities, and persuade them that there is nothing they can do to alter the seemingly hopeless trajectory of the nation. Before long, no one will even notice the floundering economy, the blowback arising from military occupations abroad, the police shootings, the nation’s deteriorating infrastructure and all of the other mounting concerns. It’s happening already. The sight of police clad in body armor and gas masks, wielding semiautomatic rifles and escorting an armored vehicle through a crowded street, a scene likened to 'a military patrol through a hostile city,' no longer causes alarm among the general populace. Few seem to care about the government’s endless wars abroad that leave communities shattered, families devastated and our national security at greater risk of blowback. The Deep State’s tactics are working. We’ve allowed ourselves to be acclimated to the occasional lockdown of government buildings,Jade Helmmilitary drills in small towns so that special operations forces can get 'realistic military training' in 'hostile' territory, and Live Active Shooter Drilltraining exercises, carried out at schools, in shopping malls, and on public transit, which can and do fool law enforcement officials, students, teachers and bystanders into thinking it’s a real crisis. Still, you can’t say we weren’t warned about the government’s nefarious schemes to lock down the nation. Back in2008, an Army War Collegereport revealed that 'widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security.' The 44-page report went on to warn that potential causes for such civil unrest could include another terrorist attack, 'unforeseen economic collapse,loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters.' In 2009, reports by the Department of Homeland Security surfaced that labelledright-wing and left-wing activists and military veteransas extremists (a.k.a. terrorists) and called on the government to subject such targeted individuals to full-fledged pre-crime surveillance. Almost a decade later, after spending billions to fight terrorism, the DHS concluded that thegreater threat is not ISISbutdomestic right-wing extremism. Meanwhile, thegovernment has been amassing an arsenal of military weapons for use domesticallyand equipping and training their 'troops' for war. Even government agencies with largely administrative functions such as the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Smithsonian have been acquiring body armor, riot helmets and shields, cannon launchers and police firearms and ammunition. In fact, there are now at least120,000 armed federal agents carrying such weaponswho possess the power to arrest. Rounding out this profit-driven campaign to turn American citizens into enemy combatants (and America into a battlefield) is a technology sector that has been colluding with the government to create a Big Brother that isall-knowing, all-seeing and inescapable. It’s not just the drones,fusion centers, license plate readers, stingray devices and the NSA that you have to worry about. You’re also being tracked by theblack boxes in your cars, your cell phone, smart devices in your home, grocery loyalty cards, social media accounts, credit cards, streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, and e-book reader accounts. All of this has taken place right under our noses, funded with our taxpayer dollars and carried out in broad daylight without so much as a general outcry from the citizenry. And then you have the government’s Machiavellian schemes for unleashing all manner of dangers on an unsuspecting populace, then demanding additional powers in order to protect 'we the people' from the threats. Are you getting the picture yet? The U.S. government isn’tprotectingus from terrorism. The U.S. government iscreatingthe terror. It is, in fact, the source of the terror. Just think about it for a minute: Cyberwarfare. Terrorism. Bio-chemical attacks. The nuclear arms race. Surveillance. The drug wars. Almost every national security threat that the government has claimed greater powers in order to fight—all the while undermining the liberties of the American citizenry—has been manufactured in one way or another by the government. Did I say Machiavellian? This is downright evil. We’re not dealing with a government that exists to serve its people, protect their liberties and ensure their happiness. Rather, these are the diabolical machinations of a make-works program carried out on an epic scale whose only purpose is to keep the powers-that-be permanently (and profitably) employed. Mind you, by 'government,' I’m not referring to the highly partisan, two-party bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. I’m referring to 'government' with a capital 'G,' the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law. I’m referring to the corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country and calling the shots in Washington DC, no matter who sits in the White House. Be warned: in the future envisioned by the government, we will not be viewed as Republicans or Democrats. Rather, 'we the people' will be enemies of the state. For years, the government has been warning against thedangers of domestic terrorism, erectingsurveillance systemsto monitor its own citizens, creatingclassification systemsto label any viewpoints that challenge the status quo as extremist, andtraining law enforcement agenciesto equate anyone possessing anti-government views as a domestic terrorist. What the government failed to explain was that the domestic terrorists would be of the government’s own making, and that 'we the people' would become enemy #1. As I make clear in my bookBattlefield America: The War on the American Peopleand in its fictional counterpartThe Erik Blair Diaries,we’re already enemies of the state. It’s time to wake up and stop being deceived by Deep State propaganda.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDNHO0TwJO-yn	2024-10-21T09:51:42-07:00	
Indonesia Could Strengthen The Common Voice Of Emerging Economies...	Asian-Pacific countries are racing for the historic ascension unto BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), but Indonesia has categorically declined to broker its bid to join the association. As an association of emerging-market economies, it was established initially as RIC (Russia, India and China) almost two decades ago, in 2015, and was later enlarged with Brazil and South Africa. At the South African summit held in August 2023, the association witnessed the second wave of expansion with five more members: include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Under Russia's presidency, BRICS+ has attracted world-wide more than 30 countries with highly-potential interest which would enhance its geopolitical standing and expand its economic influence, especially in non-western markets in Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America. Most importantly, BRICS+ is leveraging its geopolitical position to influence global affairs and pursuing a more balanced and diversified foreign policy. Some experts say, Russia is capitalizing on BRICS+ for its remote goals of fighting isolation and against western hegemony. As far back as 2012, Indonesia's interest in becoming at that time the newest member of BRICS was unswerving, even with wide-ranging debates on the future and efficacy of South-South groupings. In 2012, Indonesia's development statistics made the country a shoe-in for membership: it had the largest economy in southeast Asia and was a demographic giant with a population of 248 million people, making it the fourth most populous country in the world, ahead of even Brazil and Russia. China and India were still incomparable a decade ago. In terms of South-South cooperation, and in light of a redefined system of North-South dialogue within a gradually more multipolar world, Indonesia has its place among the top categories of states influencing how transnational global world develops. Furthermore, given the country's pragmatic foreign policy practices and long-term cooperation with countries of the region and beyond, Indonesia could strengthen the common voice of emerging economies via BRICS. With the potential entrance of Indonesia, BRICS would then need to redefine, or rather refine its status as (possibly) one of the most important inter-regional groupings of countries of the Global South. Another significant issue is the investment sector, on which developing or emerging economies rely heavily. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Indonesia, and Indonesian FDI flown into other, less strong economies across southeast Asia and beyond, could be further encouraged by BRICS membership, which would facilitate better trans-regional cooperation. For instance, it could pave the way for increased South-South cooperation in Africa, with a more substantial Indonesian role in project generation and financing. In addition to China's and India's growing presence and involvement in the African continent, Indonesia could play (a bigger role), particularly if we (acknowledge) the growing amount of official development assistance (ODA) emerging economies have granted Africa. Its domestic market is huge and the current economic boom can be attributed to its political stability and sound economic and monetary policies, which have attracted consistent FDI. In short, Indonesia is an economic power to be (reckoned) with and its decision to join the BRICS could have a huge impact in terms of the body's credibility. Indonesian membership will definitely solidify BRICS capital composition, and also bring on board extraordinary fiscal capability. On the one hand, Russia is set to re-emerge as a strong global power with a dominant role in central and western Asia, along with India and China. But India needs to sort out its internal rifts and neighbourhood problems first, while China is becoming a strong force to reckon with in Asia, Africa and Europe. China is definitely the (primary) growth-engine of Asia and is stepping up its influence in the global economy to match its ambitions. Indonesia, on the other hand, is more comfortably clustered with South Africa and Brazil as a regional power and an economic anchor-country for the southeast Asian region, but lesser on a wider global scale. Another possibility is the re-emergence of a politically stronger ASEAN, now that Burma (Myanmar) is opening up to its neighbours. In this context, the MIST countries – Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand – will become more relevant, if they can overcome their internal problems and play the regional integration card. On the eve of the Kazan's BRICS Summit, a new report said that Indonesia would likely decided on joining BRICS only in the next government term. According to the report, Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi announced that the decision regarding the country's potential membership in the BRICS economic bloc would be made during the next government term under President-elect Prabowo Subianto. 'The decision will be made by the next government, but we will continue to provide inputs on BRICS to the President-elect,' Marsudi stated during a working meeting with the House of Representatives at the parliament complex, News.Az reports citing foreign media. Marsudi said she had spoken to Prabowo about BRICS shortly after being announced as the winner of the 2024 Presidential Election. 'Not long after the President-elect was determined, I had the opportunity to talk with Mr. Prabowo, and I briefed him about BRICS,' she remarked. She explained that Indonesia's visibility to become a member of BRICS depends on the economic benefits that can be derived from joining the alliance. 'Because BRICS is an organization for economic purposes. Therefore, we will try to see from the economic side first whether the benefits are there so we can decide (on whether) to join BRICS,' the foreign minister explained. An interesting new term is currently used to describe BRICS, referring to it as forming part of global majority. Some say its simply non-western association whose majority members are located in the Global South. Collectively, BRICS association already incorporates some 45% of the world population, while its trade turnover and share in the global economy has been growing steadily. South Africa Summit reports indicated that Indonesia was given an invitation to join BRICS during the 15th BRICS Summit held in Johannesburg, South Africa, on August 22-24, 2023. Geographically located in Southeast Asia and Oceania, between the Indian and Pacific oceans, Indonesia is classified as a newly industrialized country, with its economy the world's 16th-largest by nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is considered a middle power in global affairs. In addition, Indonesia is a member of several multilateral organizations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8, APEC, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDA_iMPSw8ApS	2024-10-21T09:49:58-07:00	
Indonesia’s Assertive Foreign Policy Under Prabowo: Balancing Reg...	Under the leadership of Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia's foreign policy is anticipated to experience a more assertive shift in response to the evolving dynamics within Southeast Asia and the broader geopolitical landscape. Historically, Indonesia has adhered to an independent and active (bebas-aktif) foreign policy, characterised by non-alignment and active participation in multilateral diplomacy. However, the increasing complexity of regional disputes, the intensifying rivalry between the United States and China, and Prabowo's defence-focused background suggest a potential departure from Indonesia’s traditionally cautious approach. This emerging strategy may result in Indonesia adopting a more proactive role within regional security frameworks, modernising its military capabilities, and leveraging its strategic geopolitical position to foster global partnerships. While this shift presents promising opportunities, it also introduces challenges related to balancing regional leadership, defence posture, and global engagement. In the context of Prabowo's likely foreign policy, a primary focus will be the establishment of Indonesia as a regional leader within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As Southeast Asia grapples with rising tensions in the South China Sea and broader security issues, Indonesia's leadership could play a pivotal role in shaping regional security frameworks. Prabowo may advocate for a more robust ASEAN that transcends consensus-based decision-making, aiming to create a more decisive body capable of addressing external threats. His previous experience as defence minister could inspire Indonesia to promote stronger military collaboration within ASEAN, including joint exercises and enhanced disaster relief capabilities, particularly in areas vulnerable to external aggression. Indonesia’s approach to the South China Sea may also become more assertive. Although it has previously avoided confrontation, Prabowo's administration might adopt a firmer stance on defending its maritime claims in the Natuna Islands. Expanding naval capabilities and increasing patrols in contested areas may signify Indonesia's determination to assert its claims, potentially positioning it as a mediator in disputes among ASEAN members and external powers. An essential component of Prabowo's foreign policy will also involve the strengthening of Indonesia's defence posture. Southeast Asian nations, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand, have been modernising their military forces in response to regional threats, and Indonesia is likely to pursue a similar path. Prabowo's defence-oriented background suggests a significant emphasis on enhancing Indonesia’s military through investments in advanced technologies, including fighter jets, naval vessels, and missile defence systems. Modernising the navy and air force is critical to securing Indonesia's extensive maritime territory, particularly in light of its strategic location along major shipping routes. However, Indonesia's military modernisation will not be confined to conventional threats. Increased investments in cybersecurity and counterterrorism initiatives will be essential to address challenges posed by non-state actors. With the rise of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure in the region, Indonesia’s security apparatus is likely to prioritise the enhancement of its digital defence systems and the strengthening of collaboration with international partners for intelligence sharing. Additionally, fortifying capabilities to counter-terrorism, particularly in regions susceptible to radicalism and piracy, will complement these broader defence efforts. Indonesia's assertive foreign policy is expected to extend beyond regional concerns, with global engagement emerging as a central focus. The intensification of the US-China rivalry presents Indonesia with opportunities to leverage its non-aligned stance for strategic advantage. As the United States seeks to consolidate alliances in Asia to counterbalance China’s influence, Indonesia could assume a pivotal role in managing relations with both nations. The administration under Prabowo may pursue stronger defence ties with the United States, potentially securing military aid and participating in joint military exercises while concurrently fostering robust economic and trade relations with China. This diplomatic balancing act could enhance Indonesia’s geopolitical significance and facilitate negotiations for favourable terms in defence procurement, technology transfer, and infrastructure development. In addition to bilateral engagements, Indonesia may aspire to position itself as a mediator in managing regional disputes arising from US-China tensions. Such a role could elevate its diplomatic profile and strengthen its status as a strategic power broker in Southeast Asia. However, global engagement will not be limited to interactions with great powers. Prabowo’s administration could seek to deepen strategic partnerships with other significant global players, including Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. Cultivating closer economic ties with these nations will be crucial for diversifying Indonesia’s partnerships, reducing dependency on China and the United States, and attracting foreign direct investment in critical industries such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and defence. While Prabowo’s assertive foreign policy presents considerable opportunities for Indonesia, it also poses challenges. Increased military spending may exert pressure on the nation’s budget, particularly if economic growth decelerates. Moreover, balancing Indonesia’s assertive stance in the South China Sea with its leadership role in ASEAN may prove complex, given that other member states might adopt varying approaches to managing relations with China. Overextending military ambitions, in conjunction with Indonesia’s traditional non-aligned position, may risk alienating key partners. Additionally, navigating global pressures will necessitate careful diplomacy to avoid becoming ensnared in the broader US-China conflict. In conclusion, Indonesia's assertive foreign policy under Prabowo Subianto is poised to significantly reshape its regional and global engagement strategies. By emphasizing the enhancement of regional leadership, defence modernisation, and the establishment of global partnerships, Prabowo's administration holds the potential to elevate Indonesia's standing within Southeast Asia and the broader international community. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of this policy will be contingent upon Indonesia's ability to reconcile its ambitions with the economic and diplomatic constraints it encounters. To adeptly navigate these challenges, Indonesia must prioritise regional cooperation within the ASEAN framework while concurrently bolstering its defence capabilities. Moreover, a careful and strategic diplomatic balancing act among global powers will be crucial for ensuring Indonesia's strategic autonomy and fostering sustainable growth.

NATO’s Indo-Pacific Expansion Lacks Legality And Common Sense – O...	South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand sent their defence ministers to a NATO meeting in October 2024. While their heads of state and others have attended before, this was the first time these countries’defenceministers joined. This more military-operative attendance signals that NATO is serious about its expansion into this region. From a politico-psychological angle, it also shows that expansion for the sake of expansion has become theraison d’êtreof the once-defensive alliance. NATO has been searching for such a reason to exist ever since the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact dissolved about 35 years ago, and, by all logic, it ought to have been closed down, too. The expansion happens in violation of NATO’s Treaty of 1949. That Treaty is a copy of the UN Charter, refers disputes to the UN and states (Art 5) thatmembersof the alliance are obliged to support any member should it be attacked from the outside. Today, NATO has 32members,but—incrementally and virtually without international attention—it has added 38partnercountries worldwide, including the four above-mentioned. The category 'partner' does not exist in NATO’s Treaty – neither, by the way, do things like nuclear weapons and first-use of them, interventions or bombings in non-member states like Yugoslavia at the time, Kosovo, Libya, Ukraine, etc. These activities have no legal basis in NATO’s Treaty; they areout-of-areaandout-of-treaty operations. One common sense and legal question arises: How far can an organisation deviate from its legal foundation without being investigated for possible illegal conduct – and which institution has the authority to investigate? Here is how NATO motivates its creeping expansion on its homepage: 'To enhance (their) mutual situational awareness of security developments in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, including Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies in various domains, the deepening strategic partnership between the PRC and Russia, and the security situation on the Korean Peninsula… 'Partnership network strengthens security outside NATO territory, which makes NATO itself safer.' Regrettably, NATO’s homepage does not contain any rational, empirically solid, multi-dimensional analysis that substantiates that China is a threat or 'challenge' to NATO’s members. The alliance today runs on postulates and outdatedoffensivedeterrence and defence thinking. China is a problem because it has different values and interests. It sounds increasingly like sermons to a church congregation. According to a June 2023 report by the US Congressional Research Service about US infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific, 'the United States maintains and uses at least 66 significant defense sites spread across the region.' (China has one military base worldwide in Djibouti). In addition, the costs of Western permanent – increasing – naval presence and the tremendous costs of AUKUS, the trilateral partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have increased. AUKUS Pillar 1 is about Australia acquiring nuclear-powered attack submarines and hosting such submarines from the US and UK. Pillar 2 is about intensified collaboration in these high-tech areas: undersea capabilities, quantum technologies, AI and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities and electronic warfare. But the costs of upholding a worldwide militarist empire are unimaginably high and self-destructive: US military expenditures are US $ 916 bn (at least, lots of items are not in the Pentagon budget) = 3.4% of its GDP. It is roughly as large as the next 9 top-ranking countriescombined:China US$ 296 bn/1,7% of GDP, Russia 130/6.3%, India 84/2.4%, Saudi Arabia 76/7.1%, UK 75/2.3%, Germany 67/1.5%, Ukraine 65/37%, France 61/2.1% and Japan 50/1.2% – all according to SIPRI, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Given these facts and the fact that it is the US that builds up tension against China and not the other way around – nobody threatens the West! – it is impossible to find any empirically solid reason for the US/NATO postulate that China is a threat or 'challenge.' It seems, rather, to be pathological – a psycho-political paranoia growing out of a) the subconscious but denied sense of relative decline and b) the permanent need for enemies to legitimise the existence of the out-of-democratic control MIMAC – Military-Industrial-Media-Academic Complex that the US has or, rather,is. Macro historical studies of empire decline point to causes such as over-militarisation, shrinking legitimacy in the eyes of others, decline on all other power dimensions but the military and – of special importance – over-extension: the empire grows beyond management/control with a declining economic carrying capacity. Since the US/NATO has already lost in more than one way in Ukraine (and all wars since Vietnam), the US may leave it (to the Europeans) and engage in yet another futile war in the Middle East – and then try to 'pivot' to Taiwan/China. But by then, the Empire and NATO will have dissolved – like its Western brother, the Soviet Union – due to self-destructive, delusional policies and emotionalism devoid of vision, rational foreign policies and diplomacy. That is – overextension, militarism and hubris. And that’s when we can hope to create a much better, peaceful and cooperative world. Remember, over the rainbow, skies are still blue. So too in the Indo-Pacific.

Killing Of Innocents By Terrorists In J&K Must End – OpEd	Coming within 48 hours of Omar Abdullah taking oath as Chief Minister of J&K union territory, it’s obvious that Friday’s targeted killing of a 30-year-old migrant labourer by terrorists in the Shopian district of South Kashmir wasn’t coincidental. This dastardly murder was clearly meant to buttress Pakistan's jaundiced view that despite large voter turnout and peaceful conduct of assembly elections in J&K, normalcy still eludes this region. Though personal details other than name of the victim are unavailable, the fact that thevictim had left his home in faraway Bihar and had come to Kashmir in search of an honest living to support his family indicates that he was indeed a very needy person. It would also be fair to assume that being an outsider preoccupied with work, he neither had the time nor inclination to delve into local politics or engage in ideological issues plaguing Kashmir. It’s thus evident that this unfortunate migrant worker was brutally killed,not for anything he had said or done, but only because he happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Besides demonstrating the complete disregard that terrorists have for human life, killing of an innocent person also completely belies claims made by Pakistan and its local proxies that such killings by ‘mujahideen’ [Islamic warriors] have religious sanction as they are part of the ongoing ‘jihad’ [holy war] in J&K. Since Islam preaches that 'the murder of one innocent person is akin to the murder of the whole of humanity,' aren’t those involved in the killing of innocents and calling themselves ‘mujahideen’ actually apostates? Similarly, aren’t those decreeing that such heinous killings are admissible in ‘jihad’ intentionally misrepresenting Islam, and are hence guilty of blasphemy? These are some pressing issues that should concern both the clergy and civil society in Kashmir. The long history of violence orchestrated by Pakistan army’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI] in J&K has adequately exposed how low Rawalpindi can stoop in order to further its own self-serving interests. More than thirty years ago it beguiled gullible Kashmiri youth to become cannon fodder in its proxy war aimed at bleeding India through ‘a thousand cuts’ by creating the illusion that an ‘armed struggle’ would get them ‘azadi’ [freedom]. However, within no time, ISI’s unilaterally changed the goalpost by altering the very objective of the so-called ‘armed struggle’ from ‘azadi’ to merger with Pakistan. Separatist leaders who opposed Pakistan’s interference [like All Jammu and Kashmir Awami Action Committee chairman Mirwaiz Mohammad Farook and Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front [JKLF] ideologue Prof Abdul Ahad Wani] were murdered, while others meekly accepted this barefaced subjugation of the Kashmiri people by Pakistan. JKLF, which initially spearheaded the so-called 'armed struggle' in J&K espoused ‘azadi’, but this objective went against Rawalpindi’s vested interests. So, ISI created a new terrorist group called Hizbul Mujahideen [HM] to propagate Kashmir's merger with Pakistan. The HM quickly decimated JKLF in a bloody turf war, andJKLF’s Pakistan based co-founder Amanullah Khan’s revelation that HM had killed more JKLF cadres than Indian security forces gives a fair idea of the humongous scale of bloodshed. On the political front, ISI orchestrated creation of All Parties Hurriyat Conference [APHC], an amalgam of separatist groups that served as its faithful minion. Consequently, the 'azadi' call gave way to the 'Kashmir banega Pakistan' [Kashmir will become part of Pakistan] slogan. The unfortunate part was that both APHC leaders and terrorist commanders who vociferously voiced their non-negotiable stand on the ‘right to self determination’ suddenly turned into staunch advocates of Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan. So, while the people of Kashmir were forced into accepting subservience toPakistan, separatist and terrorist leaders responsible for fulfillingISI's demand were suitably rewarded. The wanton violence that erupted in the early nineties turned the paradise on earth into veritable hell soaked in the blood of innocent Kashmiri men, women and children. To prevent its bluff being called out, Rawalpindi cunningly played the religion card that saw the emergence of a new question-cum-answer slogan-'Pakistan se hamara rishta kya? La illaha illallah' [What is the relation of Kashmiris with Pakistan? There’s no other God but Allah]. Islamisation of the so-called ‘Kashmir struggle’ in J&K has opened doors to religious fundamentalism. Readers would recall that in 2017, HM commander Zakir Musa had declared that 'We are fighting for 'Azadi baraye Islam [freedom for the sake of Islam].' Announcing that 'My blood will spill for Islam and not for a secular state,'he threatened to behead APHC leaders if they continued referring to the Kashmir issue as being'political in nature' and not an 'Islamic struggle.' Musa’s leaving HM and joining Al Qaida affiliate Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind [AGuH] indicates the dangers of religious radicalisation. Despite having threatened to behead APHC leaders, the crowd that turned up for his funeral was as big as what one saw during the funeral of HM poster boy Burhan Wani. Theextraordinary public popularity for the AGuH chief espousing Al Qaida's skewed Quranic interpretations is indeed something that should have worried the intelligentsia and civil society in Kashmir, but there are no such indications. Even before one could overcome the shock of Friday’s cold blooded murder of a migrant worker in Shopian, terrorists struck once again on Sunday. Shooting indiscriminately at a group of labourers working on a tunnel project in Gund area of South Kashmir’s Ganderbal district when they were returning to their camp after completing the day’s work, the terrorists killed one local doctor and six immigrant workers while seriously injured five others. It seems that Pakistan army’s proxy war has either dulled sensitivities of the Kashmiri people towards unprovoked violence in J&K or forced them to become mute onlookers. The ongoing trend of civilians having no connection whatsoever with the Kashmir issue being murdered just to keep Rawalpindi in good humour by keeping thepot boiling in Kashmir, can easily spiral out of control and adversely impact the fragile peace that’s slowly returning in Kashmir. This can’t be allowed to happen. So, it’s time people of Kashmir demand that the killers tell them the compelling reasons for committing such unpardonable acts of extreme brutality against innocent civilians thatbrazenly violate Islamic teachings? Most importantly, it’s time Kashmiris became more discerning and by displaying assertiveness, reject Pakistani interference and take control of things themselves. They need to understand that killing innocent civilians in J&K solely serves Rawalpindi's perverse intentions, which is vitiating the peaceful environment in Kashmir and making life for locals. This must end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-rZSb4E0aDCmdSelTbTQK	2024-10-21T09:44:32-07:00	
Zelensky’s So-Called ‘Victory Plan’ In A New Bottle – OpEd	Victory can still win the war so the US and the West need to send additional military aid and loosen the restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons in its possession.' In nutshell is the so-called Zelensky's self-proclaimed 'Victory Plan,' in a New Bottle repeatedly put across to Ukraine’s allies. The world knows who can win. The Russians have the advantage. Putin has a larger Army with a more war waging capability and resources. However, all of this doesn't necessarily guarantee Victory —what the Russian army has in materiel advantages, it lacks in the quality of motivational command to lead with a cause. Having said that Russia's tactical gains over the last few months have left no option to Victory but to withdraw further west. The facts on the ground, include a slow but steady Russian advance with the Ukrainian army suffering high attrition rates. Zelensky knows all of this, and so is this Zelensky's self-proclaimed 'Victory Plan,' which the Ukrainian president has been preaching and boasting of dependent on the US-NATO ally’s support! The hard truth is that the US or the West does not see anything original or innovative in it. The 'Victory Plan' is less a 'Plan' and more a continuation of Zelensky's lobbying campaign to keep US and the Western arms flowing in. Zelenskyy has presented his so-called victory plan to the Ukrainian parliament, President Biden and EU leaders aimed at seeking a just peace to the war with Russia thanks to aid and guarantees from its allies. Zelensky now talks of 'Peace' more frequently than ever. Zelensky's interpretation of a peace process is through his so-called 'Victory Plan' is that 'If we start now and follow the Victory Plan, we can end this war no later than next year.' Zelensky’s Five Point Plan in brief: Invitation to join NATO Even though actual membership is still an issue for the future, an invitation to join would send a strong signal to Russian President Putin. Member countries have committed to Kyiv’s 'irreversible' path to membership but haven't issued an actual invitation. However, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte reiterated that Russia had no role in deciding if Ukraine should be in NATO. More Weapons with No Restrictions on their Use Ukraine’s request at ending all restrictions on the use of donated weapons to strike inside Russia and help from allies in shooting down missiles and drones over Ukrainian territory. For the Western fears of crossing Kremlin red lines Zelensky argued that Ukraine's advance into Russia's Kursk region shows that Putin doesn't have enough strength. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has cautioned 'If the decision to lift restrictions is really taken, that will mean that from that moment NATO countries will be conducting direct war with Russia a nuclear power.' Deterrence Ukraine proposes to deploy on its soil a comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package that will be sufficient to protect Ukraine from any military threat from Russia. Strategic economic potential Ukraine proposes partners from the EU and US sign a special agreement on common use of Ukraine’s critical resources, like lithium, gas, titanium and others, and produce energy together in the future. Post-war perspectives Ukraine would bolster European security with its battle-hardened military by replacing certain military contingents of the US armed forces stationed in Europe. A Very Ambitious Plan: Some of the Ukrainian MPs felt it was a very ambitious plan. 'The plan looks like others need to do everything for us.' 'On one hand, the plan sounds like a fantasy. On the other hand, Patriot, Storm Shadow, and F-16s used to sinking of a large part of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and the control of a piece of Kursk. Everything depends on the decisions of partners and the success of our diplomacy.' Lozynskyisaid. However, he added that Zelenskyy 'did not explain how he plans to achieve the implementation of these points.' UN Warns of Transfer of Weapons to Ukraine-Russia High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said on 13 September 2024,that the provision of military assistance and transfer of arms and ammunition to the Ukrainian armed forces have continuedin the context of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in violation of the UN Charter and of international law. Shipments reportedly included such heavy conventional weapons as tanks, armoured combat vehicles and aircraft, helicopters, large-caliber artillery and missile systems and uncrewed combat aerial vehicles alongside remotely operated munitions, small arms and light weapons and their ammunition. She also pointed to reports of States transferring, or planning to transfer, weapons such as uncrewed aerial vehicles, ballistic missiles and ammunition to the Russian armed forces and that these weapons have been used and are likely to be used in Ukraine. But, No one is listening to the UN or on Disarmament issues. Zelensky now repeatedly emphasizes Kyiv’s readiness to negotiate an 'End to the War.' The Victory Plan is based on US-NATO Western allies of their military assistance. ‘Victory’ towards ‘Peace’ has to be on your own strengths and not depend totally on Western support. Zelensky in an interview has hinted at one overreaching message: 'Ukraine is fighting a war not only with Western backing but on behalf of the West. The idea is to ensure that Ukraine gets iron-clad security guarantees from its allies and is well armed to prevent Russia to attack again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcrwnY-vSR2CkMiEAHD5Qpt	2024-10-21T09:43:16-07:00	
Young People Do Not Want A Future With Looming Threat Of Antimicr...	Who would we ever want to deal with infections that are difficult (or impossible) to treat! Young people are right when they call on world leaders to ensure a future where antimicrobial resistance is no longer a threat to global health security and food security. 'When I was a pharmacy student, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) used to be an abstract concept to me. I was taught about AMR and how to identify it by using drug susceptibility test, and how to look at the resistance pattern among other parts of our curriculum. But when I started working as a pharmacist, I saw more and more patients who were dealing with microbes resistant to medicines. AMR was no longer something I learnt about in school but a major challenge I need to deal with because patients rely on us to tell them what medications they can take. When we look at tests, then often we realise that they may have one or two options left of medicines that can respond (as they could be resistant to all other medicines for the disease they have),' said Dr Audrey Wong, Chairperson of Quadripartite Working Group for Young Engagement on AMR. Quadripartite is a historic alliance comprising four global agencies that have come together to address AMR: global UN agency on human health (World Health Organization – WHO), global UN agency on food and agriculture (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations – FAO), global UN agency on the environment (United Nations Environment Programme – UNEP), and World Organisation for Animal Health – WOAH. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is among the top 10 global health threats today. It is associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths annually, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. AMR affects human health, animal health, plants and also our environment. Without a stronger response to prevent AMR, there would be an estimated average loss of 1.8 years of life expectancy globally by 2035. Financially, AMR would cost the world US$ 412 billion a year in additional healthcare costs and US$ 443 billion per year in lost workforce productivity. In addition to causing deaths, which are projected to increase to 10 million a year by 2050, other expected impacts of AMR include increased morbidity due to infectious diseases, longer hospital stays, escalation of health expenditure, a fall in agricultural productivity (when food security worldwide is already threatened by the dire consequences of the climate crisis) and poor animal health and welfare, exacerbating animal suffering and loss. Dr Audrey Wong was speaking with CNS (Citizen News Service, a founding member of Global AMR Media Alliance or GAMA) on the sidelines of the historic second-ever United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AMR. A political declaration was endorsed by heads of nations which is many shades stronger than the one adopted 8 years ago at a similar meet. AMR affects our animals too We at CNS also spoke with Karina Khatic, a final year Veterinary student from Trinidad and Tobago who currently serves as a trustee member of the International Veterinary Students' Association which focuses on all aspects of veterinary medicine, including One Health. She is also a part of the Quadripartite Working Group for Youth Engagement on AMR. 'We are so proud to get space to share our voices on AMR [at the UNGA HLM on AMR and other such spaces] and how AMR affects us and risks our present and future. We will continue to call for a change till the AMR threat looms,' said Karina. 'I am a veterinarian, and I work with animals of so many species. AMR can also affect our animals. It is important to remember that AMR does not just affect human beings but also animals. So, we the veterinarians and others involved in animal health and livestock need to be aware and do what-we-can-do (and what we know works) to reduce misuse and overuse of medicines in our sector,' said Karina. She added: 'AMR is a challenge not limited to one sector like human health, but its threat is looming over many other sectors, such as animal health and livestock, food and agriculture, and our environment. We need to engage and work collaboratively with many other sectors to prevent AMR with One Health approach - that is key.' Misuse and overuse of medicines is rampant in human health, animal health and livestock, food and agriculture, and reaches our environment too. That is why One Health approach remains the bedrock to advance progress towards effective prevention of AMR. 'There needs to be more awareness. The accessibility to medicines is far from ideal in my country,' Karina said. Unless ALL people have access to timely and accurate diagnostics (for all diseases, infectious and non-communicable diseases alike), and linkage to standard treatment, care and support, how can we avert AMR? In addition, standard infection control practices in all healthcare settings, communities and homes and universal access to vaccines for vaccination-preventable diseases is key. We must keep disease prevention in a people-centred and rights-based gender transformative manner as mainstay. Agrees Karina: 'We need people-centred responses to AMR. This includes people-centred communications around AMR because we do not have to engage only medical professionals but a range of other sectors and communities.' Agrees Dr Audrey too: 'A lot of times AMR may seem like a big and complex thing for a lot of people, but in fact it is not. AMR can affect anyone! There is a lot what a person can do at an individual level to reduce the risk of AMR: like washing hands and maintaining sanitation and hygiene, getting vaccinated, preparing food safely, among others', says Dr Audrey. Youth manifesto Dr Audrey mentions an important youth-led organising earlier this year which led to the launch of a youth manifesto in lead up to this high-level meet of world leaders on AMR. The preamble of youth manifesto called for: - Meaningful youth engagement in policy, advocacy and programme implementation to achieve integration into local and national AMR action plans. - Fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration to establish capacity-building initiatives and mentorship programmes to enable youth-led actions against AMR at national, regional and global levels. - Encouraging countries and key stakeholders, such as civil society organisations and institutions, to address the AMR priorities and to include youth in co-creating their strategic plans on AMR. - Ensuring One Health approach remains the bedrock for advancing progress to combating AM Social media and AMR Social media campaigns have been very impactful in getting more attention to AMR. AMR, which is often looked as a very medicalised issue, fails to connect with non-medical people. The response to stopping misuse and overuse of medicines has to be rooted in the communities - and communications of which has to take diversity of the communities in account. 'AMR is like a very medical term and it can be really hard to understand and to relate to for a lot of people,' said Dr Audrey Wong. 'That is why we use diverse approaches to reach out to people- for videos we used TikTok, we used story books, among other tools. We also tried to put spotlight via our story book that links malaria with AMR.' AMR survivors breathe life to 'AMR is invisible. I am not' A powerful and potentially game-changing campaign: AMR is invisible. I am not' has helped humanise the AMR epidemic - which continues to take lives as well as increase human suffering. Audrey believes that even individuals can take their own small steps to help mitigate the threat of AMR. Along with it, we must push for stronger national action plans to reduce and prevent the AMR threat. 'It is always about what we all can do (to prevent AMR).' Promises made by world leaders at UNGA HLM on AMR 2024 World leaders at the 79th United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AMR adopted a political declaration which has concrete targets. Some of these promises include: * Reducing the global deaths associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance by 10% by 2030 against the 2019 baseline of 4.95 million deaths * 100% countries having basic water, sanitation, hygiene and waste services in all healthcare facilities and 90% of countries meeting all WHO minimum requirements for infection prevention and control programmes at the national level by 2030 * At least 80% of countries can test resistance in all bacterial and fungal pathogens included in the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) by 2030 * Ensure, by 2030, that all countries have developed or updated and are implementing multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance with national targets informed by analysis of existing capacities and priorities * Strive to meaningfully reduce, by 2030, the quantity of antimicrobials used globally in the agrifood system from the current level.

Who Is Responsible For Obstructions In The UNHRC, Geneva? – OpEd	Tamil activists have participated in the UN human rights process since July 1983 - activists from the South since 1990. Then, only twice a year - the UN Human Rights Commission in March followed by the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights in August. But when Kofi Annan was UN Secretary-General, in 2006, the UN Human Rights Council – UNHRC was established in place of the Commission with various changes. Meanwhile, the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights was named the 'Advisory Committee'. Even though, since 1983, Tamil activists presented injustices committed against the people in the North and East to the members of the UN Human Rights Commission and the Sub-Commission, these institutions never considered the massacres, disappearances, arrests, torture, economic destruction were an important issue in the eyes of the UN. Soon after massive disappearances in the South in 1988-1990, a few politicians from the South attended the Human Rights Commission in the early 1990s. Following Mullivaikaal, since 2012, nine resolutions have been passed consecutively on Sri Lanka in the UNHRC. The first resolution in May 2009 was initiated by Sri Lanka for their benefit, exactly a week after the atrocities in Mullivaikkal. Even though many pogroms were carried out against Tamils on the island from the 1950s, with the support of the ruling governments – it was only after 1977 that the authorities appointed investigative committees and commissions. This was to eye-wash the international community. Failed commissions None of the investigations found justice for the victims. Here are a few examples of failed Commissions and Inquiries: (1) Sansoni Commission – 9 November 1977, Report published 2 July 1980. (2) Report of Presidential Truth Commission on Racial Violence (1981-84), published. (3) France M. S. April (MSF) Report of inquiry into Palambiti-Ranai road attack on vehicle released 9 May 1991. (4) Kokkaticholi Commission of Inquiry appointed 18 June 1991, report released 9 March 1992. (5) 1991-93 Presidential commissions, involuntary arrests of victims from their residences by unknown persons. Report not published. (6) President D.P. Commission appointed by Wijetunga on 13 September 1993. Report not published. (7) 1994 Commission of Inquiry on Disappeared Persons, appointed 30 November 1994. Report published September 1997. (8) Batalanda Commission, December 1995. (9) 1998 All Sri Lanka Commission on Disappeared Persons appointed 30 April 1998, report March 2001 Issued. (10) Presidential Truth Commission on Ethnicity – Appointed 23 July 2001, report released September 2002. (11) Bintunuwewa Commission – to investigate the killing of 28 Tamil youths between the ages of 14 and 23. Appointed March 2001 and report issued. (12) International Committee on Independence of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) - Appointed November 2006. Report not issued. The international community will know that its international members were humiliated by the then government of Sri Lanka. Resolutions passed The following numbers of countries cast their vote in favour of Sri Lanka during the UNHRC resolutions: 2009 2012 2013 2014 2015 2017 2019 2021 2022 22* 15 13 12 (No voting) 11 07 *The resolution passed on 26 May 2009 was in favour of Sri Lanka, with the support of India. According to some UN diplomats, 'This was a fraudulent move by Sri Lanka in the UNHRC'. At that time, Sri Lanka and India falsely promised member countries that, as the communiqué of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there would be an investigation into everything that took place in Mullivaikkal. This caused 22 member countries to cast their votes in favour of Sri Lanka. However, it is worth noting that over 25 countries out of 47 members did not favour this resolution. Some of them neither participated nor abstained from voting - some were not even present in the session. After many years of heavy lobbying by Tamil activists in the UNHRC, the international community came forward to look into the accusation of genocide, crimes against humanity, and human rights abuses of people in the North East. However, some unknown and incomprehensible obstacles began to centre on the UNHRC. Although Tamil activists have been acting with facts and working with dedication, UN diplomats' value information from international human rights organisations more than from Tamil organisations and victims. Who are they? Apart from our observations, some diplomats alerted us, and lately, we felt that we were unable to move anything forward in the UNHRC for unknown reasons. Now, more than fifteen years have passed, and the victims have found no justice. When some member countries wanted to take some initiative to find justice for the victims, they found that unknown sources had created some hidden obstacles. It's a mystery. This prompts me to share certain information regarding the dilemma in the UNHRC. Since 2000, especially in 2002, following the ceasefire between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - LTTE and the Sri Lankan government, some people from an important Western country raised their heads as a group, in deciding the fate of the victims. This group operates from a country where whichever political party comes into office implements what they pre-planned concerning Sri Lanka. They are not only from the West; there are also a few Sri Lankans. Those days, some of these individuals visited Sri Lanka and went to war-torn Vanni. Also, they are very close to some important politicians and popular NGO activists in Sri Lanka. These people are very close with some Tamil diaspora and with locals, gathering information for their distorting task. They are known as members of civil society, but from which NGO is questionable. If you observe this group, some come to Geneva in the morning and return in the evening, while others visit Geneva depending on their agenda, especially to brainwash Tamil activists. Even though they are not seen much in the UNHRC, they closely watch everything concerning Sri Lanka. It is not possible to know their roots. But, it has been revealed that they have already done many subversive tasks in Sri Lanka! Mystery While all the UN Human Rights Commissioners and stakeholders have issued many important statements and reports, this group's continuous interference has suppressed every effort in the UNHRC, causing more disappointment to the victims. These mysterious individuals do not work with any international human rights organisations, but they seem to control their activities regarding Sri Lanka. Due to this group's arbitrary move, Resolution 51/1 passed in 2022, which was supposed to be developed into a strong resolution in the 57th session, has gone to the dogs. No valid reason was given, and the period for formulating a specific resolution was prolonged until September 2025 – the 60thsession of the UNHRC. Now the question is, who are these people - for whom are they working? It seems that they are not bothered about the history of Sri Lanka/Tamils or the root cause of the conflict in Sri Lanka. British Tamils No matter who it is, nothing can be achieved by ignoring these unknown individuals in the UNHRC. Tamil is the oldest language in the world, and it has thousands of proverbs/expressions that convey a long message in two lines. For example: in Tamil 'நம்ப நட, நம்பி நடப்பதே', in English, 'Allow others to trust you, but don't trust others'. Another Tamil proverb says, 'நீண்ட நாள் திருடன் ஒரு நாள் அகப்படுவான்'. In English: 'Long-time thieves will be caught one day'. This is the present situation concerning Sri Lanka in the UNHRC. However, there are three countries very well aware of the political aspirations of the people in the North and East. They were the colonial rulers of Sri Lanka: Portugal, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. During the rule of Portugal and the Netherlands, the Tamils remained in their separate kingdom in their homeland, the North East. After these two, during British rule, the Tamil Kingdom remained separate until 1833. Unfortunately, the British amalgamated the Tamil Kingdom with the other two kingdoms in 1833, marking the beginning of the conflict in Sri Lanka. President of France Therefore, the Tamil diaspora in the United Kingdom must remind the British of their mistake and duty. This is the way to safeguard the Tamil nation in Sri Lanka. The Tamils in the UK maintain good relationships with the government in power, with Labour and the Conservatives. I hope the world has heard by now that French President Emmanuel Macron's greeting message to the President of Sri Lanka was in Tamil. The reason is obvious. During Chandrika's presidency, she used all her French political influence to work against the Tamil activists in France. However, this didn't work in her favour, as France is for neutrality. Therefore, the British Tamil diaspora has a huge responsibility and obligation to motivate the British government and the people to understand the grievances of the Tamils caused by the British.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcrwnY-vSR2ClsnRWG5shN0	2024-10-21T09:40:06-07:00	
Global Powers And The Israeli-Lebanese Conflict: A Call For Coord...	The Israeli-Lebanese conflict, particularly the escalating hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, has reached a critical juncture in recent months. The violence, exacerbated by Israel’s extensive aerial bombardments of Hezbollah positions in Lebanon and attacks on United Nations peacekeepers, poses a substantial threat not only to the fragile political stability of Lebanon but also to the broader geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. This situation necessitates urgent and more assertive intervention from the international community. Major global powers, including the United States, Russia, and China, must adopt a resolute approach to enforce international law, exert diplomatic pressure, and mitigate further escalation. This essay analyzes how these powers may influence the trajectory of the conflict and emphasizes the necessity of coordinated involvement to achieve enduring peace in the region. Israel’s recent military operations, specifically the intensified airstrikes targeting Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, have resulted in considerable civilian casualties and extensive damage to Lebanese infrastructure. The violence has led to the displacement of communities, disruption of livelihoods, and exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis in a nation already experiencing economic collapse. Israel’s military actions have raised serious concerns regarding violations of international legal standards, particularly following an attack that injured several UN peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon to promote regional security and prevent hostilities. This escalation has provoked international condemnation; regrettably, global initiatives to address the crisis have been, at best, tepid. The United States, a long-standing ally of Israel, has exhibited notable ambivalence in its response to the ongoing hostilities. While the United States continues to provide political and military support to Israel, it has been reticent to unequivocally denounce actions that contravene international law, including assaults on UN peacekeepers. This inconsistency undermines the United States’ credibility as a mediator and peace facilitator in the Middle East. The U.S. must adopt a more transparent and assertive position. By exerting diplomatic and economic pressure on Israel to adhere to international law—particularly regarding the protection of peacekeeping personnel—the United States could assume a pivotal role in de-escalating the conflict. Should Israel persist in its disregard for international standards, the U.S. should advocate for sanctions or even contemplate initiating Israel’s suspension from certain United Nations entities, thereby signalling that noncompliance will have serious repercussions.In contrast to the United States, Russia and China exert significant influence over Hezbollah's primary supporter, Iran, and possess the capacity to shape the dynamics of the conflict from an alternative perspective. Both Moscow and Beijing maintain strategic relationships with Tehran, which has robust connections to Hezbollah, thereby providing financial and military assistance. Russia and China have vested interests in promoting regional stability to safeguard their geopolitical and economic priorities in the Middle East. Consequently, they are positioned to apply pressure on Iran to moderate Hezbollah's actions and pursue diplomatic resolutions rather than military confrontations. By leveraging their influence, Russia and China could facilitate a ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and Israel, which is a critical step toward broader peace negotiations. A collaborative effort involving the United States, Russia, and China is essential for establishing a balanced approach to the conflict. Each of these global powers possesses the capacity to bring their respective allies—Israel and Hezbollah—to the negotiating table. Although their interests may diverge, a common emphasis on reducing regional instability could encourage cooperation. Furthermore, such collaboration could help ensure that neither side dominates the peace process, which is vital for achieving a sustainable resolution. This balanced approach would not only mitigate the immediate crisis but also lay the groundwork for long-term stability in Lebanon and the broader Middle East. International law must be central to efforts aimed at resolving the conflict. Israel's attacks on UN peacekeepers contravene international agreements, including protocols governing the protection of peacekeeping forces. The United Nations must undertake decisive action by investigating these violations and holding all parties accountable, including Hezbollah for its provocations. If Israel persists in breaching international norms, stronger enforcement mechanisms, such as sanctions or suspension from key international bodies, should be considered. These measures would underscore the importance of compliance with international law and delineate the consequences of defiance. The path to peace in Lebanon is fraught with challenges; however, coordinated international pressure, particularly from the United States, Russia, and China, could prove pivotal. The United States must move beyond its ambivalence and spearhead initiatives to hold Israel accountable for aligning its actions with international law. Concurrently, Russia and China should diplomatically engage with Iran and Hezbollah, offering incentives for the cessation of hostilities and participation in peacebuilding efforts. In conclusion, the Israeli-Lebanese conflict constitutes a significant flashpoint within the Middle East, necessitating immediate international attention. The failure of the United States, Russia, and China to synchronize their diplomatic efforts has exacerbated the situation as hostilities continue to escalate. Moving forward requires a comprehensive and coordinated response from the international community, which should hold violators of international law accountable and promote diplomatic resolutions. A balanced approach that underscores the importance of peace and regional stability is essential to mitigating the risk of a broader conflict. Global powers must seize this moment to avert further bloodshed and work collaboratively toward a sustainable resolution in Lebanon.

Mahdi, Tawid, And A Hot Hot Planet – OpEd	Humanity has thrown the global water cycle off balance 'for the first time in human history,' fueling agrowing water disasterthat will wreak havoc on economies, food production and lives. The water cycle refers to the complex system by which water moves around Planet Earth. Decades of destructive land use and water mismanagement have collided with thehuman-caused climate crisisto put 'unprecedented stress' on the global water cycle, said a report published in mid October 2024 by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water. The water crisis threatens more than 50% of global food production, and risks shaving an average of 8% off countries' GDPs by 2050, with much higher losses of up to 15% projected in low-income countries. Ex-president Donald Trump has pledged to dismantle the Biden administration's 'green new scam' in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. He vowed to boost production of fossil fuels; oil, natural gas and coal, and repeal key parts of the Biden 2022 climate law. During his first term in office, Trump dismantled much of the groundwork laid by his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump rolled back nearly 100 different environmental rules and regulations on air pollution, carbon emissions and toxic substances. When voters go to the polls on 5 November, they'll likely be locking in four years of vastly different climate change policy. Don't forget the summer 2024 was Planet Earth's hottest on record. Phoenix climbed over a scorching 110 degrees on 80 days in 2024 -- shattering last year's record of 55 days of temperatures over 110 degrees. But even more dangerous is that scientists using ice-breaking ships and underwater robots have foundthe Thwaites Glacierin Antarctica is melting at an accelerating rate and could be on an irreversible path to collapse, spellingcatastrophefor globalsea level rise. Thwaites holds enough water to increase sea levels by more than 2 feet and its collapse could ultimately lead to an 8-10 feet of sea level rise, devastating coastal communities from Miami and London to Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands. New heat records come amid 13 months in a row of record-breaking temperatures on Earth; not just over land,but in the oceans too. Before 2023, the record highest temperature was 16.8 °C, set in August 2016. Since mid-2023, the planet has broken that 2016 threshold 58 times. Jews and Muslims must concentrate on the challenges facing our world. Both Islam and Judaism teach their followers to take care of the earth. Muslims and Jews also believe that humans should act as guardians and trustees (stewardshipand khalifah) off our planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. If humans will not reduce man made carbon magnification, not even the coming of Mahdi and Messiahs may be able to overcome human unwillingness to reverse human pollution. God demands that humans fulfill their God given responsibilities. The total economic losses caused by natural disasters hit an estimated $72 billion in the first half of 2022, fueled by storms and floods, Swiss reinsurance giant Swiss Re estimated. And according to a 2020 Oxfam report, the richest 10% of the global population produce half of the Earth's fossil-fuel emissions, while the poorest half contribute a mere 10%. And for the first time in two decades, there are now more closed autocracies than liberal democracies in the world according to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-Dem Institute) at the University of Gothenburg. The democratic melting decline has taken place globally, and an increasing number of people are living in closed autocracies. The level ofdemocracyenjoyed by the average world citizen in 2022 is back to 1986 levels. This means that 72 percent of the world's population, 5.7 billion people, now live under authoritarian rule. Liberal democracies do not automatically overcome autocracies. Democracies must be supported and defended. Like Judaism and Christianity, Islam has a powerful eschatological strand. Islam anticipates the end to the world as we know it, a final historical confrontation between the forces of good and evil; after which human life will be transformed in a positive way. Many Islamic traditions (Ahadith) say that Prophet Jesus, will return and will join forces with the Islamic messiah, the Mahdi, in a battle against a false messiah, the cruel one eyed Dajjal, called Armilos in Jewish tradition. Now would be a good time for one or more Messianic figures to get to work. What does the Muslim Mahdi do? Shortly before the Day of Judgment, when commanded by God, al-Mahdi will return to lead the forces of righteousness against the forces of evil in an apocalyptic war that would ultimately establish peace and justice on earth, according to Shia believers. 'He will fill the earth with equity and justice, and will rule for seven years.' (Abu Dawud) How does the Jewish Messiah fit in with this? Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) But Prophet Zechariah also envisions a future time when God helps humans establish worldwide peace. All the nations in the world then may travel to Makkah and Jerusalem to worship God in peace. It is important for Muslims to realize that during this prophesied future Hajj Sukkot, the future city of Jerusalem (without a physically rebuilt Temple) will welcome both Jews and non-Jews, just as it did in the days when Prophet David (before King Solomon built the Temple) wrote in his Zabur: 'I rejoiced with those who said to me, 'Let us go up to the house of the LORD...There the (12) tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, as it was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 122:1-4) Orthodox Jews still pray for the ancient Temple to be rebuilt. But the more numerous Reform Jews stopped doing that two centuries ago. The place is holy; not the building, think the great majority of Jews today who are not Orthodox Jews. And Prophet Zechariah even includes those who were previously Israel's enemies: 'Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem, will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate Hajj Sukkot.' (Zechariah 14:16) Just as the Kaa'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). But a Muslim shrine, called The Dome of the Rock, as well as a mosque, the Masjid al-Aqsa, stand on the Temple Mount presently. The Dome of the Rock is regarded by Muslims as the third holiest site in the world. Any attempt to replace it or the Masjid al-Aqsa would provoke Muslims to a war of cataclysmic proportions. But a three dimensional virtual reality Jewish broadcast station could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock some 650 feet away from the Masjid al-Aqsa provided Muslims would cooperate. As a Reform Rabbi who believes that the world wide upheavals we see are part of the birth pains of the Messianic Age, I offer Christians and Muslims some more positive insights from the Jewish Prophets and the Rabbinic Sages. Many millions of Jews, Christians and Muslims believe the wars of GogandMagog(Gogu-Magog in Hebrew and 'Yajuj and Majuj' in Arabic) which started in the 18th to 20th centuries will come to an end in the 21st century. It is true that human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last 250 years than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations are exploding in Africa and populations are declining in Europe. Technology produces both worldwide prosperity and worldwide pollution at the same time. Should we look upon the future with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation?Is the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday? Or are both occurring almost concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Jews, whose Biblical prophets were the ones who first wrote about a future Messianic Age, recognize that the birth of a Messianic Age must be preceded by its birth-pangs. But the prophets of Israel also emphasize the glories of a future world living in peace and prosperity with justice for all. Ancient Jewish prophecies did proclaim that there would be an end to the world as we know it.But they did not prophesy that the world will come to an end, nor did the Prophets of Israel offer an exact date for the transition. The exact advent of the Messianic Age is not knowable because humans have free will and thus the exact time and manner of redemption cannot be determined in advance. Much depends on what we humans do. The beginning of the Messianic Age is a time of transition from one World Age into another. How we move through this transition, either with resistance or acceptance, will determine whether the transformation will happen through cataclysmic changes or by a gradual reform of human society; which will lead to a world filled with peace, prosperity and spiritual tranquility. The Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the Jewish community.This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah.The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves have helped bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come about through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps and most obvious of all climate change which will affect both nature and the economy-society. The Messiah (Mahdi) refers to one or more human agents of God who help bring about a non-destruction positive transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (together with several forerunners and many disciples) will be a human being, a descendant of Prophets Abraham and David, with great qualities of national leadership similar to Prophets Moses and Mohammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Islamic 1400s we are now living in, is the age of the coming of Hazrat Mahdi. Prophet Jesus will also return to Earth in this century. As Prophet Micah states: 'In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; and exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. 'The Torah will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken. All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we (Jews, Christians and Muslims) will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.' (Prophet Micah 4:1-5) One of the signs of the End of Days is the arrival and defeat of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj or Ajuj and Majuj). Gog and Magog appear in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Quran as individuals, tribes, countries and catastrophic acts of nature. The Quran mentions Gog and Magog twice: 'He said: 'This (barrier) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the warning of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to dust (and Gog and Magog—the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists would be released into the world); and the promise of my Lord is true.' (18:98) So Gog and Magog are destructive groups like the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists, who near the time of the end of days will penetrate into every part of the world. The other mention of Gog and Magog in the Quran is: 'But there is a ban on a town which We have destroyed: that they (the people of the town) shall not return (to reclaim that town as their own); until Gog and Magog are let through (the barrier), and swiftly spread out in every direction.' (21:95-96) This verse refers to Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, and only reclaimed 18 centuries later as Israel's capital, following the era of the defeat of the Nazis, the Communists, and the Colonialist Empires, who had been Gog and Magog for generations. Thus, humanity has so far passed through the most devastating era of human history. However, we have not yet reached the goal of the Messianic Age when 'They (all nations) will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken.' (Prophet Micah 4:2-4) As the Qur'an states: ''Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearest to being God-fearing.' (5:8) This era will come when Israelis and Palestinians make a long lasting two state partnership of peace; thus fulfilling the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.On thatdayIsrael will joina three-party alliance with Egyptand Assyria,a blessing uponthe heart.The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'... (Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcrwnY-vSR2Cpg1RqszP0yr	2024-10-21T09:36:57-07:00	
Strengthening Democracy And Justice: The Role Of Constitutional C...	The establishment of constitutional courts represents a significant advancement in the legal and political landscape of any nation. These specialized judicial bodies are tasked with interpreting and upholding the Constitution, thereby ensuring that the rule of law prevails, citizens' rights are protected, and democracy is nurtured. In countries like Germany, Russia, Italy, France, and the United States, constitutional courts play a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of power among branches of government and safeguarding individual freedoms. Pakistan's journey since its independence in 1947 has been marked by political upheaval and inconsistent democratic governance. The judiciary, while a critical player in maintaining the rule of law, has often faced challenges related to independence and effectiveness. The demand for constitutional courts stems from the need for a dedicated mechanism to address constitutional issues and protect the rights of citizens. Pakistan's Constitution, adopted in 1973, enshrines fundamental rights and delineates the structure of government. However, the lack of a specialized body to interpret and enforce these provisions has led to instances of executive overreach and legislative impropriety. The establishment of constitutional courts could provide a solution by offering a forum dedicated solely to constitutional matters. The establishment of constitutional courts specifically designed to handle constitutional issues could address these challenges effectively. These courts would focus on interpreting and enforcing the Constitution, ensuring that the rule of law prevails, and protecting citizens’ rights. By dedicating resources and expertise to constitutional law, Pakistan can enhance its judicial performance and create a more reliable legal framework. Constitutional courts can serve as guardians of democracy by ensuring that all laws and governmental actions comply with the Constitution. By providing a venue for the adjudication of constitutional issues, these courts can check legislative and executive overreach, thereby reinforcing the balance of power among institutions. In recent years, political polarization has severely undermined democratic processes in Pakistan. Constitutional courts can act as impartial arbiters in political disputes, helping to resolve contentious issues such as electoral disputes and the legality of government actions. This could restore faith in democratic institutions and processes, enabling citizens to participate in governance with confidence. A robust constitutional court system would ensure that the rule of law is upheld in Pakistan. By interpreting constitutional provisions consistently, these courts can provide clear guidelines for the application of laws, reducing ambiguity and arbitrariness. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their status or position, are held accountable under the law. Moreover, by establishing precedents in constitutional interpretation, these courts can create a framework that helps lower courts and legal practitioners navigate complex constitutional issues. This not only enhances the quality of judicial decisions but also fosters a culture of legal predictability, essential for promoting business, investment, and overall societal stability. One of the most critical roles of constitutional courts would be to protect citizens' fundamental rights. Pakistan's Constitution enshrines various rights, including freedom of speech, assembly, and religion. However, the enforcement of these rights has often been inconsistent, leading to widespread violations and public disillusionment. Constitutional courts can provide a dedicated platform for individuals to challenge violations of their rights. By adjudicating cases involving human rights abuses, these courts would not only offer remedies to victims but also deter future violations by holding perpetrators accountable. This could significantly improve the overall human rights landscape in Pakistan, promoting a more just and equitable society. In addition to protecting civil liberties, constitutional courts can address broader socioeconomic rights, such as the right to education, health, and social security. By interpreting these rights within the constitutional framework, these courts can compel the state to fulfill its obligations toward marginalized and disadvantaged groups. This focus on socioeconomic rights could also lead to more equitable policies and resource allocation, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations receive the support they need. As a result, constitutional courts could play a transformative role in fostering social justice and reducing disparities in Pakistan. Pakistan's political landscape has often been marred by conflicts between various institutions, such as the executive, legislature, and judiciary. These disputes not only hinder effective governance but also erode public confidence in institutions. Constitutional courts can serve as mediators in these conflicts, providing authoritative interpretations of constitutional provisions that delineate the powers and responsibilities of different branches of government. By clarifying jurisdictional boundaries, constitutional courts can prevent encroachment by one institution into the domain of another. This would enhance cooperation among institutions and promote a culture of mutual respect, essential for a functional democracy. In addition to resolving disputes, constitutional courts can promote accountability among institutions by adjudicating cases related to abuses of power. By holding institutions accountable for their actions, these courts can deter corruption and malfeasance, reinforcing the public's trust in governance. Moreover, the establishment of constitutional courts can encourage institutions to adopt more transparent practices, as they will be aware that their actions can be scrutinized by an independent judiciary. This could foster a culture of accountability and integrity within Pakistan's political and administrative systems. One of the most significant advantages of constitutional courts is their potential to establish consistent legal precedents. By providing authoritative interpretations of constitutional provisions, these courts can create a body of jurisprudence that guides lower courts and legal practitioners in future cases. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that similar cases are treated similarly, fostering fairness and justice in the legal system. Drawing inspiration from the experiences of constitutional courts in countries like Germany, the United States, Italy, France, and Russia, Pakistan can create a framework that not only safeguards fundamental rights but also promotes accountability and civic engagement. However, realizing this vision will require overcoming significant challenges, including ensuring judicial independence, raising public awareness, and building the capacity of the judiciary. As Pakistan continues its journey toward a more democratic and just society, the establishment of constitutional courts can serve as a beacon of hope, ensuring that the rights of citizens are protected, and the rule of law prevails. In a nation where political turmoil has often overshadowed the aspirations of its people, constitutional courts can provide the necessary foundation for a brighter future built on justice, equality, and democratic governance. Furthermore, constitutional courts can play a vital role in protecting fundamental rights, addressing socioeconomic disparities, and promoting accountability among institutions. By fostering a culture of legal predictability and clarity, they can enhance public trust in the judiciary and democratic institutions. As Pakistan navigates its complex political landscape, the introduction of constitutional courts could mark a significant turning point. By prioritizing constitutionalism and the rule of law, Pakistan can move towards a more just, equitable, and democratic society, where the rights and freedoms of every citizen are upheld and protected.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3WTUo6Khsq2P	2024-10-21T09:33:02-07:00	
Building A Lasting Peace Between Azerbaijan And Armenia – OpEd	The prospect of peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been a long and challenging journey, but there is cautious optimism as both sides inch closer to a formal peace agreement. After years of conflict, over 80% of the peace treaty draft has already been agreed upon, a remarkable achievement considering the deep divisions that have defined relations between the two countries for decades. Yet, the unresolved issues that remain are of paramount importance, particularly the presence of Armenia’s territorial claims against Azerbaijan enshrined in its constitution and legal documents. Azerbaijan has made it clear that peace cannot be built on unstable ground. As long as Armenia maintains legal provisions that imply territorial ambitions over Azerbaijan, true peace remains elusive. It is not just a matter of signing a document; Azerbaijan insists that for any agreement to be genuine, Armenia must commit to revising or removing these claims from its constitution. Without such a move, peace would be fragile, merely a pause in hostilities rather than a sustainable resolution. Baku’s position is not one of obstinacy, but of prudence. Azerbaijan seeks not a temporary ceasefire but a durable and comprehensive peace that will ensure long-term stability in the South Caucasus. The recent history of the region, marred by violence, occupation, and immense suffering, underscores the necessity for a peace that addresses the root causes of the conflict. Azerbaijan cannot afford to settle for a peace that leaves fundamental issues unresolved. The hurdles to peace are not confined to legal texts. Another significant obstacle is Armenia’s ongoing militarization. Over the past year, Armenia has accelerated its military buildup, raising concerns not only in Azerbaijan but across the region. For a country that has engaged in decades of aggressive foreign policy and maintains territorial claims against a neighboring state, this intensification of armament is deeply troubling. The question must be asked: What is the purpose of such military expansion if the goal is genuine peace? The situation is further exacerbated by a well-coordinated defamation campaign led by certain Armenian and pro-Armenian groups on the international stage. This campaign seeks to undermine Azerbaijan’s standing globally, casting a shadow over its peace efforts and tarnishing its image. These efforts, while unsuccessful in derailing Azerbaijan’s path to development and stability, nonetheless create an atmosphere of mistrust that complicates the peace process. For peace to flourish, such negative external influences must be curtailed. Complicating matters further is the role of external powers with vested interests in the South Caucasus. These geopolitical actors often view the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia as an opportunity to exert influence in the region, prioritizing their strategic goals over the well-being of local populations. In many cases, these powers have adopted a stance that disproportionately favors Armenia, emboldening its leadership to take less constructive positions in the peace negotiations. For sustainable peace to be achieved, it is essential that external actors prioritize the long-term stability of the region over their short-term geopolitical ambitions. Despite these challenges, there is a foundation for optimism. The peace process is advancing, and both Azerbaijan and Armenia have a clear interest in reaching an agreement. The conflict that once defined the region has, in large part, been resolved, and new geopolitical realities have emerged in the aftermath of the Second Karabakh War. These realities include an enhanced role for Azerbaijan in regional economic and transport networks, particularly through projects like the Zangezur corridor, which promises to transform regional trade and connectivity. Another encouraging sign is the progress made in the delimitation and demarcation of borders, which had long been a contentious issue. The ongoing negotiations on this matter are a testament to the fact that both sides are willing to engage in practical dialogue on difficult issues. This willingness to work through the complexities of border demarcation offers hope that a broader peace agreement can be reached. The Path to Sustainable Peace To ensure that peace is not only signed but sustained, it is critical that Armenia demonstrates a greater commitment to constructive engagement in the negotiations. This includes halting its military buildup and refraining from international campaigns aimed at isolating or undermining Azerbaijan. Peace requires mutual respect, trust, and a genuine willingness to compromise. Azerbaijan, for its part, has shown extraordinary patience and a readiness to move beyond the past. Despite enduring 30 years of occupation, with its associated human, material, and emotional costs, Azerbaijan continues to extend a hand of peace. This commitment to peace reflects not just a desire to resolve bilateral issues with Armenia but a broader vision for the South Caucasus region. Azerbaijan is invested in creating a future where the region can thrive economically, politically, and culturally. This vision requires peace, stability, and cooperation between all its neighbors, including Armenia. The peace process is therefore not just about ending a conflict but about building a new era of collaboration and shared prosperity. In conclusion, the time for peace has come. While significant challenges remain, the progress made thus far gives reason for cautious optimism. For the region to truly move forward, both Armenia and Azerbaijan must embrace the opportunities before them. Armenia, in particular, must take bold steps towards genuine reconciliation by removing its territorial claims and engaging in a more constructive and peaceful dialogue. Only then can the South Caucasus achieve the lasting peace and stability it so desperately needs. Azerbaijan, as always, remains ready to walk the path of peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3V62ZFRs2unL	2024-10-21T09:31:11-07:00	
Exposing Fake Allegations Of ISKP Operating From Pakistan – OpEd	New accusations by the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IAG) that the Islamic State in Khorasan province (ISKP) is based in Pakistan have fuelled much attention and concern from Islamabad. Such statements which seem to shift focus from Afghanistan’s own problems more specifically the TTP presence in Afghan soil can be seen as questionable motives and legitimacy in the IAG. ISKP creation is traced back to Afghanistan not as Pakistan’s creation as many people tend to believe. Despite IS’s retreat in 2014 from SV checkpoints in northern Iraq for which it had been fighting since 2011, the group and its Pakistani affiliate, the TTP, began collaborating with ISKP formally in 2015, and ISKP was founded largely on elements from Al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban (TTA), and the TTP based in Afghanistan. Prominent disillusioned colourful commanders such as Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost earlier in TTA and Abdul Qahir Khorasani were active in the formation of TTP to which most belonged Hafiz Saeed Khan. Khan, himself a former TTP commander, had a major ideological and business rivalry with TTP’s chief, Fazalullah which compelled him to cross over to ISKP. Hafiz Saeed Khan was the first emir of ISKP, and the majority of ISKP fighters are linked with the TTP or TTA organizations. Another weird note about the early leadership of ISKP is that Abdul Rahman Muslim Doat, who participated in the founding of ISKP, switched sides and returned to the Afghan Taliban. This absolutely negates IAG assertion that the leadership or operations of ISKP are being coordinated from Pakistan. Instead, ISKP was a group that originated in Afghanistan’s own conditions, let alone the impact of factors such as India. Such ‘double game’ of India with ISKP only seems to complicate the narrative which the IAG seems to be propounding. Right from its formation, it has had a connection with Indian militants. It is on record that when ISKP was formed in Nangarhar, Afghanistan dozens of Indian militants had surrendered to the group. Information about active Indian involvement with the group emerged in the last year, when 13 Indian ISKP militants were reportedly killed in a U.S. airstrike (MOAB) in Tora Bora mountains. Furthermore, some of the terrorists belong to ISKP have carried out significant attacks within India and its neighborhood. Mohammed Muhasin from Kerala is a known name linked with an attack in Kabul’s Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib in March 2020. In August 2020, another Indian, Abu Rawaha al-Muhajir, undertook a suicide vehicle bombing on Jalalabad prison. These attacks establish ISKP linkages with India and deal another blow to the propaganda that ISKP is launching operations from Pakistan. However, own connections of ISKP with India do indicate a much larger regional context which is conveniently overshadowed by Afghan and Indian authorities. Growing allegations by IAG on Pakistan appear to be in fact phony strategies in order to absolve themselves of their inability to counter TTP within Afghanistan. The Afghan government has failed to stop TTP the use Afghan territory to launch an operation against Pakistan even after they were requested to do so and provided clear evidence by Islamabad. The TTP which is reported to have carried out several terrorist attacks in Pakistan still enjoys sanctuaries in Afghanistan. India has a stakes in this narrative, and needs to promote it. Indian Media is no doubt among the major sources of Anti-Pakistan propaganda. Indian platforms have given open mikes to known terrorists such as Ehsan Ullah Ehsan, former TTP spokesperson to perpetrate the misinformation. Indian newspapers like the ‘Sunday Guardian ‘frequently features articles written by known terrorists and the nexus between Indian RAW and Afghan GDI in working to destabilise Pakistan through proxy groups such TTP and ISKP. Pakistan has been the recipient of insurgent strikes from both TTP and ISKP. A total of 265 people were killed in 13 attacks inside Pakistan in 2023 for which ISKP took the responsibility. The bombings include one at a political rally in Bajaur where more than 60 people were killed by a suicide bomber and another event in Mastung where more than 50 people were killed by a similar bomber. All these attacks were coordinated from Afghanistan territory, which shows that ISKP has its strong base there. Recent peer accounts including the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) have time and again amplified the presence of ISKP, TTP & other terrorist groups in Afghanistan. These groups have joined hands in conducting cross border raids in Pakistan thus proving the Afghanistan’s centrality as a theater of terror in Pakistan. It is a violation of the Doha Agreement since the terrorist groups remain actively operating in Afghanistan today, namely ISKP, TTP, and even Al Qaeda. There are two broad principles of the agreement; the Taliban cannot launch terrorism activities from Afghan territory. Still, the Afghan government displays its inability either to stop the recruitment of Afghan nationals into these groups or cease their cross-border activities. The recent UN sanctions reports which have just been released amplify that the Afghan Taliban has not complied with its counterterrorism obligations thus #Afghanistan ‘s stocks erode. Since the September 11 attack, Pakistan has remained quite straight forward as a country in term of its policy towards terrorism. Such players originating from ISKP, TTP or Al Qaeda are anti Pakistan terrorists and shall be meted out an exemplary response in accordance with the law. Over the years, Pakistan has appealed to Afghanistan to pursue the terrorist groups living in that country, but having had no cooperation they are going to protect their country and the region from terrorism. These richly baseless allegations by the IAG against Pakistan in regard to ISKP is nothing else but a ploy to mask its inefficiency in tackling TTP and other terrorist outfits in their own territories. Cross-border terrorism remains a threat for Pakistan, the victim of militant activity in Afghanistan, which will continue to see ISKP and TTP terrorists operate and plan attacks. The world needs to accept facts about ISKP and relationships which support it instead of being trapped into the dissected goal of a country to destabilize Pakistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3cgjojmG4DSc	2024-10-21T09:28:12-07:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Turkey Page (Part II) – OpEd	Ethiopia’s aggression against Somalia this year, is as unexpected as anyone can imagine. Although the two countries were more or less at peace with each other for some two decades, it would appear the peace was only in place because there was no Somali government of substance in the region for these decades. As soon as Ethiopia felt that Somalia was on the rise again, it came up with its true colors of antagonism and aggression with a direct attempt to break the back of the Somali people. It was not enough what Meles Zenawi did in 2006/2007 through the Ethiopian-organized IGADSOM invasion of Somalia and the creation of religious terrorism in the country. This time, Ethiopia’s current administration, in the place of maintaining the growing cordial relations between the two countries, has forced one of the regions of Somalia to sign an illegal MoU on the first day of this memorable year 2024 in the Somali calendar, wherein it would take a part of Somalia’s sea and territory. Türkiye, one of the key countries involved in both countries had no choice but to intervene to calm down the situation and keep it from becoming beyond a diplomatic impasse. It offered to mediate between the two countries. Several sessions of the mediation process have already taken place, but all have ended up to naught, so far. One must note that Türkiye is a key partner of Somalia and is a vanguard party in Somalia’s forward moves to recover from the years of crises, socially, economically and even politically. It was, indeed, a basket case for years. Türkiye’s help was welcomed by Somalia with a full heart. On the other side, Türkiye was supplying Ethiopia with its iconic TB-2 UAVs to tilt the war with its breakaway Tigray region in its favor. Türkiye had no choice but to intervene and mediate between the two countries as it has, indeed, a good relationship with both. This is a tall order, indeed. Ethiopia is no longer satisfied with its landlocked status and has avowed to have access to a sea, threatening thus all the smaller coastal countries in the region. Somalia appeared to be the weakest in the link and accordingly, it embarked on the illegal MoU, which has since become famous and an instigator of a potentially devastating war in the region. Türkiye wants, as Somalia also wants, to have the MoU withdrawn, thus maintaining Somalia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty intact with Ethiopia having access to a sea. One must note that Türkiye had already committed itself to protect not only the waters of Somalia but also to the territorial integrity of the country. It is strategic military contract between the two countries. Ethiopia needs to have access to new arms and technologies which Türkiye can supply, and Türkiye needs customers for its new and advanced technological weaponry such as the TB-2 UAVs. Both countries offer a ready market for Türkiye’s defense goods, and should it succeed in mediating between them, this would enhance it proactive foreign policy. It is a risky proposition for Türkiye for if the mediation fails, it could lead to a destabilization of the region, which would have negative consequences for its interests in the region. In this respect, one must keep in mind Türkiye’s deepening involvement in the potential and growing hydrocarbon industry of the region, where it has signed contracts with Somalia. Settling the growing dispute between the two countries would greatly add to Türkiye’s prestige and open more doors for it in the African continent and beyond. The exploration of oil and gas through cooperation with Türkiye would naturally lead to other contracts involving not only drilling activities but also to building contracts with respect to the transportation infrastructures in terms of pipes, storage tanks, and shipping equipment. One must note that Türkiye’s ambitions include becoming an energy distribution hub and Somalia could become an integral part of that process, wherein Somalia’s hydrocarbon transfers to Europe and beyond will pass through Türkiye. The Turkish naval presence in the waters of Somalia is a stabilizing factor and a deterrent against the ongoing security fears of the region. There is now a growing Chinese, Indian and other naval forces in the region and since they do not see eye to eye on many issues, the insecurities could grow tangibly as well. Türkiye is helping develop a Somali naval force which will be able, as it used to be in the past, to protect its waters from normal threats of piracy and other criminal activities. Türkiye’s involvement in the region has indeed international implications as major powers are also competing in the region. Türkiye’s involvement in helping protect Somalia’s waters will contribute to reversing the passage of terrorists, illegal migration, and illegal goods in the waters of Somalia, which appear to have dominated these waters ever since the collapse of the government of Somalia, some three decades ago. Keeping the region stable is amenable to Türkiye interests as well the interests of the countries of the region. They have suffered enough from not only environmental calamities but also from internal civil wars. They do not need to add new intra-state wars, which would only benefit the evil forces that have so far dominated the region. This would help Türkiye in opening more doors for itself in the African continent and in particular the Sahel region which has similar terror and resource competition issues as the Horn of Africa States region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3Y41McruRy_8	2024-10-21T09:25:25-07:00	
Dominance Of Mining Corporations And Distressed Democracy In Odis...	Odisha is home to abundant reserves of high-grade natural resources like iron, bauxite, chromite, and manganese ore, along with other valuable minerals such as coal, limestone, dolomite, tin, nickel, vanadium, lead, graphite, gold, gemstones, diamonds, and decorative stones. The resource-rich Odisha accounts for 57 percent of India's iron ore production, with over 60 active mines and more than 150 square kilometres under exploration for additional mineral resources. The people of Odisha are neither shareholders nor beneficiaries of the state's vast mineral resources. Ironically, the poorest of the poor reside in the mineral-rich regions of Odisha, highlighting the stark inequality in the distribution of wealth and benefits from these natural assets. The paradox of plenty defines the state of development in Odisha where poverty and hunger continue to be the national and international news. Since independence, Odisha has consistently been pro-business and mining led industrialisation. Successive governments, led by various political parties such as the Congress Party, Swatantra Party, Janata Dal, Janata Party, Biju Janata Dal (BJD), and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have provided uninterrupted support to business houses and mining-led industrial corporations in the name of economic growth and development in Odisha. However, instead of genuine economic development, the people have witnessed the persistent dominance of mining corporations over democracy, turning the mineral-rich region into a state of resource curse for its inhabitants. The rent-seeking nature of the state and government in Odisha has failed to support either economic growth or human development for its people. Instead, it has reinforced the dominance of caste, class, and the propertied elite, entrenching their control over both the state and its governance of resources. This has laid the foundation for a neopatrimonial relationship between the state, government, businesses, and mining corporations, further consolidating mining corporations’ power and profit at the expense of equitable development in the state. This dominance of mining corporations over democracy in Odisha has led to a persistent political and economic crisis for the people of the state. Performance Audit of Systems and Controls in Assessment and Collection of Revenue from Major Minerals for the year ended March 2022 (Report No. 6 of the year 2024) by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)reveals that the state government has helped mining corporations which led to the massive loss of mining revenue. The state exchequer has also lost massively due to the undervaluation of mineral ores by the Government of Odisha. This undue support by the government to private mining corporations comes with massive political donations. Mining corporations in Odisha have paid ₹601 crore in electoral bonds to various political parties. All major parties, including the BJD, BJP, and Congress, have received their share of this political fee in exchange for supporting mining interests in the state. The BJD received the largest share, amounting to ₹453 crore, while the BJP received ₹145 crore, all from six active mining companies operating in Odisha. Who cares about the mining revenue loss of ₹22,392 crore to the Odisha exchequer? Who cares about the ₹10,294 crore lost due to the undervaluation of ores? Who cares about the people and the environment in Odisha's mining regions? Mainstream political parties, mining corporations, and both ruling and non-ruling elites are working together to uphold each other’s interests, while the people and environment in Odisha continue to suffer in unemployment, poverty, hunger, underdevelopment and illness. Successive governments led by mainstream political parties have consistently provided unwavering support to mining companies and other extractive industries, allowing them to exploit the state's natural resources as if the government exists solely for their benefit, rather than for the people of Odisha. This collaboration not only undermines democracy but also destroys the conditions necessary for deepening democratic governance in the state. The collaboration and dominance of mining corporations over politics, political parties, leaders, and governments is undermining democracy in the state. Both the ruling party and opposition parties, along with their leaders, benefit from political donations to provide support for the mining companies. This crony capitalism, driven by mining companies and their extractive practices, is ruining the state's economy, politics, environment, and the democratic future of the people in Odisha. The BJP came to power by ending more than two decades of BJD rule in the state, but their economic and mining policy positions are not very different. Both the ruling BJP and opposition BJD share an unwavering commitment to mining companies. The new Chief Minister of Odisha, Mr. Mohan Charan Majhi, hails from a tribal community; however, the marginalisation and displacement of tribals from their land due to mining does not seem to concern him. He is actively working to hand over forest areas and tribal lands for mining without any political or moral qualms, despite being a tribal leader. Political parties and leaders are under the influence of mining companies, with regular paycheques from these corporations establishing a foundation for pro-mining narratives among political parties and their leaders, regardless of their political affiliations. Mining is a risk-free business in Odisha. The protection of land, natural resources, and livelihoods is crucial for peace and prosperity in the state. History reveals that economic growth driven by mining-led industrialisation does not eliminate poverty and hunger. Cooperative and collective ownership of natural resources, along with egalitarian distribution and governance, can help eradicate poverty, hunger, and underdevelopment in the state. In this context, the people of Odisha need to pursue a new politics that ensures that people become shareholders and owners of the state’s mineral resources. The first step is to mobilise the working population to oppose mining corporations and break their grip on politics, the state, and the government. Radical alternative politics in Odisha can only pursue policies of egalitarian resource redistribution only by focusing on equality, justice, and liberty as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3d-WdxIa1_WC	2024-10-21T09:23:24-07:00	
Implications Of Indo-US Strategic Partnership On South Asia – OpE...	The south Asia region is setting the stage for the great power competition, as China and US use diplomacy to contain each other, leading to increase rivalry. The US dominance has been challenged by China, a rising economic power in the region. Over two decades, the US has strengthened its strategic partnership with India through initiatives like QUAD and I2U2, aimed at countering China’s growing influence and maintaining the dominant status of US in the Indo Pacific region. This partnership includes cooperation in trade, defense, technology, and various other fields, which has deep implications for South Asia, a region already burdened with historical rivalry, arms race, and under developed infrastructure. As a result South Asia has become victim of the new great powers competition. The rivalry between the major players affects the smaller states of the region, consequently, the expanding Indo-US strategic partnership is continuously hindering the regional cooperation in South Asia. Furthermore, China is one of the emerging dominant powers in the world, having developed various projects such as Infrastructure development in Srilanka, military cooperation with the Maldives and CPEC project in Pakistan to counter influence of United States. On other hand India and the US have deepened the strategic partnership, which has gravely impacted the South Asian nations. The shared political interests of India and US in countering China had led to significant changes in both countries policies. Additionally the shift in US foreign policy towards India has strengthened China’s partnership in South Asia, escalating geopolitical tensions in the region. The Indo-US partnership has been marked by numerous agreements including Civil Nuclear Agreement 2005, Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016, Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018 and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) in 2020. The Civil Nuclear Agreement of 2005 un-officially granted the India the status of De-facto nuclear state and lifted technological restrictions allowing India to modernize its military capabilities. As a result the Indo-US partnership is accelerating military modernization and triggering an arms race in the region, raising security concerns for countries like China and Pakistan. Moreover, the Indo-US partnership appears to move away from conflict resolution mechanism in the region, allowing India to strengthen its influence both regionally and beyond. For instance 2019 Balakot crisis and the Indian submarine incursion near Pakistan’s territorial water highlighting India’s aggressive behavior. However Pakistan as a responsible actor, always strives to maintain peace and stability. While the US has historically acted as a mediator in India and Pakistan relations, its increasing partnership with India is undermining its neutrality in the conflict. Consequently, India’s refusal to restart confidence-building measures, coupled with its irresponsible and belligerent behavior and tolerance from the US allows India to dominate the South Asian region. Additionally, The Indo-US partnership is fulfills the economic interests of both countries through trade and investment in defense, information technology and in energy sector. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) 2024, India is the largest arms importer in the world. It imports about 9.8% of the total global arms supply. However 62% of these imports come from Russian and 10% from US, Therefore, the US is enhancing its cooperation with India to encourage the country to reduce its dependency on Russian weapons and shift more of its arms import from Russia to US. This shift would lead to economic gains for the US and further increase its influence in South Asia, enabling it to counter the economic rise of China and Russia. Although China founded the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project for regional connectivity, many of the smaller states of South Asia such as Pakistan, Srilanka, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh have joined it. Analogously the US and India have also initiated the Build Better World (B3W) and India Middle East Europe (IMEC) projects to counter the China’s influence in the region. However this situation presents a herculean task for the smaller states of the South Asia which must decide whether to align with China, Indo-US or to remain neutral. This growing polarization adds to the regions geopolitical challenges. As a result, Indo-US strategic partnership is causing significant geo-political changes in South Asia. It has undermined the effectiveness of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) by reinforcing India’s aggressive posture, which exacerbates regional tensions and fuels an arms race. This increases the likelihood discord and hampers conflict resolution efforts. Furthermore, non-traditional security threats such as climate change, poverty, and food security are being left unaddressed due to India’s non-cooperative policy in the region. Ultimately, the Indo-US strategic cooperation is transforming South Asia in to a hotspot for the great-power competition, contributing to the regional instability rather than enhancing cooperation and resolving existing tensions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3W_TbGgMTGtt	2024-10-21T09:21:35-07:00	
Opening Border Crossings Without Passports: A Threat To Pakistan’...	The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), formed in 2018, considers itself a representation of the rights and interests of the Pashtun people, particularly in the context of their grievances related to military operations and state policies in Pakistan’s border regions. The movement gained significant attention following a grand jirga that convened on 13 October 2024, to address these issues, advocating for improved living conditions and accountability for alleged state abuses. Among some of the demands, PTM has proposed the opening of border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan without passports, framing it as a measure to enhance connectivity and facilitate trade. However, it is imperative to scrutinize the potential consequences of such a move for Pakistan’s security and economy. The stark realities of a porous border suggest that the risks far outweigh the benefits. Primarily, an open border facilitates a myriad of illegal activities, including smuggling, drug trafficking, and human trafficking, all of which can profoundly harm the interests of ordinary citizens. Manzoor Pashteen, along with various mafias, appears to advocate for maintaining the status quo, wherein smuggling flourishes unchecked. This situation raises alarms, as the estimated cost of smuggling to Pakistan’s economy hovers around $1 billion annually, a figure that encapsulates lost revenue and rampant corruption. Such losses not only strain public finances but also undermine the legitimacy of the state. Furthermore, the implications of human trafficking cannot be overstated. Each year, over 10,000 individuals are trafficked across the border, many of whom face exploitation, violence, and even death. The vulnerability of these individuals highlights the urgent need for stronger border controls rather than the loosening of regulations. Instead of promoting free movement, the government should prioritize safeguarding its citizens from these grave threats. In addition to human suffering, legal businesses in Pakistan face crippling competition from smuggled goods, reporting losses that exceed $2 billion. This scenario not only affects the local economy but also diminishes taxpayer revenues, as legitimate businesses struggle to survive against unfair competition. The proliferation of smuggled goods thus poses a significant threat to the economic stability of the nation and raises critical questions about the priorities of those advocating for open borders. Moreover, the illegal influx of firearms presents a dire threat to national security. It is estimated that over 50,000 illegal firearms enter Pakistan from Afghanistan annually, contributing to violence and instability. The porous nature of the border allows terrorist groups to operate with impunity, as evidenced by the fact that over 60% of attacks in Pakistan can be attributed to groups exploiting Afghan territory. This statistic should serve as a wake-up call, urging policymakers to reinforce border security rather than dismantling it. Indeed, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan have already witnessed a concerning 30% rise in terror-related incidents in 2024, resulting in significant casualties among security forces. The collaboration between mafias and terror networks creates a vicious cycle of violence, wherein local populations bear the brunt of the deteriorating security landscape. It is crucial to recognize that calls for open borders not only ignore the existing challenges but also risk exacerbating them. In terms of narcotics, the stakes are alarmingly high. Between September 2023 and June 2024, authorities seized 1,041 metric tons of narcotics, with daily seizures averaging 2-3 tons. The staggering worth of these drugs has inevitably attracted the attention of criminal mafias that benefit from the ongoing trade. Allowing an open border would only empower these networks, undermining law enforcement efforts and perpetuating a cycle of addiction and violence. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has also ramped up its activities, with an estimated 1,500 to 3,000 fighters operating in the border regions, further complicating the security landscape. The rise of such extremist groups has been accompanied by a notable 30% increase in violence in 2024, with over 200 reported incidents attributed to these factions in KP and Balochistan. This troubling trend underscores the need for a robust security framework rather than a relaxed border policy. In conclusion, the call to open border crossings without passports raises critical concerns about the safety and well-being of Pakistan’s citizens. While advocates may tout the benefits of enhanced connectivity, the reality is that such a move would likely facilitate illegal activities that undermine the nation’s security and economy. It is essential for policymakers to prioritize the protection of their citizens and the integrity of the state by reinforcing border controls, thus preventing the further erosion of law and order. The situation demands a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of smuggling and trafficking while safeguarding Pakistan’s future. Only through a concerted effort can the state reclaim control over its borders and ensure a more secure environment for its people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBmd2cwhMe3adj5xVOforT	2024-10-21T09:20:05-07:00	
Chickpeas: Sustainable And Climate-Friendly Foods Of The Future	Climate change has a negative impact on food security. An international research team led by Wolfram Weckwerth from the University of Vienna has now conducted a study to investigate the natural variation of different chickpea genotypes and their resistance to drought stress. The scientists were able to show that chickpeas are a drought-resistant legume plant with a high protein content that can complement grain cultivation systems even in urban areas. The study was recently published in the specialist magazine The Plant Biotechnology. Long periods of drought stress have also become a reality in Central Europe due to climate change, a major threat to plant productivity, harvests and therefore food security. At the same time, there is a decline in the use of plant genetic diversity, and the global food system has become more and more uniform. While there are approximately 7,000 edible crops, two-thirds of global food production is based on just nine crop species. 'This narrow genetic base can have several negative consequences, such as increased susceptibility of plants to diseases and pests, reduced resistance to factors such as drought and climate change, and increased economic fragility,' explains molecular biologist Wolfram Weckwerth from the University of Vienna. 'Maintaining adequate plant and genetic diversity is crucial for agriculture, which must adapt to future changing conditions. With our new study, we have taken an important step in this direction and looked at the chickpea as an important food of the future,' says Weckwerth The chickpea is currently not one of the plants mentioned above on which the global diet is currently mainly based. The international research team led by Wolfram Weckwerth has now researched the natural variations of different chickpea genotypes and their resistance to drought stress and achieved promising results. The team managed to grow many different chickpea varieties under drought stress in a field experiment in a Vienna city region, demonstrating that chickpeas are a great alternative legume plant with a high protein content that can complement grain farming systems in urban areas. 'The different varieties and wild types show very different mechanisms to deal with persistent drought stress. This natural genetic variability is particularly important in order to withstand climate change and ensure the survival of the plant,' says Weckwerth. 'In our study, we used a stress susceptibility index (SSI) to assess the effects of drought stress on yield. This allowed us to identify genotypes that perform best and worst under stressful conditions. Our findings are crucial for the selection of genotypes for breeding drought-tolerant chickpeas,' explains Palak Chaturvedi from the University of Vienna, lead author of the study. The team used artificial intelligence, multivariate statistics and modeling to identify markers and mechanisms for better resilience to drought stress. 'With their high protein content and their drought resistance, legumes such as chickpeas are a food of the future. Another advantage is that a higher proportion of legumes in a country's agricultural systems improves the overall efficiency of nitrogen use - this also makes agriculture more sustainable,' summarizes Weckwerth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcpQYRuDVqa4rJ1C6BVB_gm	2024-10-20T15:48:47-07:00	
Global Aid Funds Face Fundraising ‘Traffic Jam’	Major global developmentfundsand institutions could struggle to secure the billions of dollars needed to support the world’s least affluent countries as they embark on new funding campaigns, according to analysts. Areportpublished today (Wednesday) by the Center for Global Development says that funds including The World Bank’s International Development Association, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are seeking to replenish their coffers with a combined total of about US$100 billion in grants from donors over the course of 2024 and 2025. This is creating what the report’s authors call a 'replenishment traffic jam', whereby different institutions are lining up for a share of the same limited basket of resources amid aid budget cuts in several countries. Economic headwinds Charities warned in September that the UK’s spending on overseas bilateral humanitarian and development could fall to a 17-year low of 0.36 per cent this year, ahead of an autumn budget announcement later this month. The German governmentsaidin August that it would cut funding for global development cooperation by almost 1 billion euros next year, which comes on top of severe cuts to its 2024 aid budget. According to Janeen Madan Keller, co-author of the report and deputy director of the Global Health Policy Program at the Center for Global Development, foreign aid budgets from the biggest development players are under pressure due to economic headwinds, which makes the current fundraising bids especially challenging. Not only are top donors like the European Union, Germany and France slashing their aid budgets, but the funds that distribute aid keep relying on the same small group of donors, said Keller. 'So, what we’re seeing is the same donors being asked to contribute to these same replenishments,' she toldSciDev.Net. Another issue is that a growing number of aid funds are being created with a specific focus, such as pandemic preparedness or climate response, while the pot of money they’re competing for dwindles, said Keller. Aid at risk 'Prospects for fully replenishing all these funds’ coffers look grim asgovernmentscontinue to cut aid budgets and elections add even more uncertainty to pledges, especially where they entail transitions between political parties,' says the Center for Global Development’s report. It remains to be seen whether development funds will actually fail to raise enough money, since the replenishment season is still underway. But if the money does fall short, aid flows could be jeopardised, with potentially dire consequences for the poorest countries in the world. 'You don’t want [aid] to go up and down, because when it goes down, that can have permanent effects,' said Jean-Louis Arcand, president of the Global Development Network, who wasn’t involved in the report. One typical example is when someone in a poor country loses their job as a result of cuts, they might not be able to afford to keep their children in school, Arcand toldSciDev.Net. Aid budget cuts by major donors such as the UK and Germany could have direct consequences on the stability of aid, which is essential in countries where large shares of government budgets are made up of aid money, said Arcand. 'If the Germans, the UK, cut [aid budgets], the people who are going to get hurt are the people in the least developed countries,' he said. The World Bank, which oversees the International Development Association, or IDA, says there is a need to step up ambition for the IDA since multiple crises have set back progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and development. However, it declined to comment directly on the report’s findings. A Global Fund spokesperson said the Fund hoped to launch its investment case in the first quarter of next year in a 'challenging' context of development finance. The Fund has mobilised an additional US$109.4 million since its last replenishment, or fundraising cycle, so has been able to invest more than expected in the current period, the spokesperson added. More broadly, decreasing aid budgets and reduced domestic financing for health threaten to impact the delivery of 'core and essential life-saving care … such as antiretrovirals,malariabed nets, therapeutics and diagnostics' as well as investment in the next generation of solutions, the spokesperson said. Gavi didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Bucking the trend Elise Dufief, research lead at IDDRI, a France-based sustainable development think tank, said that the latest aid budget cuts do warrant concern, but that some countries are leading the way in increasing contributions. Denmark has said it will increase its aid contributions by 40 per cent and good news is also expected from South Korea, said Dufief, while some African countries have pledged contributions to the African Development Fund. 'I think these countries are really showing that they can decide that they want to contribute and lead on these issues, and hopefully encourage others to join as well,' she said.

From Waste To Resource: Recovering Nutrients To Fertilize The Fut...	Europe faces growing food supply demands and a shortage of non-renewable raw materials for fertilisers. But producing more from available resources is possible, say researchers: 'The nutrients we need are before our eyes, ready to be transformed.' European farmers face a monumental dual challenge: increasing food production while meeting daunting deadlines imposed by the green transition. Amid the drive to produce greener, more efficient fertilisers, new technologies seek to squeeze maximum potential from nutrients that have long been imported, but which until now have been under-exploited. 'An important part of the nutrients we have been importing for years are here, ready to be transformed and to be given another life,' says Javier Brañas Lasala, Director of Research, Development and Innovation at the Spanish fertiliser producer Fertiberia. Using nutrients from bio-waste to reduce Europe’s dependency on non-renewable raw materials and increase the efficiency of new sustainable fertilisers is one of the main goals of B-Ferst, a 5-year European project he coordinates, due to end this October. The European Commission president has highlighted the challenge of securing future food supplies, via sustainable farming that protects nature and respects climate goals. Where are we at globally in facing that challenge? We’re on the way to guarantee the food supply for everyone, but it's still not achieved. The population is growing and unfortunately there are countries and people that don't have enough food. So, we need to increase food production, but we cannot use more land. We need a technological increase in farming systems, to produce more per hectare in a sustainable way. The challenge is very big, because Europe has decided to increase the surface area dedicated to organic farming to 30% in a few years, and organic farming is less productive than traditional farming. So, we must bet on high value-added products and put together all the knowledge we have in order to be much more efficient and at the same time more respectful of the environment. In recent years we’ve seen the pandemic, war in Europe, ongoing disruption to supplies, higher prices. How urgent does that make this transition? As fast as possible, but I’m not sure if we're getting there on time, because it’s not an easy challenge. However, the European Commission has been very clear with dates and deadlines and together with European companies it’s putting a lot of money into research and innovation. The EU still depends on non-renewable raw materials and uses natural gas as its main energy source for producing fertilisers. Are we still not a long way off achieving set goals? It must be step by step. Europe doesn’t have the natural resources to produce the nutrients needed for farming. But we do have a large part of the nutrients we’ve been importing for years: in waste treatment plants, in agricultural soils. We have them here — tons and tons of phosphates and potash and so on — ready to be transformed. We’ve been trying to do that, for phosphorus and for potassium mainly. With nitrogen fertilisers we have the same problem: nitrogen plus hydrogen produce ammonia, and the hydrogen comes from natural gas. Even so, many companies in our sector are setting very ambitious decarbonisation targets, betting on renewable energies and innovating to gradually reduce their carbon footprint and to offer European agriculture sustainable and smart crop nutrition solutions, in line with what society demands. The B-Ferst project set out to valorise underexploited bio-waste, develop new green fertilisers, substitute raw materials, and cut energy consumption. How much has been achieved? We have two goals here: one is nutrient recovery; the other is to increase the nutrients’ performance. The first — the circular economy, the re-use of nutrients from bio-waste — is not easy: a lot of new technologies are under development, but they’re not cheap. There is a logistic issue: the residues are produced in different places, their composition varies during the year, supply is temporal, mostly the nutrients need to be concentrated. You can’t transport low-concentrated bio-waste nutrients far: moving liquid manure 400 kilometres, for example, is expensive. An industrial process is needed to transform a bio-waste into a raw material. Some bio-waste is suitable for fertiliser production, but most needs more development. The project’s objective wasn’t to make fertilisers 100% from bio-waste because that’s nearly impossible at a big scale. But we can produce fertilisers by partially substituting nutrients, with about 20% coming from bio-waste. However, to have more impact in Europe, with more fertiliser producers doing the same, a bigger effort is needed from waste management companies to develop processes to transform this bio-waste into raw materials. And the second objective, to increase the nutrients’ efficiency? We’ve got that through the development of bio-stimulants that increase the efficiency of the nutrients you apply to the soil. It’s very exciting to see how we can make these fertilisers more efficient and more advanced. We’ve also produced special innovative coatings to protect the bio-stimulants, increase the nutrients’ efficiency and protect them in the soil from leeching. With these new additives we’ve found we can increase production by between 5 to 15%. Some reports identify potentially serious barriers, particularly financial and on crop yields. Other reports have also highlighted problems with pricing and regulation. Won’t the new fertilisers be too expensive for farmers? Pricing, like quality, is of course very important: in the end if it's not economically viable it won’t work. Of course, transforming bio-waste into a raw material and moving it from the point of production to the fertiliser plant are costly but farmers aren't going to pay much more for these fertilisers; it’s hard enough for them producing food for us, we can’t make their job harder still! Any difference in price between BFerst fertilisers and conventional ones should be small, but the benefits will be much higher. So, our message is: 'yes, maybe this will be just a little more expensive, but we’re going to produce more per square metre'. Higher yields… Yes, in the end it's going to be a win-win, they're going to produce more, and via a circular economy that uses high-technology bio-stimulants to make fertilisers. We get everything we were looking for: higher yields, lower environmental impact. Are there communication problems with the industry and can they be overcome? I think the farmers will always valorise the best product for their business. The first thing is to show that their production has been higher per kilogram of nutrient they're applying. So, on numbers alone, farmers will be convinced by the economic benefits. Afterwards, we’ll highlight the environmental advantages such as carbon footprint and waste reduction — and argue that they're contributing to make Europe stronger because we’ll be less dependent on natural resources from abroad, very important at a time of international tension.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen11mj3oFyKw7v6L8moPO_	2024-10-20T15:38:42-07:00	
How Airbnb Could Help Curb The Rise In Housing Costs	Home-rental platforms like Airbnb are known to drive up housing costs, but a new study shows that doing a better job of collecting the taxes owed by these home rentals appears to slow the rise in home prices. The finding suggests that tax policy can help to mitigate rising home prices, particularly in areas where there are a lot of short-term rental properties. 'It’s well established that Airbnb rentals can drive up home prices, and that’s because a lot of homeowners who use Airbnb or similar services are not paying the taxes that they’re supposed to,' says Jared Smith, co-author of a paper on the work and an associate professor of finance in North Carolina State University’s Poole College of Management. 'For example, hotels have to pay taxes imposed by local governments on short-term rentals,' Smith says. 'Airbnb hosts are supposed to do this as well, but previous research tells us that as many as 75% of hosts aren’t paying those taxes. That makes being an Airbnb host particularly profitable. This drives up property prices by effectively encouraging people to purchase homes specifically to put them on the short-term rental market. The increased competition makes those properties more expensive for people who are seeking to rent or purchase a long-term home. 'Our goal with this work was to determine whether tax policy can make a difference,' Smith says. 'Specifically, we wanted to examine whether having companies that oversee short-term home rentals – like Airbnb – collect relevant taxes right off the top would help slow the rise in home prices.' For the study, researchers focused on Florida, where taxes are largely levied at the local level. Coupled with the fact that Florida garners a lot of tourist visitors, this made the state a good source of data that would allow researchers to assess the impact of local Airbnb tax collection efforts. The researchers collected county-level tax data from all 67 Florida counties for the years 2012-2019. Between 2015 and 2019, 41 Florida counties adopted tax enforcement agreements with Airbnb, in which Airbnb collects the taxes directly from the hosts who are renting the homes. In the remaining 26 counties, hosts are responsible for paying the taxes. 'In other words, by 2019, 41 counties had rules in place with Airbnb that meant the company collected 100% of the taxes that were due on Airbnb rentals,' Smith says. 'We used statistical approaches that allowed us to account for confounding variables and compare changes in both property prices and residential rent costs across all 67 counties. We refer to the combination of property price and rent costs as ‘housing costs.’' The researchers found that housing costs went up in every county. But housing costs in counties that did not have Airbnb tax enforcement agreements went up 1.6 to5.8% more than housing costs in counties that did have tax enforcement agreements. And the effect of the tax enforcement agreements varied according to the size of the housing unit. 'Essentially, the bigger the housing unit, the more pronounced the effect,' Smith says. 'For example, a one-bedroom apartment might have seen housing prices rise by an additional 1.6%, whereas a four-bedroom home would likely have seen a rise closer to 5.8%. 'In short, our findings suggest that implementing tax enforcement agreements with the companies that oversee the short-term rental industry could make a significant impact in slowing the rise of housing costs,' Smith says. 'This has two very real benefits. First, many parts of the country have been seeing skyrocketing housing prices, putting significant stress on both renters and homebuyers. This could help with that. Second, it guarantees that hosts will comply with existing tax requirements by removing the possibility of tax evasion, which is good news for the coffers of local governments and the services they provide.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfKh-y680HL22_63bikK-sP	2024-10-20T15:33:07-07:00	
Sweden Meets UN Targets For HIV Epidemic	Sweden has reached the UNAIDS and WHO targets for the HIV epidemic, according to a study in Eurosurveillance by researchers at Karolinska Institutet and others. According to the researchers, Sweden is the first country in the world to achieve these targets. Sweden has reached a historic milestone in the fight against HIV. A new study shows that Sweden has reached the UNAIDS and WHO targets for the HIV epidemic, known as the 95-95-95 target. This means that 95 percent of all people living with HIV in the country have been diagnosed, 95 percent of these are receiving treatment, and 95 percent of those treated have undetectable levels of the virus in their blood. The targets are to be reached by 2025. Sweden's figures are even better: 96 percent have been diagnosed, 99 percent are on treatment and 98 percent have undetectable virus levels. 'This is proof that it is possible to reach these ambitious targets. It shows that Sweden's infrastructure for finding and treating people with HIV is very effective,' says one of the researchers behind the study, Professor Anders Sönnerborg at the Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet. The study is based on data from the national HIV cohort established in 2003. Over 99 percent of all people diagnosed with HIV in Sweden are included in this cohort, and the data has been analyzed using advanced bioinformatics methods in collaboration with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States. 'We have shown that we have indeed reached the target. This means that people with HIV in Sweden have a life expectancy approaching that of non-HIV-infected people and that the vast majority of those diagnosed are not infectious,' says Anders Sönnerborg. The results are important because they show that it is possible to achieve the UNAIDS and WHO targets, which may inspire other countries to intensify their efforts against HIV. Despite the successes, challenges remain, such as late diagnosis, stigma and, not least, HIV cure. 'Research on HIV cure is now a top priority,' says Anders Sönnerborg Researchers at Karolinska Institutet are also continuing to work to ensure that the targets are maintained and to improve the quality of life for people living with HIV. 'We are now working on a fourth goal: that 95 percent of people living with HIV in Sweden should have a good quality of life,' says Anders Sönnerborg. Anders Sönnerborg says that Sweden is the first country with a published study that can show that these goals have been achieved. 'This success shows that Sweden is a leader in the fight against HIV and that it is possible to reach the global targets to end the HIV epidemic.' The study was conducted in close collaboration with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States, and has been funded by the NIH, the Swedish Research Council and Region Stockholm.

3D Printing Method May Improve Micro Energy Storage	One key to making portable devices more compact and energy efficient lies in the precise nanoscale form of energy-storing capacitors. Researchers in Sweden report they've cracked the challenge with a unique 3D printing method.Researchers at KTH Royal Institute of Technology demonstrated a 3D printing method for fabricating glass micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) that reduces the complexity and time required to form the intricate nanoscale features MSCs need. The advance could potentially lead to more compact and energy-efficient portable devices, including self-sustaining sensors, wearable devices and other Internet of Things applications, says Frank Niklaus, professor of micro- and nanosystems at KTH. Their study was published in ACS Nano. The new method addresses two key challenges to fabricating such devices. A micro-supercapacitor's performance is largely determined by its electrodes, which store and conduct electrical energy. So they need more electrode surface area, and they need nanoscale channels to facilitate rapid ion transport. Po-Han Huang, who was lead author of the study at KTH, says the new research addresses both challenges with through ultrashort laser pulse 3D printing technology. The researchers discovered that ultrashort laser pulses can induce two simultaneous reactions in hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), a glass-like precursor material. One reaction results in the formation of self-organized nanoplates, while the second converts the precursor into silicon-rich glass, which is the foundation of the 3D printing process. This enables the fast and precise fabrication of electrodes with plenty of open channels, which maximizes surface area and speeds up ion transport. The researchers demonstrated the approach by 3D-printing micro-supercapacitors that performed well even when charged and discharged very quickly. 'Our findings represent a significant leap forward in microfabrication, with broad implications for the development of high-performance energy storage devices,' Huang says. 'Beyond MSCs, our approach has exciting potential applications in fields such as optical communication, nanoelectromechanical sensors and 5D optical data storage.' The implications are also significant for technologies presently in common use. Supercapacitors of the non-micro type are already collecting energy generated during braking, stabilizing power supply in consumer electronics, and optimizing energy capture in renewable energy, Niklaus says. 'Micro-supercapacitors have the potential to make these applications more compact and efficient.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRSACLOX4vQWaRRIH7l7Ps	2024-10-20T15:24:35-07:00	
Iran Seeks Influence In Sudan Through An Influx Of Weapons – Anal...	Iran is working to take advantage of the chaos caused by Sudan’s civil war to gain a foothold on the Red Sea. Establishing a presence in Sudan would, in essence, enable Iran to box in its regional opponents, including Saudi Arabia and Israel, and threaten shipping through the Suez Canal, according to experts. 'It [Iran] considers it a starting point towards achieving long term strategic gains, in terms of expansion in Africa, control of the Red Sea and wider regional influence,' analyst Abdal Monim Himmat wrote recently for The Arab Weekly. Toward that end, Iran has spent more than a year rebuilding its relations with Sudan’s leadership, which is based in Port Sudan because the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) controls most of the national capital, Khartoum. In October 2023, Sudan and Iran resumed diplomatic ties and exchanged ambassadors after an eight-year break. Since then, Iran has supplied the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) with weapons to bolster its fight against the RSF. A crucial part of those weapon shipments has been the Iran-made Mohajer-6 and Ababil drones. The drones helped the SAF defeat RSF fighters. Earlier this year, the drones played a key role in driving the RSF out of parts of Omdurman and retaking the headquarters of Sudan’s national broadcaster. Mohajer-6 drones are capable of delivering explosives. In addition to Iranian weapons, the SAF increasingly relies on Iranian intelligence to aid its offensives against the RSF. Observers say Iran has helped the SAF recruit and train new soldiers drawn from people displaced by the fighting who have been trained at camps in Uganda. Iran has attempted to use its aid to the SAF as leverage to get the Sudanese leadership to approve an Iranian naval base on Sudan’s coast. The country has rejected that proposal along with a later proposal for a dual-use commercial and military port at Port Sudan. Iran’s aid has become a key component of the SAF’s effectiveness against the RSF. When the Iranian government was distracted by the death of President Sayyid Ebrahim Raisolsadati in May, the SAF’s battlefield actions suffered, according to observers. Sudan’s connections with Iran go beyond weapons and intelligence. 'The Sudanese Army seeks to leverage Iran’s presence as a tool to pressure anti-Iran regional and international actors, encouraging them to push the RSF toward agreeing to a ceasefire on the Army’s terms,' Hani al-Aasar wrote recently for the Emirates Policy Center. The RSF gets aid from the United Arab Emirates, which, along with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries has a tense relationship with Iran. So far, that strategy has not borne fruit, al-Aasar noted. Ultimately, Sudan is likely to come out on the losing end of Iran’s involvement in its civil war as the Islamic Republic expands its presence in the country. 'As the Sudanese army and Iran have clearly intensified their cooperation, speculation has arisen about Sudan’s vulnerability to Tehran’s influence,' al-Aasar wrote. 'The ongoing war between the Sudanese Army and the RSF has significantly eroded Sudan’s resilience against infiltration and influence by foreign powers.' In the short term, however, the influx of Iranian weapons creates the risk that Sudan’s internal conflict will worsen and might spread beyond its borders. 'Iranian weapons in Sudan will further ignite conflicts there and in surrounding countries,' Himmat wrote. 'It will turn the Red Sea into an arena for international confrontation, further complicating the security posture in region and exposing international navigation to major threats.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i866G2VThv7xZ	2024-10-19T17:27:08-07:00	
Tigray Must Avert Another Cycle Of War – Analysis	As tensions between two TPLF factions rise, urgent measures are needed to prevent another crisis in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. By Meressa K Dessu and Tegbaru Yared After two years of war in Ethiopia’s Tigray Region, the 2022 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) ended clashes between Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The parties agreed to find lasting and comprehensive solutions, including restoring constitutional order in Tigray. The TPLF was Tigray’s ruling party for over 30 years. Under the CoHA, it makes up only 51% of the new Tigray Interim Administration (TIA), reducing the party’s tradition of absolute control. Now the TPLF has split into two factions, and violent conflict looms again. Divisions are mainly between the party’s leaders in the TIA under Getachew Reda (TPLF Deputy Chair and Executive Committee Member) and those led by Party Chair Debretsion Gebremichael. The former say the latter are trying to undermine and fragment the administration, reducing the TIA’s control over local governance. Debretsion’s faction accuses the TIA of compromising Tigrayan interests,and recentlyclaimedthey disagreed with some CoHA provisions despite publicly committing to implementing the agreement. After coming to power following popular protests and violence in Ethiopia between 2016 and 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali restructured the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front – a coalition of four regional parties including the TPLF – into the Prosperity Party (PP). The TPLF said the move was illegal and refused to join the PP. This contributed to rising tensions between the PP-led federal government and the TPLF-led Tigray regional government, eventually culminating in the civil war thatkilledover 600 000 people. TPLF infighting could be an opportunity to spark a new political culture and marketplace of ideas in Tigray The CoHA helped establish an ‘inclusive’ TIA. Following his party's nomination, Getachew was appointed president of the interim administration by Abiy. While the TPLF has significant influence over the TIA, the body includes representatives from the political opposition, civil society, Tigray security force and intellectuals. Many Tigrayans have credited the TIA for improving relations with the federal government, helping return some internally displaced persons (IDPs), attempting to separate party and state structures, entertaining media freedom, and promoting assembly and freedom of speech. At the same time, the TIA has been criticised for not addressing crime, returning all IDPs or fully restoring Tigrayan authority to its pre-war status – some territories remain occupied by Eritrean and Amhara forces. The TIA has acknowledged its weaknesses on several occasions, but claims the TPLF’s factionalism has intensified its difficult task. Tensions resulted in the Getachew-led faction boycotting the 14thTPLF Congress in August, convened by Debretsion’s faction. Following the congress’ decisions, 16 senior political figures including Getachew were expelled from the party. The Getachew-led faction has however labelled the congress illegal and its decision ‘null and void.’ Some commentatorscriticisedthe congress for bypassing due process and lackingapprovalfrom the National Election Board of Ethiopia. The board is a federal institution that registers and manages political parties and ensures impartial elections in the country. TPLF infighting could, however, spark a new political culture, civic discourse and a marketplace of ideas in Tigray. Both factions hold public meetings freely to build support and haven’t resorted to using the state's coercive power to resolve their differences, as happened after the bloody 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritreawar. Any move by Tigray’s security forces in support of either faction would plunge the region into violence At the same time, various parts of Tigrayan society have become more assertive and organised, challenging both factions publicly and urging them to avoid violence. This has opened the political space with media outlets, intellectuals, civic organisations, youth and the diaspora expressing different perspectives on politics in Tigray. Healthy debates among the government, parties and social forces are emerging, which could encourage a more open society and non-violent politics – if sustained. The very existence of the two factions may lead to a more balanced, equitable political environment – if they become separate political parties. However, the situation is fragile. Both factions seek support from the Tigray security forces, which is a dangerous move against peace. Getachew’s group claims the TIA commands the security forces, but Debretsion’s faction refutes this. So far, the security forces have largely kept their neutral posture, with their leaders committing to maintaining peace and preventing looming anarchy in Tigray. At this point, any move by Tigray’s security forces to support either faction would plunge the region into more violence. Both sides have popular support, with the youth demanding real changes in the political landscape. Most Tigray security force members are young, so any misstep by their leaders could lead them into violence that will be hard to control. The TPLF dispute may invite legitimate federal government intervention, which Tigrayans may not welcome Another consideration is that the TPLF dispute may invite legitimate federal government intervention, which Tigrayans may not welcome. Any attempt by the Debretsion-led faction or other actors against the TIA will affect the federal government’s interests and could result in military interventions and further crisis. The region fought hard for self-administration and self-determination, so Tigrayans would struggle to accept such interventions. Delays in fully implementing the CoHA may also lead to conflict. The federal government committed to facilitating the return and reintegration of IDPs and refugees, yet hundreds of thousands remain stranded and desperate. More than a million people are displaced in Tigray, and over 70 000 sought refuge in Sudan, which now faces its own civil war. Their continued suffering and frustrations could lead to more violence unless solved urgently. The federal government also pledged to protect civilians and Tigray’s territories from foreign incursion, but variousreportsshow Eritrean forces are still in Tigray and continue committing atrocities against civilians. Recently, the US Special Envoy to the Horn of Africa Ambassador Mike Hammerwarnedthat this presence of Eritrean forces could ‘flame an already tragic situation.’ To prevent another war in Tigray, the CoHA must be fully implemented and political tensions between the TPLF factions resolved. The international community, particularly the African Union, United Nations and United States – who brokered the CoHA, and the European Union, must persuade the TPLF factions to resolve their differences peacefully. All parties to the CoHA should also be encouraged to honour their commitments. Leaders of Tigray’s security forces must maintain their neutrality and avoid intervening in support of either TPLF faction, lest the region be turned into chaos.

Ukraine Repels Russian Aerial Attack On Kyiv	Ukraine's military deployed air-defense systems late Saturday to repel an aerial assault on Kyiv, according to the capital's top elected official. 'Stay in shelters!' Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the scope of the aerial assault. Saturday's attack follows a visit to the city by French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who said a Ukrainian defeat would mean 'chaos' for the international order. According to Agence France-Presse, Barrot's speech came hours after Russian forces issued a statement claiming that they'd captured another village in the country's east. Barrot's visit, aimed at underlining Paris' unflinching support for Ukraine, comes at the end of a week in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unveiled his 'victory plan' to defeat Russia, again calling for beefed-up Western backing. 'A Russian victory would consecrate the law of the strongest and precipitate the international order towards chaos,' said Barrot, who also warned that recent reports of North Korean regular troops supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, if verified, would constitute a serious escalation of the war. France's top diplomat also said Paris was open to the idea of an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, but that talks would continue on the subject with allies. Barrot's stop in Kyiv coincided with the G7 defense ministerial meeting in Naples, Italy, which saw a pledge of 'unwavering' support for Ukraine, including vows of military aid, according to a final statement. 'We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,' read the group's final statement following the one-day summit.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8-N0DvfNDp6k	2024-10-19T17:24:04-07:00	
Making The Most Of EU Catch-All Control On Cyber-Surveillance Exp...	By Dr Mark Bromley and Giovanna Maletta In 2021 the European Union (EU) adopted a new iteration of the EU Dual-use Regulation, which sets common standards for EU member states’ controls on exports ofdual-use items. Among other new features,Regulation (EU) 2021/821introduces a new ‘catch-all control’ for cyber-surveillance items. This requires exporters to seek approval for exports of cyber-surveillance items when they become aware that the items are likely to be used in connection with human rights violations, even if those items are not specifically covered by existing export controls. It therefore gives EU member states the power to control such transfers. Although the proliferation and misuse of spyware and other cyber-surveillance tools are growing concerns, the use of the new catch-all control has been limited to date. One likely reason is that exporters appear to be unclear about how to apply it. This week, the EU published a newset of guidelinesintended to help exporters to comply with the catch-all control. This backgrounder examines the catch-all control and the new guidelines, highlighting their main features and limitations. It also suggests steps that could be taken by the newly elected European Parliament and others to improve the guidelines and support consistent, effective application of both the new catch-all control and restrictions on the trade in cyber-surveillance items more broadly. Export controls and cyber-surveillance tools Export controls rely on ‘control lists’ of specific items or categories of items that may only be exported after obtaining a licence from the competent national authorities. However, it is difficult to ensure that these lists cover all relevant items, especially in areas where technologies are developing rapidly. Moreover, there are products that are not controlled because they fall outside the technical thresholds but could nonetheless be used in ways the regulations aim to prevent. States have responded to this challenge by introducing ‘catch-all controls’ that impose a licence requirement on exports of non-listed items that are nevertheless likely to be used in prohibited ways or by prohibited end-users. The control list of the EU Dual-use Regulation is found in Annex I and is based on the control lists adopted by theWassenaar Arrangementand other multilateral export control regimes. Five categories of cyber-surveillance tools have been added to Annex I since 2013, toaddress concernsabout the misuse of these cyber-surveillance items by state actors in ways that threaten other states’ national security (for example, to enable the theft of sensitive data or attacks on critical infrastructure), or in connection with violations of human rights (for example, to facilitate the repression of political opponents through torture or unlawful detention). However, there are additional cyber-surveillance tools that are not captured by the EU dual-use control list. There are also many technologies that have legitimate civilian uses but that can be repurposed as cyber-surveillance tools or their subcomponents. To date, the EU’s control list includes no such ‘truly dual-use’ technologies—only what are better described as ‘single-use’ technologies that are specifically designed for use by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. States have so far been unwilling to control exports of truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools and related subcomponents for fear of disrupting the trade in legitimate cybersecurity tools. The new EU catch-all control on cyber-surveillance items and the accompanying guidelines have the potential to help close these gaps by expanding the set of cyber-surveillance items that are subject to control and selectively targeting exports of truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools. The EU cyber-surveillance catch-all control Prior to 2021 the EU Dual-use Regulation included three catch-all controls on non-listed items that may contribute to a weapons of mass destruction programme, have a ‘military end-use’ in a state subject to an arms embargo, or be used as parts or components in illegally exported military equipment. Article 5 of the 2021 Dual-use Regulation adds a new catch-all control that applies to non-listed cyber-surveillance items that ‘may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for use in connection with internal repression and/or the commission of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law’. Article 5 can be triggered in two ways. The national licensing authority can notify an exporter of the requirement for a licence. However, exporters are also obliged to inform their national licensing authority if, on the basis of their own due diligence findings, they become aware that the items are intended for a prohibited end-use, in which case the authority may decide the export cannot go ahead. One category of non-listed cyber-surveillance items that might be subject to a licence requirement under the catch-all control is mobile phone hacking services, which trick wireless carriers’ servers into revealing the location data of their users. Switzerlandhas proposedthat mobile phone hacking tools be covered by the Wassenaar Arrangement control list but this is unlikely to happen in the near future due to political divisions within the group. Another category is data-retention systems, which store collected surveillance data for later use by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. These have also been proposed for control at the Wassenaar Arrangement and are included in the national control lists ofGermany and Spain. Truly dual-use cyber-surveillance tools that might be covered by the catch-all control include, for example, tools for capturing and analysing biometric data, such as facial recognition tools. Another type isdual-intent tools, such as vulnerability scanners, that are designed to help organizations test their own vulnerability to cyberattacks but can also be used to perpetrate malicious cyberattacks. One important type of subcomponent that might be captured by the catch-all control isdeep packet inspection (DPI) technologies. DPI has a wide range of legitimate cybersecurity applications but is also used to enable the functioning of some cyber-surveillance tools. The new guidelines and what they say Article 5 of the Dual-use Regulation states that the Commission and Council ‘shall make available guidelines for exporters’ on how to implement their obligations under the catch-all control. The newCommission Recommendation (EU) 2024/2659, which was released on 16 October 2024 (but dated 11 October), fulfils that requirement. The guidelines are mainly concerned with clarifying for exporters when they should alert the licensing authority about a potential export. To do this they elaborate on the content of Article 5 and the definition of cyber-surveillance items provided by the Dual-use Regulation. This section looks at key aspects of those explanations and their implications. ‘Specially designed to enable . . . covert surveillance’ The Dual-use Regulation defines cyber-surveillance items as ‘dual-use items specially designed to enable the covert surveillance of natural persons by monitoring, extracting, collecting or analysing data from information and telecommunication systems’. According to the new guidelines, ‘specially designed’ means that covert surveillance must have been the ‘main purpose’ of the item’s development and design, although the item may have other possible uses. ‘Covert surveillance’ is explained as occurring when a person ‘cannot objectively expect to be under surveillance’. This definition potentially brings mobile phone hacking tools, data-retention systems and certain types of dual-intent product within the scope of Article 5. Less clear is if and how facial recognition and other biometric tools would be captured. Both the European Parliament and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)have advocatedfor biometric tools to be subject to controls, and in July 2024 it wasproposedthat facial recognition tools be included in the national control list of the United States. However, many of the mostconcerning applicationsof biometric tools involve the use of footage collected from CCTV cameras that are publicly visible. The guidelines say that ‘[f]acial and emotion recognition technologies that can be used to monitor or analyse stored video images, could fall within the scope of the definition of cyber-surveillance item’. However, if the system is drawing its data from publicly visible CCTV, then it is hard to see how it would meet the criterion ‘specially designed to enable...covert surveillance’, creating ambiguity. ‘Awareness’ that the items are ‘intended . . . for’ Regulation 2021/821 and the new guidelines reflect a wider trend in which NGOs and states are pushing for exporters to take on more responsibility for identifying potentially sensitive exports. Article 5 obliges an exporter to notify the authorities if it is ‘aware, according to its due diligence findings’ that cyber-surveillance items it proposes to export are intended for the proscribed uses. The guidelines state that ‘'aware' ... implies that the exporter has positive knowledge of the intended misuse’ and that ‘the exporter should assess the end-use on a case-by-case basis, in light of the specific circumstances of that case’ in order to identify whether an item may be ‘intended for’ a sensitive end-use. Significantly, the guidelines indicate that the due-diligence obligations apply not only to exporters of finished cyber-surveillance tools but also to exporters of products that ‘could be used as part or component’ of such a system. If the product was ‘specially designed to enable ... covert surveillance’, this implies that the catch-all control could potentially apply to exports of components such as DPI technologies that might be sold as civilian products but later integrated into a cyber-surveillance system. ‘Internal repression’, ‘serious violation of human rights’ and ‘serious violation of international humanitarian law’ To clarify what may constitute prohibited uses, the guidelines refer to language used in both the EU Common Position on arms exports (2008/944/CFSP) and its accompanyinguser’s guide. According to the Common Position, ‘internal repression includes ... torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, summary or arbitrary executions, disappearances, arbitrary detentions and other major violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms as set out in relevant international human rights instruments’. The user’s guide states that ‘the current and past record’ of the end-user and recipient country with regard to human rights should be considered to assess the risk of an exported item being used for internal repression. Similarly, for the interpretation of ‘serious violation of international humanitarian law’, the guidelines again refer to the Common Position user’s guide, which calls for assessing the recipient’s attitude towards international humanitarian law (IHL) by looking at its record, its formal commitments and its capacity to uphold relevant provisions. The Dual-use Regulation uses the Common Position as a point of reference for licensing authorities in making licensing decisions, so it is logical to also use it as a reference point for exporters assessing potential exports of cyber-surveillance tools. However, the Common Position and its user’s guide are focused on transfers of military equipment and do not consider several issues relevant to transfers of dual-use items and cyber-surveillance tools or other items captured by the Dual-use Regulation. In particular, they do not consider factors that would be relevant for assessing the recipient’s record regarding the appropriate use of cyber-surveillance tools or consider the specific IHL risks that might arise in connection with their use. Next steps for Article 5 and the guidelines Regulation 2021/821 tasks the Commission with conducting an evaluation, ‘after 10 September 2024’, of the new catch-all control for cyber-surveillance items. This gives the newly elected European Parliament and others an opportunity to clarify the intended coverage of the new catch-all control and strengthen the EU’s and EU member states’ controls on cyber-surveillance tools more broadly. These steps should include the following: Develop case studies In feedback on the first draft of the guidelines, which was published in March 2023, businesses and other stakeholders asked for ‘concrete practical examples’ of cyber-surveillance items potentially requiring an export licence under Article 5, accompanied by relevant case studies. These have not been included in the published guidelines. Although the guidelines rightly note that it is ‘impossible to provide an exhaustive list of those products that may be controlled as 'non-listed items' under Article 5’, it should be possible to develop real or fictional case studies. This could be done collaboratively by the Commission, the European Parliament, EU member states and NGOs through the use of tabletop exercises. Add language on cyber-surveillance risks to the Common Position user’s guide The new guidelines make frequent reference to Common Position 2008/944/CFSP and its user’s guide. While these documents are useful on issues of human rights and IHL, they do not specifically address issues relating to the use and misuse of cyber-surveillance tools. In order to improve the value and comprehensiveness of the user’s guide, the European Parliament could recommend revising it to cover both military items and items captured by the Dual-use Regulation and include detailed language on assessing risks associated with cyber-surveillance tools. This could be done as part of the currentreview of the Common Position, which is expected to conclude by the end of 2024. Build connections with other areas of policymaking Addressing the proliferation and misuse of cyber-surveillance tools is a complex challenge that cannot be achieved through any single policy instrument. Building on its 2023 inquiry to investigate the use of Pegasus and equivalent surveillance spyware, the European Parliament could push for the development of a common and coordinated EU approach for controlling not only the export but also the procurement and use of cyber-surveillance tools. In response to theEuropean Parliament’s recommendationsfollowing the inquiry, the Commission is currently working on adraft communicationthat will reportedly focus on addressing the possible misuse of cyber-surveillance tools at the national level. This communication and the publication of the Article 5 guidelines create the opportunity for a more coordinated set of policy responses at the EU level. As part of this approach, the EU should coordinate with theUSA-led initiative to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, which seeks to adopt a more comprehensive policy response. With support from the Open Society Foundations, the SIPRI Dual-Use and Ams Trade Control Programme is conducting a project focused on improving the implementation of export controls related to surveillance technologies.

Widening The War: The US Sends Troops To Israel – OpEd	The dangers should be plastered on every wall in every office occupied by a military and political advisor. Israel’s attempt to reshape the Middle East, far from giving it enduring security, will merely serve to make it more vulnerable and unstable than ever. In that mix and mess will be its greatest sponsor and guardian, the United States, a giant of almost blind antiquity in all matters concerning the Jewish state. In a measure that should have garnered bold headlines, the Biden administration has announced the deployment of some 100 US soldiers to Israel who will be responsible for operating the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. They are being sent to a conflict that resembles a train travelling at high speed, with no risk of stopping. As Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant promised in the aftermath of Iran’s October 1 missile assault on his country, 'Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising.' It would be of such a nature that 'They will not understand what happened and how it happened.' In an October 16 meeting between the Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Gallant, the deployment of a mobile THAAD battery was seen 'as an operational example of the United States’ ironclad support to the defense of Israel.' Largely meaningless bits of advice were offered to Gallant: that Israel 'continue taking steps to address the dire humanitarian situation' and take 'all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security' of UN peacekeepers operating in Lebanon’s south. The charade continued the next day in a conversation between Austin and Gallant discussing the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. THAAD was again mentioned as essential for Israel’s 'right to defence itself' while representing the 'United States’ unwavering, enduring, and ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.' ('Ironclad' would seem to be the word of the moment, neatly accompanying Israel’s own Iron Dome defence system.) A statement from the Pentagon press secretary, Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, was a fatuous effort in minimising the dangers of the deployment. The battery would merely 'augment Israel’s integrated air defense system,' affirm the ongoing commitment to Israel’s defence and 'defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks from Iran.' The very public presence of US troops, working alongside their Israeli counterparts in anticipation of broadening conflict, does not merely suggest Washington’s failure to contain their ally. It entails a promise of ceaseless supply, bolstering and emboldening. Furthermore, it will involve placing US troops in harm’s way, a quixotic invitation if ever there was one. As things stand, the US is already imperilling its troops by deploying them in a series of bases in Jordan, Syria and Iraq. Iran’s armed affiliates have been making their presence felt, harrying the stationed troops with increasing regularity since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7 last year. A gradual, attritive toll is registering, featuring such attacks as those on the Tower 22 base in northern Jordan in January that left three US soldiers dead. Writing in August for The Guardian, former US army major Harrison Mann eventually realised an awful truth about the mounting assaults on these sandy outposts of the US imperium: 'there was no real plan to protect US troops beyond leaving them in their small, isolated bases while local militants, emboldened and agitated by US support for Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, used them for target practice.' To send more aircraft and warships to the Middle East also served to encourage 'reckless escalation towards a wider war,' providing insurance to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could be protected 'from the consequences of his actions.' Daniel Davis, a military expert at Defense Priorities, is firmly logical on the point of enlisting US personnel in the Israeli cause. 'Naturally, if Americans are killed in the execution of their duties, there will be howls from the pro-war hawks in the West ‘demanding’ the president ‘protect our troops’ by firing back on Iran.' It was 'exactly the sort of thing that gets nations sucked into war they have no interest in fighting.' Polling, insofar as that measure counts, suggests that enthusiasm for enrolling US troops in Israel’s defence is far from warm. In results from a survey published by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations in August, some four in ten polled would favour sending US troops to defend Israel if it was attacked by Iran. Of the sample, 53% of Republicans would favour defending Israel in that context, along with four in 10 independents (42%), and a third of Democrats (34%). There have also been some mutterings from the Pentagon itself about Israel’s burgeoning military effort, in particular against the Lebanese Iran-backed militia, Hezbollah. In a report from The New York Times, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., is said to be worried about the widening US presence in the region, a fact that would hamper overall 'readiness' of the US in other conflicts. Being worried is just the start of it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8zFK0VLYUxLj	2024-10-19T17:16:26-07:00	
China’s Information War In Africa – Analysis	By Samir Bhattacharya and Yuvvraj Singh In 2014, during the Central Foreign Affairs meeting in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping advocated for strengthening China’s soft power globally by improving how the country communicates its message. In the subsequent years, Chinese state-controlled media focused on cultural investments and international cooperation, establishing marketing networks and expanding the reach of quality cultural assets abroad, particularly in Africa. China’s African outreach China’s information campaigns in Africa are subtle, focusing on economic issues and promoting apositive narrativearound its investments, mainly in the Belt and Road Initiative. State-controlled media outlets likeXinhua, China Daily, China Radio International (CRI), and CGTN(formerly CCTV International) play a vital role in this narrative. Meanwhile, StarTimes, a Chinese-owned media company, has become Africa’ssecond-largestdigital TV provider, with over 13 million digital TV and 20 million streaming subscribers. It has invested over US$2 billionin digital TV infrastructure across 30 African countries. Additionally, China actively produces documentaries to enhance its soft power, such as Africans in Yiwu, TAZARA: A Journey without an End, and Bobby’s Factory. For instance, the docuseries 'Bobby’s Factory' focuses on a Chinese factory owner in Africa and his positive interactions with local workers. Another series, 'TAZARA: A Journey without an End', highlights the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) project, a symbol of China-Africa cooperation under the broader umbrella of BRI. Consisting of three episodes, 'A Railway of Friendship', 'The Life Line', and 'Love for Tazara', the docuseries delves into the emotional connection of the railway line and how it positively impacted Tanzanian youth. Similarly, 'Africans in Yiwu-Chinese Meet Africa' depicts stories of hardworking and enterprising people living in Africa and their efforts to bridge the China-Africa gap. Finally, ‘My China Story’ features Africans sharing positive experiences from their time in China, further shaping a favourable image among younger generations. China’s information strategy in Africa China has adopted a three-pronged strategy in its information campaign in Africa. First, it hosts and trains numerous African media professionals each year, teaching them to promote Chinese investments as a positive force. Second, China invests in local African media outlets, influencing their editorial practices to align with the Chinese narrative. For example, StarTimes formed a joint venture with the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), securing a majority stake. Finally, China sells technology to African governments that enables tighter control over digital information, including blocking websites and shutting down internet access. During the 2020 Tigray Conflict in Ethiopia, for instance, Ethio Telecom used technology and expertise from Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE to suppress dissent and limit information flow. Chinese content frequentlydownplays local criticismsof its projects, such as labour disputes, environmental issues, and debt concerns, leading to a distorted view of Sino-African relations. DuringZambia’s 2016 elections, Chinese-owned and local media outlets portrayed Chinese investments as beneficial to Zambia’s future economy, favouring pro-China candidate Edgar Lungu. InKenya’s 2017 elections, China’s increasing role as an infrastructure financier was prominently featured. CGTN Africa portrayed the erstwhile President Uhuru Kenyatta as a symbol of modernity and progress, stressing his consent for projects like the Standard Gauge Railway while overlooking public concerns about sustainability and costs and minimising opposition critiques. In Zimbabwe,China has actively supported the ZANU-PFPolitical Party byrestricting civil societymovements and opposition and advancing narratives favourable to China’s interests in politics and business. In order to negotiate contracts and trade agreements, China also generates new narratives. Angola, a major oil producer, has received substantial Chinese infrastructure loans in exchange for future oil exports to China. Chinese media have framed these infrastructure projects as 'infrastructure-for-oil,' portraying them as vital for Angola’s recovery after decades of Civil War. This strategy has ultimately enabled China to gain long-term access to Angola’s oil reserves at favourable prices. Similar tactics were observed in Zambia, where the China Nonferrous Metal Mining Company (CNMC) secured a significant stake in Zambian copper mines, aided by favourable media coverage that overlooked labour issues and environmental concerns. Similarly, China established a presence at Djibouti’s Doraleh Multipurpose Port as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, downplaying worries about Djibouti’s increasing reliance on Chinese loans. Other strategically important projects, such as Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport and Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, allowed China to reap significant economic and geopolitical advantages by undermining debt concerns and promoting a pro-China narrative. China’s media influence under scrutiny Local perceptions are evolving as more and more African nations speak out against the adverse consequences of Chinese narrative-building.Hakainde Hichilema, the President of Zambia, has voiced concerns about the growing influence of foreign countries in the media, citing China, in particular, for shaping narratives and favouring specific perspectives. Similarly, Chinese investments and loans are frequently presented in an unduly flattering light, according toOby Ezekwesili, a former politician from Nigeria who is currently the Vice President of the World Bank Africa. Ezekwesili has questioned the lack of transparency in contracts granted to Chinese enterprises. She has alleged significant narrative control by Chinese-backed media. Concerns regarding Chinese-owned social media apps like TikTok are also growing because they are perceived to be susceptible to politically-driven actions. Several nations, like Senegal and Somalia,formally prohibitedthe app in 2023, claiming security and moral concerns. Others, including South Africa and Kenya, have petitioned againstWeChat and TikTok, among other apps. Controlling the narratives CCP’s investments in the African media landscape influence access to information and shape key narratives, although the impact of Chinese messaging remains mixed. Officials within African regimes are often more receptive to China’s governance model and messaging. However, ordinary Africans bear the brunt of this narrative battle, inundated with conflicting misinformation designed to sway public opinion and erode societal cohesion. There is an urgent need for awareness campaigns to educate these politicians about the long-term risks to their sovereignty.

Indonesia’s Tax Reforms Risk Being Undermined By Reckless Spendin...	By Yosephine Uliarta Indonesia’s tax-to-GDP ratio has beendeclining for over a decade, standing at 12.1 per cent in 2022 — just above Laos in ASEAN and well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3 per cent and the OECD average of 34 per cent. In response,tax reformshave been ongoing, with two major policies set to take effect soon —Core Tax Administration System (CTAS)by the end of 2024 and a potential value-added tax (VAT) rate increase in 2025. The long-awaited CTAS will modernise Indonesia’s tax system by integrating all tax processes into a unified platform, using accurate data to enhance oversight and improve collection. CTAS is expected to expand the tax base and increase efficiency by identifying new taxable objects and untapped revenue potential, improving compliance and making it easier to track income sources. Along with the introduction of aSingle ID for taxationin 2022, it will boost Indonesia’s low personal income tax (PIT) collection. Indonesia’stax revenue structurerelies heavily on corporate taxes (28.8 per cent) and VAT (28 per cent), while the contribution of PIT remains minimal (13 per cent).International trendsshow that countries with higher tax-to-GDP ratios typically generate a large share of revenue from PIT. Most PIT revenue in Indonesia comes from employees, whose taxes are automatically withheld by employers, while self-reported taxes from business owners, doctors and lawyers remain nonoptimal.The tax gap— the difference between potential and actual collections — was 42 per cent for overall PIT and a striking 80 per cent for non-employee income taxes in 2019. The small contribution of PIT is not unique to Indonesia. Due to limited capacity in collecting VAT,less developed countriesshould maximise revenue through easier-to-collect taxes, such as VAT, while continuing to reform PIT. VAT is harder to evade, making it a more reliable tool for revenue generation. Indonesia has already begun reforming its VAT system through the 2021 Tax Harmonization Law, which mandates a VAT rate increase from 11 to 12 per cent as early as 2025. This will bring Indonesia’s VAT rate closer to the OECD average (19 per cent) and global average (15.4 per cent). VAT is often criticised for being regressive —affecting lower-income households disproportionately. But this concern can be mitigated by strengthening targeted social assistance programs, offsetting the rate increase impact on lower-income groups. What matters ultimately is the overall distributional effect of the fiscal system, not just the impact of an isolated policy. Additionally, VAT is not imposed to basic necessities such as food, healthcare and education. While the VAT hike is necessary, the current economic downturn — marked bycontraction in the manufacturing sectoranddeclining consumer purchasing power— means raising VAT in 2025 could worsen financial pressures. Fortunately, the law includes flexibility, allowing the government to adjust the timing of the VAT increase according to economic conditions and providing the option to delay the hike if necessary. Indonesia is moving in the right direction with its tax reforms, but it’s important to recognise that much of the increased revenue from optimising personal income tax and VAT will come from the middle class. This group already bears asignificant tax burden, providing 42 per cent of indirect taxes (VAT and excises) and representing the majority of Indonesia’s income taxpayers. Naturally, they will expect public benefits and better governance in return for their contributions and their political importance cannot be underestimated. Tax reform success depends not just on raising revenue but on how well those funds are spent. Effective delivery of public goods builds support for higher taxes, while reckless spending erodes trust. Ideally, tax and expenditure reforms should go hand in hand, but this alignment is lacking in Indonesia. While revenue efforts are underway, several questionable spending plans risk undermining public support. The government’s plan to cut the Public Service Obligation (PSO) subsidy andadjust commuter train faresin greater Jakarta based on income levels could raise fares for the already financially strained middle class, despite the principle that public transport should serve all citizens equally. The president-elect’s proposal for a nationwide free school meal program has also raised concerns about itseffectivenessandfunding, which may divert essential resources from education and lower the education budget below legally required levels. More broadly,delays in budget disbursementand the failure to meet spending targets have historically undermined the effectiveness of public programs. These spending choices, along with the slow pace of disbursement, highlight a disconnect between tax reform efforts and the responsible, timely use of public funds. As Indonesia advances with its tax reforms, it is crucial to ensure these efforts aren’t undermined by reckless spending. A budget reveals a government’s true priorities, where policy goals meet the reality of implementation, determining how resources are raised and allocated. Responsible budgeting builds and sustains public trust. About the author: Yosephine Uliarta is a Master’s student at the Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University.

They Have The Money, We Have The Numbers – OpEd	Authoritarianism is back across the West — from Europe to the Biden-Harris censorship regime that would fit perfectly in Communist China. I think many of us were surprised during Covid to realize just what the supposedly liberal West has become: Essentially the Soviet Union but with better uniforms — well, better video games, anyway. Of course, it was decades in the making — Covid just showed their cards. The question, as always, is What’s Next.For better or worse, authoritarianism has happened many times in history — it’s kind of the human default. The original state. Humanity has a lot of experience with authoritarianism. So how did people protect themselves last time? Dodging Tyranny in the 1940s An elegant illustration is the 1940s, where essentially the entire globe went authoritarian socialist and then — as always — went to war. And the correct response very much depended on where you were. If you were in New York, you adjusted your stock portfolio. FDR’s 52nd birthday party, dressed as Caesar. The fasces bottom right is unintentionally apt. If you were in Britain you moved to the countryside and stockpiled canned food. If you were in Switzerland you packed a go-bag in case the German army decided to fill in the map. And if you were in Germany, of course, the only plan was to get the heck out. The problem is when to pull each trigger: When do you adjust the portfolio? Buy the canned food? Pack the go-bag? When do you get the heck out? Each of these preparations has a cost. And the more successful you are — the more you’ve built or achieved — the higher those costs go. Moving your family, your business, converting your career to location-independent where you can support your family. People ask why people didn’t leave Berlin before it was too late, and those costs are why. The good news is that this means the vast majority of us will stay and fight. I mean, true patriots will always stay and fight. But those mounting costs mean even apolitical people will fight. They will fight in proportion to the risk — because the cost rises with it. And they will fight in proportion to what they’ve built. That is, the people with the most to lose – the natural elite – are the most likely to stay. Every election since George W we’ve been treated to Hollywood liberals threatening to leave the country. You don’t hear influential people on the other side saying that. We will stay. The Bleaker It Gets, the Better Our Odds And stay we should. Because I know I’ve made this point repeatedly in videos, but we are going to win. Why? Partly tactical. They launched their takeover too soon. Because Covid fell into their lap, and they were still a generation away from the brainwashing it would take for a totalitarian takeover. Instead, the people rejected it. The Covid state left dangerous remnants, to be sure, that will become malignant if not excised. Still, it’s striking — perhaps unprecedented — the degree to which a totalitarian regime, once installed, was almost entirely removed. And the reason is encouraging: Because it polled atrociously — you may remember the Dems turning as one just after Biden assumed office. In other words, even with our shabby election infrastructure, they still fear the people. What remains post-Covid is an institutionalized left that has lost credibility with the majority. That is overextended, that has completely lost touch with the people. This loss of legitimacy means they are far weaker than pre-Covid. And Democracy is coming for them. Liberty’s Moment We’re already seeing the backlash with Trump surging in the polls, with Canada on deck next year, and European countries electing populists. Even more encouraging, if you zoom out rarely in history has liberty had so many advantages. Thanks to the internet — with a big assist from Elon. Of course, liberty starts out with the advantage that man is not by nature a slave. Slavery is an unstable equilibrium. It’s fragile. Just waiting for the right push. But this is up against the natural advantage of authoritarianism — it has the money. And money buys guns. It has the money because it seizes half of what you earn and uses it against you, then prints up whatever else it needs at the central bank. Then it uses that money to control the levers of society, from education to media to finance. We have the numbers, they have the money. Trust in Government Collapsing in Both Parties. What’s Next If it comes down to numbers vs money, our numbers are growing fast. Moreover, gloriously, the more they push the more we grow. Meaning they only have 2 options: pull back and hold on for dear life against the backlash. Or keep pushing and they’re out of power. It’s only a matter of time. In the 1970’s the great economist Murray Rothbard noted that you could fit the entire liberty movement in a New York living room. Now there are literally a billion of us. Forget a living room, we couldn’t fit in a state. Meanwhile their advantage – money – is collapsing before our eyes. Crashing in crippling debt, nervous financial markets, the limits of inflationary printing, and the moribund stagflation that always accompanies it. In short, we’re getting stronger. They’re getting weaker. And the longer it takes, the more spectacular will be our victory.

California’s Coastal Commission Ramps Up Partisan Zealotry – OpEd	In 2022, the California Coastal Commission (CCC)rejected the Poseidon desalination plantthat would have provided Orange County with 50 million gallons of fresh water a day. The CCC has now rejected a plan by the Space Force to boost the number of launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. This was allegedly based on environmental concerns, but the real reason recently came to light. In August, the commission asked the Space Force to monitor more closely howsonic booms affect southern sea otters, California red-legged frogs, the western snowy plover and the California least tern. Commissioner Kristina Kunkel worried that the CCC could be 'bullied into ignoring environmental protections' but by October it was apparent that the real problem wasSpaceX and its founder Elon Musk. 'Elon Musk is hopping about the country, spewing and tweeting political falsehoods,' claimed Commissioner Gretchen Newsom,political directorfor the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and not related to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The governor did appoint commissioner Mike Wilson, who is on the same page as commissioner Newsom. 'This company [SpaceX] is owned by the richest person in the world with direct control of what could be the most expansive communications system in the planet,' Wilson proclaimed, and 'just last week that person was talking about political retribution.' Commissioner Caryl Hart also targeted Musk, who builds Tesla electric cars. 'We’re dealing with a company, the head of which has aggressively injected himself into the presidential race,' proclaimed Hart, an attorney and author of a dissertation on 'California State Parks and Climate Change.' Hart wants SpaceX to apply for a coastal development permit issued by the Commission. Commissioner Susan Lowenberg is 'beyond pissed' and proclaims 'I don’t understand why our own government is thumbing their nose at another branch of our government.' Perhaps this is because the California Coastal Commission was not elected by the people of California. A 1972 ballot initiative created a temporary commission aimed at preventing environmental disasters, like the1969 oil spillnear Santa Barbara. The California Coastal Act of 1976, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, made the commission permanent. Since then the CCC has run roughshod over property rights, and ramped up corruption. As Californians might recall, when Hollywood celebrities sought permits for swimming pools and such, commissioner Mark Nathanson, appointed by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, hit them up for bribes. In 1993, Nathanson drew aprison sentenceof nearly five years for extortion. Under the command of regulatory zealots likelongtime director Peter Douglas, the commission blocked development and made coastal residency practically impossible for working people. The unelected CCC also projected its regulatory reach intotheme parks such as Sea Worldanddictated the rulesof surfing tournaments. The Poseidon Desalination Plant in Huntington Beach was in progress for 20 years and supported by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, including Gov. Newsom. The CCC turned it down with commissioner Dayna Bochco explaining that 'the ocean is under attack from climate change already.' Bochco is the wife of the late Steven Bochco and served as president of Steven Bochco Productions, producers of 'Doogie Howser MD,' 'Cop Rock' and other television shows. The CCC did approve theDoheny Ocean Desalination Plant, which will produce five million gallons of water a day, much less than the plant that got rejected. An unelected, unaccountable body thus prevents California from deriving maximum benefit from the Pacific Ocean, the state’s greatest natural resource. The commission now seeks to block Space Force launches because a majority of commissioners dislike Elon Musk. By now the lessons should be clear. The elected officials of California’s coastal cities and counties are fully capable of handling their own affairs and dealing with the Space Force. It is long past time to eliminate the Coastal Commission, a partisan political body that exists only to preserve its own power. Meanwhile, more than 50 years after the Santa Barbara oil spill, the greatest source of oil in the ocean is natural seepage from the ocean floor. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) natural seeps in Southern California addfive million gallonsto the ocean annually. In the Coal Oil Point area near Santa Barbara, 4,200 to 25,000 gallons of oil seep into the ocean per day. According to NOAA, the seeps have been leaking for 'thousands of years' and an oil seep is the possible cause of anoil sheen off Huntington Beachlast March.

Patrushev Using New Position To Promote Changes In Russian Naval ...	When Putin transferred Nikolay Patrushev from his position as secretary of the Russian Security Council and appointed him as a presidential assistant in charge of the restored Naval Collegium, many saw that as a clear demotion and even suggested it might cause Putin to challenge Putin. Those suggestions (cf. windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/06/putins-recent-personnel-moves-threaten.html and have overshadowed and distracted attention from a more important development. As Vzglyad commentator Aleksandr Timokhin argues, Patrushev has used his new position to promote the rebuilding of Russian naval and merchant marine capacity and to lead Putin to adopt a far more aggressive stance against the West on the world’s oceans (vz.ru/society/2024/10/17/1292275.html). Indeed, he implies, Patrushev may have emerged from his supposed demotion in an even stronger position and one with more immediate and troubling consequences to the West than even his sometimes paranoid denunciations of what he sees the West as doing inside Russia (e.g., jamestown.org/program/kremlin-worried-about-ukrainian-wedges-inside-russia/ and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/08/newly-elevated-naval-collegium-to.html). In his new position, Patrushev has been working to overcome three major obstacles to Russia’s becoming a major naval power: the longstanding Russian focus on the army rather than the navy as the basis of its strength, serious problems in Russian shipbuilding, and the paucity of exercises that can serve to intimidate others by highlighting Russia’s strength in this area. As Timokhin notes, these three problems have combined to lead to the decline of the Russian fleet since Soviet times, leaving the country’s navy with only approximately a quarter of the ships in the Armenian navy and meaning that there is not a single book in recent times on the uses of the Russian fleet in non-nuclear conflicts with the West. Putin has put Patrushev in this position to overcome these problems, the commentator continues; and Patrushev has the knowledge and energy to achieve far more in this regard than the Russian naval leadership has achieved in recent decades, putting it on course to be far better able to respond to and challenge the navies of the West.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i88We9OTyuil5	2024-10-19T16:49:27-07:00	
ASEAN Must Reform Or Face Decay – Analysis	ASEAN has a long and rich history, but its main tenets and essence of its self-induced mantra of principles have many times failed to spark new confidence in bracing for the tough challenges to come. The recently concluded ASEAN Summit and Related Summits in Vientiane have also portrayed the same old trappings within the entity and beyond exposing the deep lying structural and systemic loopholes and internal weaknesses that have over the decades slowed progress and frustrated many within and without, over the road not taken. The division within ASEAN has weakened unity and collective resolve, giving other powers the advantage of dealing with member states individually rather than with ASEAN as a whole. Previous mechanisms, such as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DoC) and efforts to accelerate the Code of Conduct (CoC) process, are seen as only preventive frameworks that establish guardrails and norms of behavior in the South China Sea. These mechanisms do not directly address the resolution of disputes but merely ensure that behaviours in the contested zones adheres to an agreed code of ethics and procedures, relying on the goodwill of involved states to follow norms and exercise self-restraint. However, the core issues remain unresolved, particularly the need for compliance with international law and maritime law, ensuring that actions do not exceed agreed-upon limits. These laws serve as the foundation for peace, stability, and behavior, based on the rule of law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, in line with international law. They should not be interpreted according to historical perspectives or individual viewpoints. The focus should be on deepening ties with other equally, if not more, important powers in the region especially India and Australia apart from the traditional and conventional powers that have been relied upon in trade, economic development and technological advancement and inflow. Existing economic, trade and people to people ties that have been robust with Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul must also be enhanced to have the long term spillover impact on matters of greater priorities and areas of high politics, transitioning from low politics. Defence and security ties with Seoul and Tokyo present a vast opening for solidification, with Tokyo's OSA and RAA initiatives providing a more reliable fallback defence and deterrent capacities for the region and the country, apart from aligning with the arch of democracies that will stand ready to defend the rules based order. Structural and Systemic Limitations Old conventional approaches of ASEAN have seen ASEAN losing its relevance, strength and leverage to negotiate and fast becoming obsolete. New strategic moves to strengthen internal unity and capacity must also rely on the manoeuvre and political will to escape from past practices and limitations and to gain further weight and leverage in diversifying trade and economic dependence on the major neighbouring economic power and to lessen the baggage and strings involved, and also in increasing the bargaining chips and greater internal security and defence capacities by having more fallback options with the inclusion of new powers that have been neglected in the past, including Russia and India to be seen as the needed third force in the region both in defence and economic presence. Within ASEAN, there is a clear division in addressing this issue and in the response to China's actions, particularly between Manila and other actors. This division has created gaps in the collective approach to positioning ASEAN as a united entity in negotiations and dialogue with China. Manila has expressed frustration with ASEAN and other member states for not supporting its firm stance and physical responses in dealing with Chinese Coast Guard actions, which have led to the risk of confrontation. Other claimants within ASEAN prefer to continue using existing mechanisms to engage with China, aiming to avoid high-intensity confrontations and the risk of retaliation in other areas. Addressing the South China Sea disputes will also require considering potential future claims and changes, not just relying on the CoC or ASEAN's strategic hedging, balancing, or neutrality as a way out. Changes in global power dynamics and the concept of total power will alter the balance of economic and military capabilities, and it is not guaranteed that current dominant economic and military powers will maintain their strength in the future. ASEAN risks irrelevance and being obsolete unless it can jettison its past conventional trap of being a mere balancing entity and a bridge to appease both sides. It needs to make its stance loud and clear,which is to steadfastly align with, and protect the universal principles of the rules based order,the sanctity of international law and maritime law and in safeguarding the interests of each member's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It cannot continue being limited by its overwhelming focus on trade and economic returns without parallel focus on securing the stability, peace and international order in the region and in protecting each member's vulnerabilities and addressing their concerns. Internal economic and development divide has been ingrained, alongside weak internal cohesion on fundamental security concerns, with rising arms races and security dilemma. These core gaps and structural and systemic loopholes will first need serious regional political will to ensure that Asean remains relevant in the future, especially in moving away from its systemic trap of an ineffective security and economic provider and the inability to project wider global influence and escaping its middle powership projection. New Opening for New Reform Malaysia is expected to continue with the policy direction of maintaining strategic hedging and balancing between the two blocs of power, without risking economic and security ties with both China and the US. The concept of independence in foreign policymaking and neutrality is expected to continue with dependence on other emerging powers within the Global South, especially with India, the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America and Africa on economic and trade diversification and also in strengthening supply chain and energy and food security and in boosting friendshoring efforts. All said, Malaysia will also expect to continue to strengthen defence and security fallback which will be important to the country in facing renewed threat settings and a volatile region, and will also not risk existing good ties in defence and security with the other power bloc. Malaysia's role as Chair of ASEAN provides a critical and strategic platform for leading the region and shaping new approaches to resolving the conflict in the South China Sea. In line with ASEAN's mantra of non-alignment and strategic hedging and balancing, Malaysia is expected to continue to steer the regional grouping towards this line of approach in dealing with both the West and China, taking into account past mechanisms and also calculating on future changes of possible risks and tensions and the need for continued adherence to decades old mechanism of ASEAN being the primary bridge and balancing role between both sides of the bloc. Concurrently, it is expected for ASEAN under the Malaysian leadership to expand and deepen the role of ASEAN in engaging with immediate neighbouring powers including the current set up of ASEAN + 3 and related Summits and cooperative domains, and also including new players including in South Asia, Middle East and Central Asia. The Need to Preserve the Rules Based Order The CoC will also not fundamentally solve the core contentious claim of the CoC, as it merely provides rules and guidelines on the conduct in the zones,and not providing conclusive judgment of the jurisdictions. As such, ASEAN must push for a concrete plan for upholding the agreed upon adherence to universal norms and the international law and maritime rules, and the freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters, all of which have formed the main basis of international peace and order since WWII, and that the region cannot afford to tolerate attempts to alter the rules based order which will disjoint the entire ecosystem of equality and common status under the rule of law and abiding by the UN Charter. The global system and other countries, as well as the UN, will continue to defend and support ASEAN's position and principles on this issue. This creates a critical platform for strengthening ASEAN's options and power, looking beyond the CoC, ASEAN TAC, SEANWFZ, or ASEAN-China dialogue as conventional conflict prevention mechanisms, while building new capacity without jeopardizing formal relations or ties with external powers. Therefore, the universal system that has maintained global peace and stability since WWII, such as the UN Charter and international law, must be the foundation and provide legitimacy for claimant states and ASEAN. This will serve as the most critical platform and a strong moral standing for asserting sovereignty without disrupting existing relationships, as these foundational principles provide a conviction of legitimacy and a rules-based moral standing. In this context, Malaysia has the opportunity to craft a new narrative, vision, and strategy to steer ASEAN toward a new nucleus of unity, based on the principles of a universal rules-based order, freedom of navigation, and respect for the sanctity of international law and the international law of the sea. This would send a clear message that ASEAN is no longer bound by the old framework, which is seen as weak and overly dependent on external economic pressures and influences. This new direction also demands a fresh concept of conflict deterrence, based on universal and holistic approaches that enhance internal capacity in the domain of hard power deterrence, economic resilience, and diversification of economic dependencies, along with a strong fallback option. Collectively, this will strengthen individual countries and ASEAN's ability to defend regional interests, sovereignty, and peace without compromising official and diplomatic relations with other powers. In a new era of rising autocratic tendencies and policies that have further worsened the risks of conflicts and miscalculations and weakened the fabric of international order based on rule of law and international norms, all free nations and the arch of democracy must not fail the world, in standing in solidarity to defend the beacon of freedom and democracy. Failure to do that will signal a historical misjudgment and mistake in preserving and saving the hard fought freedom and democracy and a rules based order that have preserved global peace for more than seven decades since WWII, and will allow unchecked aggression that will threaten peace anywhere. ASEAN therefore remains a critical forefront in this overall economic and security stability based on values and norms, and defending the freedom in the Indo Pacific will mean defending the freedom of the entire world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8xq1HFiqsCw3	2024-10-19T16:29:51-07:00	
Canada’s Vote Bank Politics: Domestic Compulsion And Foreign Poli...	Sri Lanka and India have become victims of Canada's ethnic vote bank politics. 'Vote bank politics' is a South Asian term which refers to the cultivation of a community to secure their votes. In some cases, a blind eye is turned to undesirable elements, like terrorists, among these communities. Such a blind spot may lead to domestic as well as international problems. Canadian political parties attempt to get the support of various ethnic groups living in Canada. This cannot be deemed objectionable as it is mandated by democratic electoral politics. But in the case of the Sri Lankan Tamil and the Sikh ethnic groups in Canada, political parties' vote bank politics has had direct implications for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and India. Sri Lanka On May 21 this year, the Sri Lankan government hit out at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for engaging in electoral 'vote bank' politics by making an 'outrageous allegation' about 'genocide' during the island nation's brutal armed conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that ended in 2009. Sri Lanka pointed out that the LTTE has been banned in 33 countries other than Sri Lanka. 'Canada's falsification of our history amounts to irresponsible disinformation. It misleads the minds of current and future generations in Canada and elsewhere, encouraging and perpetuating hatred. It empowers extremism on all sides in all parts of the world where such messages are easily and instantaneously transmitted including through social media. We therefore urge the Canadian Government to assume responsibility in a spirit of mutual respect in promoting peace and harmony',' the government's statement said. 'Canada's disproportionate focus on Sri Lanka is a clear example of double standards.While Canada has opted to support a false narrative regarding the conflict in Sri Lanka, it has remained intentionally ambiguous relating to the daily dire humanitarian situations we see elsewhere. It is crucial that countries like Canada, who claim to be global advocates of human rights, recognize their self-interested double standards which are resulting in increased polarization in the international community.' 'Clearly, the repeated statements by the Prime Minister of Canada with regard to Sri Lanka are the outcome of electoral vote bank politics in Canada, funded by a small number of Canadians of Sri Lankan origin with vested and personal interest,' Sri Lanka's statement said. India Earlier this month, the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau accused the Indian government of assassinating a wanted Sikh terrorist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil and expelled six Indian diplomats including High Commissioner Ramesh Kumar Verma. India described the charge as 'preposterous' and accused Trudeau of doing 'vote bank' politics. New Delhi also expelled the top most Canadian diplomat in residence and six others. Canada is a multi-ethnic country in which Sikhs and Sri Lankan Tamils have for long been an important part. The Sikh population is about 770,000 and the Sri Lankan Tamil population is about 240,000. The Sikhs even have a political party the National Democratic Party (NDP) with a significant presence in parliament. The Tamils have no political party but have influential lobbyists in parliament and outside. Sikhs have a reputation for being much more politically engaged than other Diaspora communities in Canada. The Sikh vote is a significant factor in elections. The White Canadian political parties enter into alliance with the ethnic groups or ethnic parties or uphold their demands for electoral gain.Trudeau's Liberal Party has been doing the same. It had an alliance with the NDP, which subsequently broke. Yet, Trudeau continued to cultivate the Sikhs turning a blind eye to those in the community who were actively advocating a separate Sikh country called Khalistan carved out of India. Canadian political scientist Roy Norton points out that over the decades, White Canadian participation in party politics has been declining and the participation of certain Diaspora communities, especially Sikhs, has been rising. In many parliamentary constituencies, the Diaspora communities could tilt the outcome one way or the other. Hence their growing importance for the mainstream White parties. And Diaspora communities in Canada prioritize foreign policy objectives ahead of other concerns, Norton points out. This is where the rub is. The result is that Canadian political leaderships are unwilling to accept even 'reasonable' requests from the Governments of India or Sri Lanka. Though only a section of Sikhs or Tamils are supportive of an independent Khalistan or Tamil Eelam, Canadian political leadersfear losing the entire Sikh or Tamil vote if they do not endorse the demand of the minority. India's Outburst A statement released by India's External Affairs Ministry on October 14, blasted Trudeau of indulging in vote bank politics without nay regard for India's territorial integrity. On the action taken against the Indian High Commissioner in the case relating to the assassination of Sikh terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Indian government said: 'This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.' 'Prime Minister Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard.' 'That his Government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters.' 'Under criticism for turning a blind eye to foreign interference in Canadian politics, his Government has deliberately brought in India in an attempt to mitigate the damage.' 'This latest development targeting Indian diplomats is now the next step in that direction. It is no coincidence that it takes place as Prime Minister Trudeau is to depose before a Commission on foreign interference. It also serves the anti-India separatist agenda that the Trudeau Government has constantly pandered to for narrow political gains.' 'To that end, the Trudeau Government has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada. This has included death threats to them and to Indian leaders. All these activities have been justified in the name of freedom of speech.' 'Some individuals who have entered Canada illegally have been fast-tracked for citizenship. Multiple extradition requests from the Government of India in respect of terrorists and organized crime leaders living in Canada have been disregarded.' Row with Trudeau Goes Back to 2018 International relations expert C.Raja Mohan noted that in most countries, especially democracies, 'the cultivation of narrowly-based domestic constituencies for electoral reasons has its unfortunate consequences for the conduct of foreign policy.' Recalling the 2018 visit to India by Trudeau, Raja Mohan noted thatPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who is more than eager to serenade visiting leaders in his home state of Gujarat, did not travel to Ahmedabad to be with Trudeau. Despite repeated efforts, including at the highest political levels, to flag the question of Sikh separatism in Canada, Trudeau was reluctant to address India's concerns. There was speculation as to whether Trudeau would meet the Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh who was on the hit list of the Sikh terrorists. He did not what to meet Amarinder Singh. But according toIndian Expresshe did meet Amarinder Singh after he was told that his plane would not be allowed to land in Amritsar if he did not agree to meet the Chief Minister. Raja Mohan correctly predicted in 2018 that Trudeau's visit, instead of putting aside the Khalistan issue, would aggravate the differences with India. And that was evident in 2023 and 2024. Political scientist Roy Norton found that radicals seeking overt Canadian government support for the dismemberment of a generally friendly country have always failed. But Canadian governments would not interfere with peaceful, law-abiding actions by segments of any Diaspora community, or by any Canadians, supporting human/democratic rights abroad. Ottawa complains that New Delhi and Colombo do not understand this democratic practice. Norton also noted that, in contrast to the past, foreign governments have begun to act on Canadian soil against Canadian citizens who they consider threatening to their interests. Verbal protests have been substituted by action on the ground. The assassination of Sikh terrorist Nijjar allegedly by Indian agents in June 2023 is an example.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i8ynuBJxanUmg	2024-10-19T16:25:08-07:00	
China Undermines Its Interests By Boosting Support For Myanmar’s ...	By Zachary Abuza China borders 14 countries, tied with Russia for the most in the world, and Beijing takes great pains to ensure the security of its interests and defend against conflicts from spilling over. Despite that, China’s Myanmar policy is based on faulty assumptions and is undermining its own interests. China’s policy since the February 2021 coup – which Beijing simply labeled a change in government – has never been good. Nonetheless, it refrained from offering initial support for the State Administrative Council (SAC), as the junta formally calls itself, and put pressure on them not to ban the National League for Democracy, which they ultimately did in March 2023. For the first two years, Beijing clearly hedged their bets. But since then, the Chinese have doubled down on the junta. China continues tosell weapons, and there is evidence that Chinese technicians are working in Myanmar’sdefense industries. There is clearly some technology sharing. A new shell designed for drone warfare is a copy of a Chinese-produced munition. At the same time, China had initially held the junta at arms length diplomatically. They have never invited Min Aung Hlaing to China, including to the poorly attended third Belt and Road Initiative summit in October 2023. While China invited the junta’s deputy commander, Soe Win, in July 2024, it was only in a multilateral setting. China has both supported ASEAN’s decision to keep Myanmar’s representation at the non-political level, but also the Thai-ledTrack 1.5 initiativeto engage the junta. China’s primary concern has been the protection of its economic interests, in particular their parallel oil and gas pipelines in Myanmar and theWanbao copper mine. Another priority for China was the development of their special economic zone in the Rakhine state port of Kyaukphyu. Beijing has long been frustrated with theslow implementationof the project, which includes rail and road links to the Chinese border. Although they were able to negotiate further concessions from the diplomatically isolated junta, the project continues to stall. Rebels control borders, resources But since the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a trio of ethnic armies that have received various degrees of support from China over the years, launched an offensive against the military regime called Operation 1027 a year ago, there’s been a hardening of China’s position, in line with the junta’s losses. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, which includes the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Arakan Army, and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), as well as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), now controls all but one of the major border crossings to China. There has been some $9 billion in cross border trade since the 2021 coup. While this is not huge in terms of China’s overall trade, it matters to Yunnan province, especially in the context of slowing economic growth. And for the sanctioned junta with dire shortages of foreign exchange, border trade is a financial lifeline. China recently shut down five border gates, in order to punish the opposition which continues their offensive against the military. The government in Yunnan has cut electricity and internet service in the enclave of Kokang to further pressure the MNDAA. But facts on the ground are changing. China now must contend with the reality that 90% of Myanmar’s natural resources, including jade and rare earth minerals, are now either controlled by opposition forces or are in contested areas. Chinese hydroelectric dams are now under the control of non-state actors in Shan state, while the KIA is moving in on Chinese backed dams in Kachin. Other Chinese investments arenow in opposition-controlled territories, and they must now pay taxes to the shadow National Unity Government (NUG) or to ethnic resistance organizations. While the Arakan Army (AA) has not taken Kyaukphyu, it controls all the surrounding territory in Rakhine state. Any development of the special economic zone requires negotiations with them. The capture ofAnn Townshipwould give the AA control over a pipeline pumping station. AA control of the territory surrounding the port city of Sittwe forced the Indian government to reevaluate their Myanmar policy and engage the Arakan Army and NUG. China is digging in their heels. Signs of Chinese frustration Since Operation 1027 began last October 27, China has continued the transfer of weaponry to the junta. In August, the military took possession of six additionalFTC-2000G jet trainers, produced by Guizhou Aviation Industries, a division of the large military conglomerate AVIC. While air power alonecan punish civilians, it cannot hold territory, a task that is increasingly beyond the reach of the junta military. Despite at least six intakes of conscripts, adding an estimated 30,000 troops, the new forces are hastily trained, inadequately equipped, and poorly motivated. Some 300 junta troops surrendered in northwestern Sagaing region early this month after nearly one month of fighting. The military was simply unable to resupply them and other forces deployed to far-flung outposts around the country. Peoples’ Defense Force militias and ethnic armies are now routinely targeting the army’s riverine transportation. Demoralized soldiers are voting with their feet andsurrendering. The military launched a counter-offensiveto retake territory lost since Operation 1027 began. While they have made limited inroads, they’ve been against priority urban targets, such as Laukkaing in Shan State’s Kokang region. A leaked document from a July meeting between China's special envoy for Myanmar, Deng Xijun, and the powerful United Wa State Army rebel group, laid bare Beijing’s frustration that the Three Brotherhood Alliance refuses to stop its offensive. China’s concerns about the potential fall of the junta are palpable. China has since also pressured the MNDAA to distance itself from the tripartite alliance and publicly state that it would notcoordinate actionswith the NUG. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveled to Naypyitaw to pledge additional financial assistance to the junta, prompting the NUG to issue a stern warning that debts incurred by an illegal government will not be honored by a future democratic government. Willfully ignorant It is for this reason alone that China has been calling for elections. Beijing sees these both as an offramp and as a way for the military to maintain its political influence in a post-conflict government. Deng and Beijing’s new ambassador to Myanmar, Ma Jia, appear to be willfully ignorant about the degree to which the people of Myanmar hold China in contempt for propping up the military, giving them the weaponry to intensify their aerial attacks on civilian populations, and for searching for ways for the military to prolong their disastrous political interference. China is clearly on the wrong side of history. Chinese diplomats and intelligence analysts are not stupid people. So why are they getting this one so wrong? In part, it’s because of their ideology and analytical blinders. As an authoritarian regime, China can’t imagine a fellow authoritarian regime failing, especially one that they back. But it’s also wishful thinking driven by fear. China, as a statist regime, is highly uncomfortable with the idea of a messy federal democracy on its borders. So for now Beijing is backing the junta, which, despite every advantage in resources and military capabilities, has fallen under the weight of its own incompetence, avarice and delusional thinking. Beijing believes that a corrupt and pliable Myanmar government that includes the military will best serve Chinese interests. At the same time, the NUG and their allies will never accept elections or a negotiated settlement with the junta, who haveproven themselves to be untrustworthy. Giving the junta a seat at the table gives them yet another opportunity to kick the forces of democracy and federalism in the teeth. The people of Myanmar have fought too hard and suffered too much to accept that. Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

Italian Court Rules Migrants Shipped To Albania Must Be Sent Back	By Fjori Sinoruka A court in Rome on Friday ordered the transfer back to Italy of 12 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt who were intercepted at sea and then transported to a reception centre in Albania under a controversial new scheme backed by Italy and Albania’s premiers. The court said that it was impossible to assess whether they came from a 'safe country of origin' and so they have a right to have their asylum claims processed in Italy. The decision was based on a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which concluded that a country of origin cannot be assessed as 'safe' if parts of it are not – a decision that could have a major impact on the Italy-to-Albania offshoring project. The court ruling can be appealed and it is so far unclear when the migrants will be returned to Italy. The first Italian military ship holding 16 migrants arrived in Albania on Wednesday. However, four migrants were sent back to Italy the same day; two of them because they were minors and two other for health reasons, according to media reports. Italy unveiled its plan to send refugees and migrants intercepted by its navy at sea to processing centres in Albania was unveiled in November last year by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni. The scheme has been criticised in both countries by activists and human rights lawyers who question Albania’s capacities to handle the arrangements. But the deal received the green light from Albania’s Constitutional Court in January. According to the agreement, Italy is covering all the construction and equipment costs. The arrangement is supposed to operate along the same lines as Italy’s repatriation 'hotspots', where migrants and refugees are detained pending repatriation, but which the European Court of Human Rights criticised in March.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcQiE7XWX1i85z-NZWV9yh7	2024-10-19T16:13:02-07:00
