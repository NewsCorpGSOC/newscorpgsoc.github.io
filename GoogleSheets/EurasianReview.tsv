Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) – Analysis	By Jennifer DiMascio Background The U.S. Army is developing the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) to serve as a next-generation aircraft for vertical lift, air assault, maritime interdiction, aeromedical evacuation, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, and tactical resupply. The Army intends for FLRAA to eventually replace the Sikorsky UH- 60 Black Hawk medium-utility helicopter, which was designed more than 50 years ago. Army Futures Command Commanding General James E. Rainey testified that the Army needs FLRAA to have the ability to fly twice as far and twice as fast as previous rotorcraft, a capability he called essential for operations in the Pacific region. The Army is under contract with Textron Bell to build a FLRAA prototype of its V-280 demonstrator aircraft. The Administration has asked Congress for $1.26 billion for FLRAA research, development, test, and evaluation in FY2025 (see Table 1). UH-60 Black Hawk The Army plans to begin operating FLRAA in the 2030s and, in the meantime, continue to purchase Black Hawk helicopters. According to Army budget documents, the UH- 60M is 'the Army’s utility helicopter for the near and midterm force,' supporting maneuver commanders in airassault, general support command and control, and aeromedical evacuation. The Administration’s FY2025 budget request proposes continuing the purchase of 24 Black Hawks annually under a five-year contract that began in 2022 and ends in 2026. The service may also follow through on another multiyear proposal to purchase up to 255 UH-60s from FY2027 to FY2031. The Black Hawk is operated by at least 35 governments. Future Vertical Lift FLRAA is one component of the Army’s plan—launched in 2009—to modernize its aviation assets. That Army effort, called Future Vertical Lift (FVL), focused on replacing Cold War-era aircraft with rotorcraft that could fly more supplies, faster, for longer distances, more reliably, and with less logistical support. That plan took on even greater relevance as the U.S. military turned its attention to potential conflict with China and Russia, which have advanced air defenses that would force the United States to operate at longer ranges. Under FVL, the Army had intended to develop FLRAA, a Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), and two new Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) programs. The Army proposed canceling FARA in its FY2025 budget request. The Army plans for FLRAA’s and FVL’s UASprograms to continue. (See CRS In Focus IF12592, Army Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Program Proposed Cancellation: Background and Issues for Congress, by Jennifer DiMascio.) To achieve 'transformational increases in speed, range, and maneuverability,' the Army is seeking FLRAA, an aircraft that would cruise at speeds of up to 280 knots—compared with the Black Hawk’s cruising speed of 151 knots. The Army states FLRAA should fly with up to 12 passengers for at least 1,700 nautical miles (nm) without refueling. FLRAA should be able to fly at altitudes of 6,000 ft., and up to 95-degree heat. In 2014, the Army awarded initial contracts to Bell and a Sikorsky-Boeing team, marking the start of a FLRAA competition. Each team produced a demonstrator, from which the Army could select a vendor that would produce an eventual prototype aircraft. Bell developed a V-280 Valor demonstrator, which flew for the first time in December 2017. Sikorsky and Boeing built the SB-1 Defiant X demonstrator, a compound helicopter that uses twin coaxial rotors for lift and a pusher propeller to generate speed. The Defiant flew for the first time in March 2019. In 2022, the Army awarded a $1.3 billion contract to Bell Textron to deliver by 2025 a digital FLRAA prototype based on the firm’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor aircraft. Sikorsky challenged the contract award, but the Government Accountability Office (GAO) upheld the Army’s decision, citing Sikorsky’s failure to adequately address a requirement for a modular open system architecture (MOSA) that would allow for faster, easier software upgrades. Congress in the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2017 and 2021 (P.L. 114-328 §805 and P.L. 116- 283 §804) required major defense acquisition programs to adopt a MOSA approach. Bell V-280 The V-280 uses a tiltrotor design. Tiltrotors can take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then tilt their rotor blades forward to fly like an airplane. The U.S. Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force operate another tiltrotor aircraft, the V-22 Osprey. Bell chose a more conventional design for the V-280 compared with the V-22, according to an industry official. For example, the clutch design on the V-280 is simpler, and the V-280 has a straight wing, which eliminates the need for the kind of mid-wing gearbox that exists on the V-22. Bell has teamed with Rolls-Royce on a propulsion system for the V-280: two Rolls-Royce AE1107F turboshafts, the same engine as the V-22. Other FLRAA subcontractors include Spirit AeroSystems (composite fuselage); Safran (landing gear); Moog (flight-control computers and other components); GE Aerospace (common open architecture, digital backbone, voice and data recorder, and health awareness system); and Astronics Corporation Electrical (power and distribution system). Program Status The Army says its FY2025 budget request would fund activities for FLRAA engineering and management and development. Among other things, the funds would continue development of a digital backbone with an underlying structure that meets the Army’s MOSA objectives. As stated above, the Army prioritized an open system approach to the FLRAA program to ease future sustainment, facilitate software upgrades, and connect more easily with other sensors and weapons. In May 2024, the Army designated FLRAA as a 'pathfinder program,' one that would set an example for how to implement digital engineering to achieve those goals. U.S. Special Operations Command has reportedly contributed to design discussions and requested the FLRAA include space on the aircraft to house a specialized radar in the nose, add hardware for a refueling probe, and other modifications. On August 2, 2024, the Army announced that FLRAA had entered the Milestone B engineering and manufacturing development phase, following a successful preliminary design review in April and an Army Systems Acquisition Review Council meeting in June. The service said the Milestone B decision allowed the Army to exercise the first of nine contract options, including the detailed design and build of six prototype aircraft. The first FLRAA prototype flight is planned for 2026. Low-rate initial production would then follow in 2028, with initial fielding of aircraft planned for 2030. FLRAA Funding The House-passed version of the FY2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the FY2025 NDAA, and versions of the FY2025 Defense Appropriations Act passed by the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommend fully funding the Administration’s request for FLRAA research, development, test, and evaluation in FY2025. Considerations for Congress Oversight by Congress may include the following: Army officials have stated that future attack aircraft should be flown without humans in the cockpit. Other industry officials say that human pilots will always have a role on the battlefield. Members of Congress could conduct hearings or discussions about the need for human pilots, which could affect the future of the FLRAA program. Congress may continue oversight of experimental efforts for FLRAA to work with other platforms, including Air-Launched Effects. ALE could be a swarm of small UAS that could provide surveillance, target tracking, jamming, or communications to expand the FVL’s ability to operate in contested environments. The Army is continuing to manufacture UH-60 Black Hawks for its own use and use by foreign governments. Members of Congress may consider the feasibility and budgetary implications of modernizing the Black Hawk alongside the creation of the new FLRAA platform. Some Members have expressed concern about the choice of a tiltrotor aircraft, pointing to recent fatal accidents involving V-22 Osprey aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee in S.Rept. 118-204 'encourages' Army officials in charge of aviation to collaborate with Navy officials on lessons learned about development and operation of tiltrotor aircraft that might be applied to the FLRAA. Congress may examine whether or not that has taken place and what resulted. Congress also may consider oversight of whether FLRAA meets the Navy’s needs for a Future Vertical Lift-Maritime Strike platform.

Tajikistan’s Afghan Conundrum – Analysis	By Bruce Pannier (FPRI) -- Tajikistan’s policies toward neighboring Taliban-ruled Afghanistan are reaching a pivotal moment. Tajik President Emomali Rahmon and his government have always viewed the Taliban as a threat, and that position has not changed since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. However, there is a bigger threat to Tajikistan growing in Afghanistan, and it might take cooperation with the Taliban to neutralize it. Additionally, the other Central Asian countries and China, Iran, and Russia are engaging with the Taliban government. Tajikistan risks missing out on opportunities that these countries are opening in Afghanistan. Following the lead of these countries presents Tajikistan with a different set of problems. Tajik authorities have been warning the country’s people and the international community about the Taliban threat for nearly 30 years. Tajikistan’s rigid stance against the Taliban government has brought Rahmon’s government support from Tajikistan’s people and other countries. Making peace with the Taliban will be difficult to explain to Tajik citizens. It will also remove one of the greatest incentives for foreign governments to continue decades of generous financial and security support for Rahmon’s government. Enemies from the Start President Rahmon is unique among the current leaders of countries bordering Afghanistan. He is the only leader who was in power when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, all the Central Asian presidents, except the Turkmen president, viewed the Taliban as a threat and shunned any contact with them. Rahmon’s government and the government of Uzbekistan’s then-President Islam Karimov aided ethnic Tajik and Uzbek groups fighting the Taliban in northern Afghanistan. The potential danger from the Taliban was acutely felt in Tajikistan where there was civil war from 1992 to 1997. The Rahmon government’s battlefield opponent was the United Tajik Opposition, a coalition of groups in which the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) was the backbone. In the early years after the Taliban appeared, most people knew little about the group except that they were Islamic extremists. Rahmon had reason to be one of the strongest critics of the Taliban. Other governments alarmed at the Taliban’s advance through Afghanistan also saw that Tajikistan, the poorest Central Asian country emerging from a five-year civil war, needed assistance to ensure the Taliban could not find a foothold or sympathizers inside Tajikistan. The Taliban and other militant groups continued operating in northern Afghanistan after foreign forces entered the country. Tajikistan became a frontline in the war on terror, and Rahmon realized that warning about threats from Afghanistan prompted countries and organizations to send additional finances and security assistance. His continued opposition to the Taliban after August 2021 earned Rahmon invitations to visit the European Parliament and France in October 2021. A Safer Border Tajikistan’s government is slowly opening ties with the Taliban. The first reported contact occurred after militants from the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) launched several rockets from northern Afghanistan into Tajikistan on May 7, 2022. Former Tajik security officer Samariddin Chuyanzoda traveled to Kabul on May 14 to meet with Taliban representatives. The Taliban were facing sporadic attacks from ISK before foreign troops departed Afghanistan, and those attacks continue to this day. The Taliban claim that, among the ISK militants they have killed or captured in the last three years, some are citizens of Tajikistan. Just weeks before Chuyanzoda made his trip to Kabul, ISK increased its recruiting propaganda in the Tajik language, targeting Tajiks in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. There are also the militants of Jamaat Ansarullah, a terrorist group originating in Tajikistan that allied themselves with the Taliban during the final years foreign forces were in Afghanistan. During the first months after the Taliban’s recapture of Afghanistan when the Tajik government and Taliban were exchanging threats, the Taliban stationed Jamaat Ansarullah militants, freshly armed with US weapons seized by the Taliban when they took control of Afghanistan. According to reports in February 2024, Tajik and Taliban officials met at the request of Tajikistan toward the end of 2023 to discuss what to do with the Jamaat Ansarullah fighters. Tajik authorities reportedly wanted the Jamaat Ansarullah militants extradited to Tajikistan. The Taliban instead offered to act as a mediator in negotiations between the two groups. Jamaat Ansarullah’s leadership said they would only talk if the Tajik government met several unreasonable—for Tajik authorities—conditions including declaring Tajikistan an Islamic state and removing Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan. However, contact between Tajik and the Taliban had been established. As recently as August 2024, Saimumin Yatimov, the leader of Tajikistan’s security service, visited Kabul to reportedly discuss strengthening ties between Tajikistan and the Taliban. Aside from militants, Tajikistan risks being left out of trade routes through Afghanistan that are being planned or already slowly opening. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have all been working with Taliban officials to improve connectivity between Central Asia and Afghanistan and hopefully extend proposed trade routes to Iran and the Arabian Sea. Among these projects are the Trans-Afghan railway connecting Uzbekistan (and through Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries) to Pakistan, a railway from Kazakhstan through Turkmenistan and on to Herat, Afghanistan with spurs to Iran or continuing through Afghanistan to Kandahar and Spin Boldak on the Pakistani border. Another proposed railway is the 250-mile Tajikistan–Afghanistan–Turkmenistan (TAT) line. That project dates back more than a decade. However, in August 2024, Tajikistan’s Transport Ministry signed a protocol with the Korea International Cooperation Agency for a feasibility study for the 30-mile Tajik section of the railway. Tajik Transport Minister Azim Ibrohim said the line would connect Tajikistan to markets in South Asia, and acting South Korean Ambassador to Tajikistan Jeon Sung-sik said the railway would 'enable Tajikistan to access maritime routes and become a crucial link in international transportation.' China has shown interest in this route also as part of a multimodal trade route that passes through eastern Tajikistan to the Chinese border by road. Tajikistan has continued to export electricity to Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power. The power transmission lines were built during the years foreign troops were in Afghanistan and in the months after the Taliban seized control, Tajikistan’s electricity shipments to Afghanistan were one of the only links preserved with Tajikistan’s southern neighbor. The Taliban said early on that they would pay for the electricity, and they have kept their word. In February 2024, the World Bank announced construction of the Central Asia–South Asia (CASA-1000) power line had resumed. CASA-1000 aims to use hydropower plants in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to bring one thousand megawatts (MW) of electricity to Pakistan and 300 MW to Afghanistan. The Trade-Off Afghanistan has been a constant source of concern since Tajikistan became independent in 1991. For Tajikistan, an amicable understanding with the Taliban represents an unprecedented sense of security plus economic and trade opportunities. There are complications, however. Rahmon has repeatedly called the Taliban a threat to the security of Tajikistan and Central Asia more broadly for 30 years. Rahmon has mentioned the plight of ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power and called for an inclusive government. Those remarks have earned Rahmon some rare widespread public support in Tajikistan. How would Rahmon explain to his people that the Taliban can be a partner to Tajikistan? Underscoring the sensitivity of this problem, Rahmon banned the IRPT saying they were a terrorist group. Before being banned, the IRPT was the second largest political party in Tajikistan, behind Rahmon’s People’s Democratic Party of Tajikistan. The 1997 Tajik Peace Accord appointed IRPT representatives to government positions. Until 2015, the IRPT had deputies in the lower house of the Tajik parliament. The IRPT is far more moderate than the ultra-Orthodox Taliban whose brutal rule of the late 1990s has carried over into the current regime. So how can the IRPT be such a threat? And how can the Taliban be a party with which Tajik authorities can associate? More importantly, the Tajik government has profited greatly from being a neighbor to unstable and menacing Afghanistan. Tajikistan has always been donor dependent and has received generous help largely because it has been a frontline against Islamic radicalism coming out of Afghanistan. Social programs, education, water purification, energy projects, and more have been funded by international organizations and individual countries. Part of the reason for this aid was to improve the socioeconomic situation in Tajikistan and strengthen the resolve of the country’s people against the lure of groups such as the Taliban or ISK. Security cooperation is probably the key benefit Tajikistan has received. On September 1, 2021, the US Embassy in Tajikistan posted on its website that a US-funded project had just launched to build new facilities for a Tajik border guard unit stationed along the Afghan frontier. The statement said some of the new additions 'will allow the Border Patrol to quickly deploy forces to border areas in response to threats.' The statement noted that, since 2002, the US government spent more than $300 million to repair or reconstruct 12 border posts, nine border crossings, and three training centers for border guards. The US has also provided nonlethal aid to Tajikistan’s border guards including border surveillance, night-vision equipment, jeeps, quadbikes, and sniffer dogs. The European Union as a body and individual countries within the EU, NATO, Russia, China, and other parties have also provided military equipment and uniforms and built facilities for border forces. Conclusion If the Tajik government and Taliban can reach a durable truce and establish some form of cooperation, the threat level for Tajikistan diminishes. The concerns of foreign governments and organizations for Tajikistan’s security also subside. Peace with the Taliban could significantly reduce the amount of foreign financial and security assistance Tajikistan has become accustomed to seeing. In an odd contradiction, instability in Afghanistan has been good for Rahmon’s government. However, harsh stability in Afghanistan imposed by the Taliban could halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that has been propping up the Tajik government for three decades.

G20 Economies Should Target Reforms To Boost Medium-Term Growth P...	For most Group of Twenty economies, growth is poised to weaken over the next five years and remain well below what was typical in the two decades before the pandemic. That’s one of the biggest shared challenges for the group, which accounts for about 85 percent of global gross domestic product. Growth is more robust across the African Union, which joined the G20 last year, but booming populations mean those economies also must create jobs for millions of young people entering the labor market. For both groups, as well as the European Union, lifting growth is essential to improving outcomes for people, and there's a common solution: implementing priority reforms can significantly boost prospects for growth over the next five years, or medium term, as our new report to the G20 outlines. Our analysis also indicates that payoffs from structural reforms are greatest when they are carefully sequenced and reflect social consensus. Various challenges underscore why it’s time to invest in growth-enhancing reforms. Subdued productivity growth, reinforced in some countries by adverse demographic trends, holds back potential growth, as Chapter 3 of the April 2024 World Economic Outlook details. Sustainable growth also is imperiled by elevated public debt, and increased geoeconomic fragmentation and protectionism. As the Chart of the Week shows, the biggest priority across countries in these groups is reforming fiscal policy frameworks to aid lasting consolidation of government budgets. Specifically, most G20 advanced economies and several EU economies would benefit from tighter public spending limits, while for most G20 emerging market and developing economies reforms to boost government revenues should be prioritized. Several African Union countries could benefit from enhanced fiscal transparency. For many G20 and African Union economies, there are two other key areas for high priority structural reforms. First, the quality of education and skill training must be improved to better match skills with job opportunities. Second, reforms to accelerate the energy transition are essential, such as improving renewable energy capacity, enhancing the carbon tax efficacy, and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. In several African Union economies, governance reforms are also urgently needed to strengthen the rule of law, fight corruption and improve public finance management.

Manila Takes A Bold Stance On The South China Sea – Analysis	By Edcel John A Ibarra The Philippines’ new ‘unyielding’ foreign policy on the South China Sea seems to be unsettling ASEAN. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has launched a transparency initiative that exposes China’s illegal aggression in the South China Sea. The Philippines has also strengthened its defence cooperation with the United States and allied countries and has begun exploring military agreements with new partners. Altogether, these moves are viewed as undermining ASEAN neutrality and non-alignment. While similar criticisms may be levelled against other ASEAN members, ASEAN remains neutral and non-aligned despite the Philippines’ policy shift. ASEAN is known for not choosing sides among the great powers, but this is not because each member adheres strictly to neutrality and non-alignment. Some members are known to have chosen sides because of geographic, historical or economic factors. These diverse national-level stances contribute to ASEAN’s overarching neutrality and non-alignment. If ASEAN imposed neutrality and non-alignment to all members, it would contravene its core norm of non-interference and cause internal disagreements. Given that no ASEAN member has been strictly neutral and non-aligned, the terms are also nebulous. On the South China Sea issue, ASEAN countries are binding themselves to strict interpretations. Legal and historical definitions of neutrality and non-alignment do not prevent ASEAN from speaking out against China’s maritime assertiveness. Under the Law of Neutrality, states do not lose their neutral status when they verbally condemn a belligerent state, as long as they do not materially assist the other side. Similarly, under the Bandung Principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, states are justified in calling out aggression against their territorial integrity. Neutrality and non-alignment are compatible with taking a principled stance, but ASEAN still often settles for watered-down language or silence. Since ASEAN is known to be pragmatic rather than principled, the Philippines is fulfilling a function that no other member would dare—enforcing the norm of a rules-based maritime order. The Philippines’ transparency initiative and its public rebukes of China’s aggression work towards this goal. While these strategies are seen as increasing tensions, if the Philippines remains silent on the South China Sea, the rules-based maritime order it seeks would be endangered. Public rebukes against China help Filipinos internalise the norm, making it politically costly for future Philippine administrations to ignore it. Rebukes also help during norm cascades. Ridicule and constant reminders of a norm’s parameters should make deviations less likely in the long term, if not by China, then at least by other states. If this function were left to the United States or a Western power, rivalry with China would intensify, making it important that rebukes come from the region. The Philippines’ decision to re-embrace the United States must be understood against the backdrop of China’s maritime assertiveness and ASEAN’s unwillingness to stand up against it. A different policy might have emerged from Manila if China had tempered its aggression and ASEAN offered stronger support. Early in his presidency, Marcos sought to continue his predecessor’s friendliness toward China. But China’s aggression has made this policy untenable. Without a long-overdue ASEAN–China code of conduct in the South China Sea, future Philippine presidents will find themselves defending the Philippines’ maritime rights as affirmed by the arbitration award. Though often forgetten now, the Philippines’ policy U-turn began during the last two years of president Rodrigo Duterte’s leadership. Duterte had to deal with increasing incidents with China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, culminating in the retraction of the cancellation of a key military agreement with Washington, keeping the alliance alive. The Philippines’ re-embrace of the United States is not external interference. In the South China Sea, the United States is not an external party. While it is not a claimant of territorial or maritime space, it is a claimaint of maritime rights. Insofar as China’s actions threaten these universal maritime rights, Washington and the rest of the world are dispuntants in the South China Sea. Policymakers in Manila believe that some form of military balance is needed but because the country’s armed forces are weak and ASEAN will not commit to a common defence posture, the remaining option is to make the most of the Philippines’ longstanding alliance with the United States. Some fear that this risks turning the South China Sea into a militarised zone—but even without the United States, it already is. The Philippines is not relying solely on the United States. It has been courting new strategic partners since 2010, a policy which Marcos has continued. The Philippines has three other strategic partners—Japan, Vietnam and Australia. Like other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines is hedging, but only with states that share its principles. If ASEAN feels unsettled by the Philippines’ recent actions, it has itself to blame. As the region navigates the US–China rivalry, the diversity of responses emerging from within ASEAN will prove beneficial. Rather than equating this diversity with disunity, it may be better interpreted through the logic of pluralism—instead of seeking unity for unity’s sake, each country should be free to contribute to order-building in ASEAN as they see fit.

Who Is Calin Georgescu, The Far-Right Winner Of Romania’s Preside...	By Tony Wesolowsky and RFE/RL's Romanian Service (RFE/RL) -- Experts had tipped a far-right candidate as one of the favorites in Romania's presidential election, predicting a runoff with an established politician in a poll monitored closely as a barometer of populism in Europe and eroding public support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. The experts were right and wrong. Yes, a far-right candidate will go to Romania's presidential runoff on December 8. But it wasn't the one they and polls were predicting. Calin Georgescu, an independent who barely registered in pre-election polling, not only did better than expected: The 62-year-old agricultural engineer won the November 24 first round with about 22 percent of the vote. The race for second place turned into a drama of its own. The leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) was in a tight race with Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union, a pro-Western liberal. With 99.9 percent of the vote counted, it was Lasconi, an ardent backer of Romania's membership in NATO and the EU as well as a vocal supporter of Ukraine, who emerged as the second-place finisher. Disappointment With Liberal Incumbent Thirteen candidates ran for the presidency in the European Union and NATO member country. The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy, and judicial appointments. Romania will also hold parliamentary elections on December 1 that will determine the country's next government and prime minister. The outgoing center-right incumbent, Klaus Iohannis, ends his second term after a decade in office. For many voters, he and his ruling National Liberal Party have been a disappointment, with Iohannis widely criticized for his figurative absence during crucial events such as the coronavirus pandemic. Voter concerns included corruption, inflation, and the state of the health and education sectors. Another issue was the conflict in neighboring Ukraine and how that conflict could change with a switch in Washington from U.S. President Joe Biden, who has steadily backed Kyiv, to President-elect Donald Trump, who has suggested support could be curtailed. Romania has become a key ally of Ukraine, not only providing training and military equipment, including a Patriot missile defense system, but playing a key role in transporting Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods to global markets. Much of the credit for Bucharest's pro-Ukraine stance goes to the incumbent, Iohannis. Surprise Win But it was Georgescu's surprise showing that grabbed headlines. Ahead of the vote, experts were focused on a different far-right figure. Opinion polls showed that George Simion, leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), was in second or even first place. Analysts had expected Simion, a vocal supporter of Trump, to face Ciolacu in the second round. Simion has campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from neighboring Ukraine. Georgescu was also a prominent member of AUR, which had picked him as their choice for prime minister. But he left the party in 2022 amid criticism from senior AUR leaders that his pro-Russian, anti-NATO stance was detrimental to the party's image. In a 2021 interview, he called NATO's ballistic missile defense shield in Deveselu, southern Romania, a 'shame of diplomacy,' claiming the military alliance would not defend any of its members in case of a Russian attack. He has also said Ion Antonescu, Romania's de facto World War II leader who was sentenced to death for his part in Romania's Holocaust, and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the pre-World War II leader of the Iron Guard -- one of Europe's most violent anti-Semitic movements -- were national heroes. Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania's Environment Ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program. TikTok Campaign Like other fringe politicians, Georgescu is savvy with social media. His TikTok account had 1.6 million likes. On it, he has posted videos of himself attending church, doing judo, running on a track, and speaking on podcasts. Just days before the vote, Georgescu launched a TikTok campaign calling for an end to aid for Ukraine, apparently striking a chord with voters. He has also sounded a skeptical note on Romania's NATO membership. His anti-Western messaging is routinely amplified on Russian, state-run media and Kremlin-friendly social media. After casting his ballot, Georgescu said in a post on Facebook that he voted 'for the unjust, for the humiliated, for those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.... The vote is a prayer for the nation.' His other stances include supporting Romanian farmers, reducing dependency on imports, and ramping up energy and food production. Simion said he congratulated Georgescu and that he was 'very happy that approximately 40 percent of the votes of Romanians went toward the sovereign option' and that he would be in the second round. The runoff vote on December 8 will offer a stark choice between Georgescu and Lasconi, who among the leading candidates was the most bullish on Romania's membership in the EU and NATO, even calling for a greater NATO presence in Romania. Lasconi was also the only leading candidate to reject Ukraine making territorial concessions to secure peace.

Could An Increase In The Supply Of Gold Cause A Boom-Bust Cycle? ...	By Frank Shostak According to the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT), the artificial increase in the money supply via central bank expansionary monetary policy lowers the market interest rate. This, in turn, causes the market interest rate to deviate from the natural rate, determined by the market. Consequently, this leads to the boom-bust cycle. Understanding this, on the gold standard, where money is gold and—assuming that there is no central bank—an increase in the supply of gold will also result in the lowering of the market interest rates. This would cause a deviation of the market interest rates from the previous interest rate. Consequently, this is going to set in motion a boom-bust cycle. This means that even on the gold standard, without the central bank, we could still have boom-bust cycles. According to Murphy, 'The unsustainable boom occurs when a newly created (or mined) quantity of money enters the loan market and distorts interest rates, before other prices in the economy have had time to adjust. In principle, this process could occur even in the case of commodity money with 100 percent reserve banking.' Note again, according to Murphy, the increase in the supply of gold also could set the boom-bust cycle in motion, though Mises believed, in practice, this theoretical possibility would have a negligible effect. Murray Rothbard disagreed with this. He held that increases in the supply of gold could not set in motion the boom-bust cycle. For him, the key reason behind the boom-bust cycle is the act of embezzlement brought about by the expansionary monetary policy of the central bank, which sets in motion an increase in the money supply out of 'thin air.' According to Rothbard, 'Inflation, in this work, is explicitly defined to exclude increases in the stock of specie. While these increases have such similar effects as raising the prices of goods, they also differ sharply in other effects: (a) simple increases in specie do not constitute an intervention in the free market, penalizing one group and subsidizing another; and (b) they do not lead to the processes of the business cycle.' Following this reasoning, what uniquely sets the boom-bust cycle into motion is the artificial, inflationary increase in the money supply. The increase in this type of money sets an exchange of nothing for something (i.e., the diversion of wealth from wealth-generators to non-wealth-generators and their projects). The expansionary policy of the central bank impoverishes wealth producers and enriches first possessors of the newly-created money and credit. For Rothbard, then, the boom-bust cycle emerges because of the expansionary policies of the central bank, which set in motion the act of embezzlement. A major contributor to the inflationary process is commercial bank credit expansion. This type of credit is facilitated by the expansionary monetary policy of the central bank. This expansionary monetary policy produces false economic prosperity—the economic boom. When the limited savings come under pressure because of the false economic boom, banks start to accumulate non-performing assets. Consequently, they necessarily slow the expansion of artificial credit. As a rule—pressured by increasing price inflation—central bank’s also respond by tightening monetary policy. The unsound investments and ventures, dependent on loose artificial monetary policy, cannot survive the monetary contraction. An economic bust results. It is the act of fraud which sets the boom-bust cycle into motion via inflationary additions to the money supply. This artificial expansion of money and credit is also responsible for price inflation. Gold and the Boom-Bust Cycle? The reason why miners mine gold is because there is a market for it. Gold contributes to the subjective well-being of individuals. In this sense, it is part of the pool of wealth. Now over time, individuals have discovered that gold—being originally useful in making jewelry—has a great appeal as the medium of the exchange. As a result, they may begin to assign a much greater exchange-value to gold than before. Hence, the increase in the supply of gold amounts to the increase in wealth, distinct from the inherently artificial nature of inflation. When a producer of gold exchanges it for goods, he is engaging in the exchange of something for something. He is exchanging wealth for wealth. New gold in a system requires production and/or exchange. Phony Warehouse Receipts, Fiat Money, or Fiduciary Media Cause Boom-Bust Cycles Contrast this with the unbacked by gold 'receipts' that are used as the medium of the exchange. These receipts were issued without the corresponding gold deposited for safekeeping. These receipts generate the same outcome as the counterfeit money does, yet on a much larger scale. This sets the stage for increased consumption without contributing to production or savings. Unbacked fiat certificates set in motion an exchange of nothing for something which, in turn, distorts the price-structure and the structure of production and leads to boom-bust cycles. This also sets the stage for widespread embezzlement once these certificates are employed in an exchange for goods and services. Through the signals from the increased purchasing and investments, this creates an artificial economic boom. Once this process slows down or stops altogether, it halts the diversion of wealth to various activities that emerged because of inflation. As a result, these activities come under pressure and an economic bust results. Without the inflation of money and credit, which divert wealth to them, these economic activities are in trouble. Without easy money, they cannot survive or continue at the same current rate. By contrast, in the case of an increase in the supply of gold, no fraud is committed here. The supplier of gold—the gold mine—has increased the production of a demanded commodity. Therefore, in this case there is not an exchange of nothing for something. The gold producer, by producing something demanded in the market, can exchange it for other goods. He does not create empty money to fraudulently divert wealth to himself. We can thus conclude that the gold standard, if not abused, is not conducive of boom-bust cycles. The gold standard has nothing to do with embezzlement. That said, the inflationary increase in the money supply and the increase in the supply of gold are going to generate a change in price relations and possibly the market interest rate. This addition of gold does not set the boom-bust cycle. A boom-bust cycle, by its nature, is generated by artificial additions to the money supply. If the interest rate change is due to an increase in the supply of gold, which is an increase in wealth, no boom-bust cycle is going to emerge. Cantillon effects, however, will result. An increase in the supply of gold can cause the prices and the market interest rate to change and this is likely to cause fluctuations in economic activity. However, boom-bust cycles are not about free market fluctuations, they are about inflationary monetary policy. Boom-bust cycles are generated by an act of embezzlement. Such cycles are about the diversion of wealth from true wealth-generators to the holders of the new-created and artificial money. In a free market economy, there are continuous changes and there is no stability as such, but that does not equate to the disruptions caused by monetary interventionism. Conclusion The key for the emergence of the boom-bust cycles are inflationary increases in the money supply. These increases set in motion an exchange of nothing for something (i.e., changes in price relations, the diversion of wealth, and distortions in the capital structure). The increase in the supply of gold is not the same. The increase in the supply of gold is an increase in the supply of wealth and production. This increase does not lead to the exchange of nothing for something. Contrary to non-wealth-generating and unsound activities, true wealth-generating activities can support themselves without inflationary expansion of money and credit to divert wealth to themselves. Artificial increases in the money supply, not increases in the gold supply, bring about the menace of the boom-bust cycle.

Trump Card Or Sisyphean Mission? – OpEd	As President Trump finalises his dream team to make the United States (US) great again, the most intriguing appointment is of Elon Musk and Vivek former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Despite its name, the department is not a government agency though it has been suggested that its main aim is to help business tycoons such as Musk dodge government regulations by leveraging their wealth to influence policy making. It is an advisory commission that, according to Trump, will ' work from outside government to offer the White House 'advice and guidance' and partner with the Office of Management and Budget to 'drive large-scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before'. DOGE Role Model for the World? DOGE is an undertaking which many countries in the world should be looking at closely not only for its impact in the US but also as a possible role model for their own governments. This applies to western allies of the US where disillusionment and distrust of government has become pronounced as evidenced by recent polls. It is also found in countries in the developing world where the rapid and unchecked growth of their bureaucracies - increasingly bloated, outdated, unaccountable and corrupt - has hindered rather than contributed to their socio-economic progress. Trump explained that the surprise move was to shock government systems and to 'pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies'. According to Musk, if DOGE succeeds, it can trim up to US$2 trillion from the current US federal budget of US$6.4 trillion whilst Ramaswamy has touted that it could reduce the number of federal employees by as much as 75%. Trump has also been vocal that it is to address 'massive waste and fraud' in government spending. Less prominent in pronouncements on DOGE is that it is to drain the swamp and to battle the deep state that Trump and supporters see as the main reason for his inability to implement the policy reforms of his first term. 'Either the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state,' the president-elect told supporters at his first rally of the 2024 election cycle. This is easier said than done. Not only have previous attempts at trimming back the federal bureaucracy failed - the most recent during Reagan’s presidency - it can be expected that key forces within Congress, the federal bureaucracy and deep state actors - will fight to kill off attempts at downsizing the bureaucracy as this threatens their influence and power. Why DOGE Will Fail The campaign to disparage and stymie DOGE has already begun in earnest with US mainstream media giants such as CNN and New York Times fully engaged in bad mouthing the proposed agency even before it has begun work. The most favoured line of attack for now is that the new agency is an attempt at revenge and retribution by Trump. Mainstream media voices are being joined by those from the American left concerned that DOGE may be a tool for big business. A recent report in Jacobin, a leading socialist print and social media outlet described DOGE as 'asinine and dystopian' and expressed the hope that its relationship with the Trump administration 'flames out spectacularly' ( There may be a number of other possible outcomes, apart from flaming out, arising from this unprecedented attempt at institutional reform The one with the highest possibility is that it will fade out - not spectacularly but probably with a whimper. Conceived as a advisory task force - a high powered think tank at best according to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the centre-right American Action Forum - it has no evidence of bipartisan support or budget to get its plans going, DOGE is dependent on the persuasive power of Musk and Ramaswamy. Both are entrepreneurs without political experience to bring to the congressional jungle where their business prowess will not count for much. Meanwhile, their promoter, Trump, will have bigger battles on his hands so this particular 'shock and awe' approach is likely to prove short-lived. A second is that while DOGE may bring about some closure of governmental agencies, the process of downsizing through encouraging early retirement and voluntary departure is much more difficult than in the private sector. There will be a thicket of legal and political challenges to overcome from progressive and conservative quarters that have constituents who are a part or supportive of the federal bureaucracy elite ensconced in Washington D.C. As for draining the swamp and fighting the deep state, these too appear a losing battle. More likely is that even if the current Democrat swamp is drained, it will be a partial drainage and will be refilled with supporters from Trump's own swamp looking out for their own rather than America’s interests and well being. The deep state with its support groups embedded in the FBI, CIA, Defence and Justice departments and the military industrial complex will be the hardest obstacle for DOGE to overcome. The warning shots have already been fired at Trump. Expect these to continue with Musk and Ramaswamy as the latest targets.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGMbX8_h92VyV	2024-11-25T16:10:21-08:00	
What The FDA Gets Wrong About Drug Ads – OpEd	There are only two countries in the world where drug manufacturers are allowed to advertise their products directly to consumers: the United States and New Zealand. Drug companies in the United States, for example, are spending $4 billion a year on TV ads alone. The typical TV drug ad these days usually touts the benefits of a drug—maybe with a lot of singing and dancing—and closes with a brief rapid-fire list of possible side effects, as parodied on Saturday Night Live. That’s about to change. After 15 years of studying the matter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is going to require the ads to show less about the benefits and more about the side effects and risks. A new bill in Congress would impose similar restrictions on social media platforms. Under a Trump administration, regulations could become even harsher. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (Donald Trump’s pick to head Health and Human Services) wants to ban drug ads completely. Kennedy claims that drug ads are such an important source of revenue for the networks that they influence what is allowed on the regular programming (e.g., avoiding criticism of Pharma). Here is what the regulators and would-be regulators are missing. Our most important health care problem is not that people are taking too many prescription drugs. They are taking too few. Why Drug Advertising Is Good The social value of drug advertising is that it alerts patients to the fact that there is a possible remedy for a chronic illness. The payoff is that the viewer might seek medical advice from a doctor and get a prescription, where appropriate. There is no social value in ads that list risks and negative side effects. The information will always be too clipped to be understandable, it won’t be remembered anyway, and it is useless unless a doctor finds that the patient is a candidate for the drug. The time to discuss side effects is when patients are under a doctor’s care. Studies show that we get our best return in medicine on drugs. Per dollar spent, the return on investing in drug therapy is much higher than what we are getting from investing in doctor care or hospital therapies. For example, Columbia University’s Frank Lichtenberg has estimated that three quarters of the increase in life expectancy that we’ve enjoyed in recent decades is the sole result of our adoption of modern drugs. Yet we are underinvesting in drugs, as reflected in undertreatment rates for chronic illness in this country. Take diabetes. Studies show that only 2.4% of people with prediabetes receive a prescription for metformin (the preferred treatment) within a year of their diagnosis. Even among obese patients, the figure is only 10.4%. Three years after an initial diagnosis, when the patient is even more susceptible to the disease, the treatment rate is still surprisingly low: 3.9% overall and only 14% for obese patients. Or consider hypertension. One out of every four patients with the problem is not being treated at all. And only half of adults with hypertension have their blood pressure under control. Almost as bad as not getting the prescription people need is not taking the drug once it is in hand. Both problems arise for similar reasons. Nearly half of all Americans suffer from at least one ongoing or chronic health condition, and nearly half of these are not adhering to a needed drug regime. There are an estimated 125,000 deaths per year in the United States due to medication nonadherence. Further, an estimated 33% to 69% of medication-related hospital admissions are due to poor adherence. The total cost estimates for medication nonadherence range from $100 billion to $300 billion every year, when both direct and indirect costs are included. Nonadherence and failure to get a prescription in the first place occur for a variety of reasons: lack of information, misinformation and unfounded fear—all of which can be combatted with more, not less, information. Current Rules Restrict Use of Valuable Drugs Not only are the new rules ill-advised, the ones in force right now are already causing considerable harm. That’s because a drug prescribed by doctors—no matter how useful and widespread the application—cannot be advertised, even to doctors themselves, unless the use has been FDA- approved. Once a drug has been approved for one use by the FDA, doctors may find that it has other uses—even though the effectiveness of these other uses has never been studied through an FDA-approved trial. These are called 'off label' uses. For example, one study found that approximately 80% of oncologists had prescribed medications off-label in treating cancer patients. Another study found that about half of chemotherapy drugs are administered for conditions not specified on their FDA-approved labels. For pediatric care, physicians order at least one off-label drug in 18.5% of office visits. The practice is most common in neonate cancer patients, with 83% of visits involving an off-label prescription. For the population as a whole, about 10% to 20% of all prescriptions are for off-label uses. It is hard to exaggerate how unreasonable FDA regulations are in this regard. Even if researchers publish research findings on the off-label use of a drug in the New England Journal of Medicine, a drug company is not allowed to share that article with doctors. If they do, the drug company’s decision makers could wind up in prison! When it comes to the potential of drugs to treat chronic conditions, more information is better than less. And this is especially true in an age when there is so much misinformation on the internet. We should let people learn about the positive benefits of drugs from TV ads and other venues. That will encourage them to seek a doctor’s counsel. The doctor’s office is the place where risks and side effects should be discussed.

Mozambique: Security Force Crackdown Kills, Injures Children, Say...	Mozambican security forces deployed to suppress nationwide post-election protests have killed at least 10 children and injured dozens more since October 24, 2024, Human Rights Watch said. Police have detained hundreds of children, in many cases for days, without notifying their families, in violation of international human rights law. The protests and ensuing government crackdown have led to severe disruptions of education throughout the country. 'The Mozambican security forces that have used force unlawfully against protesters and bystanders have also showed a shocking disregard for the lives of children,' said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. 'The authorities should immediately release all those held, including children, for exercising their rights to free expression and assembly.' Post-election tensions escalated on October 24 after supporters of the independent presidential candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, and the leading opposition party, Optimistic People for the Development of Mozambique (Partido Optimista pelo Desenvolvimento de Moçambique, Podemos), rejected the official declaration that the ruling party and its candidates were the winners of the October 9 election. Mondlane had claimed victory the day after the polls closed. The ensuing protests called for by the opposition began largely peacefully. However, government security forces used live ammunition, rubber bullets, and tear gas to disperse the crowds. Protesters responded by burning tires, blocking roads, and throwing rocks and other objects at the police. On October 29, Mondlane called for a weeklong nationwide shutdown, culminating in a major march in Maputo, the capital, on November 7. In response, Interior Minister Pascoal Ronda accused Mondlane of causing terror and urged people not to join the protests because it could 'end up degenerating into acts of vandalism and violence.' The deputy police chief, Fernando Tsucana, during a live television interview with the privately operated station STV on November 3, pledged to ensure security on the streets and urged parents to send their children back to school. Many schools had been closed because of the violence. A spokesman for the Education Ministry, Manuel Simbini, told Human Rights Watch that the government had instructed schools to make alternative provisions for almost 13,000 students who were unable to take their final exams across the country due to the violence. A 26-year-old woman said that her sister was among those parents who believed the authorities’ pledge of safety and sent her 13-year-old daughter to school on November 4, despite the reported violence in their neighborhood. 'The situation was already tense with many police officers around,' she said. 'But my niece had to go to school because the teacher had scheduled a written test for that day.' On her way back from school just before 11 a.m., the girl was caught in a crowd of people fleeing tear gas and gunfire by the security forces. One of the bullets hit her in the neck, and she instantly fell to the ground and died, two witnesses said. Human Rights Watch documented nine additional cases of children killed and at least 36 other children injured by gunfire during the protests. The mother of a 6-year-old boy in Maputo’s Chamanculo neighborhood said that on November 5 they were standing in line to buy bread around 10 a.m., when nine riot police officers arrived in a pickup truck. Without warning they fired teargas and live bullets to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside the bakery. She said: 'We tried to run away, but there was no place to go or hide, so a bullet hit my son in the stomach.' She added that police officers took him and other injured people to the nearby Chamanculo hospital for medical treatment. The media reported further violations of children’s rights by the security forces and some protesters, including vandalizing schools, burning classrooms, and endangering children’s lives. Footage shared on social media on November 4, which Human Rights Watch geolocated to have been recently recorded outside a school in Tete province, appears to show dozens of children in school uniform fleeing in panic, after security forces allegedly threw tear gas canisters into their school premises. Human Rights Watch also documented the arbitrary detention for several days of children whom the security forces allegedly arrested during protests without notifying their families. The Mozambican Bar Association reported on November 6 that it had secured the release of over 2,700 people detained throughout the country for participation in the post-election demonstrations. Feroza Zacarias, head of the bar association’s human rights section, said that a significant number of the detainees were children and adolescents. A 17-year-old girl was arrested on November 17 during a 'pots and pans' protestin the capital’s Jardim neighborhood. Her father said the family only learned about her whereabouts two days later from the bar association. He said that when police officers at the station demanded payment of 25,000 meticals (around US$392) for his daughter’s release, he refused to pay on a lawyer’s advice. His daughter was released on November 21, without charges, after the bar association intervened. Mozambican authorities have publicly criticized the involvement of children in the protests. The National Council of Defense said in a statement that it 'deplore[d] in the strongest terms the involvement of children and the veiled attempt to subvert the legitimately established democratic order.' The statement did not mention children’s right to protest and the need for accountability for abuses against children. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child both affirm children’s rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly. Under the convention, children found in conflict with the law should be detained 'only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.' 'Concerned governments should press Mozambican authorities to stop unnecessary and excessive use of force against child protesters and bystanders and urgently address the harm to children’s education,' Ngari said. 'Those found responsible should be held accountable.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGCsAGWefyARB	2024-11-25T15:57:44-08:00	
Divide And Conquer: Political Riptides Threaten To Overwhelm The ...	Once again we find ourselves approaching that time of year when, as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln proclaimed, we’re supposed to give thanks as a nation and as individuals for our safety and our freedoms. But how do you give thanks for freedoms that are constantly being eroded? How do you express gratitude for one’s safety when the perils posed by the American police state grow more treacherous by the day? How do you come together as a nation in thanksgiving when the powers-that-be continue to polarize and divide us into warring factions? You can see this struggle—to reconcile the hope for a better, freer, more just world with the soul-sucking reality of a world in which greed, meanness and war continue to triumph—in John Lennon’s two songs, 'Imagine' (which exhorted us to 'Imagine all the people livin’ life in peace') and 'Happy Xmas (War Is Over)' (which was part of a major anti-war campaign, which were released within months of each other in 1971. Lennon—a musical genius, anti-war activist, and a high-profile example of the lengths to which the Deep State will go to persecute those who dare to challenge its authority—made clear that the only way to achieve an end to hunger, violence, war, and tyranny is to want it badly enough and work towards it. All these years later, we still don’t seem to want those things badly enough. Peace remains out of reach. Activists and whistleblowers continue to be prosecuted for challenging the government’s authority. Militarism is on the rise, all the while the governmental war machine continues to wreak havoc on innocent lives. For those of us who joined with Lennon to imagine a world of peace, it’s getting harder to reconcile that dream with the reality of the American police state. Those who do dare to speak up about government corruption are labeled dissidents, troublemakers, terrorists, lunatics, or mentally ill and tagged for surveillance, censorship or involuntary detention. And then there are those who remain silent while the world falls apart. By doing nothing, the onlookers become as guilty as the perpetrator. It works the same whether you’re talking about kids watching bullies torment a fellow student on a playground, passersby watching someone dying on a sidewalk, or citizens remaining silent in the face of government atrocities. There’s a term for this phenomenon where people stand by, watch and do nothing—even when there is no risk to their safety—while some horrific act takes place: it’s called the bystander effect. Historically, this bystander syndrome in which people remain silent and disengaged—mere onlookers—in the face of abject horrors and injustice has resulted in whole populations being conditioned to tolerate unspoken cruelty toward their fellow human beings: the crucifixion and slaughter of innocents by the Romans, the torture of the Inquisition, the atrocities of the Nazis, the butchery of the Fascists, the bloodshed by the Communists, and the cold-blooded war machines run by the military industrial complex. Psychological researchers John Darley and Bibb Latane mounted a series of experiments to discover why people respond with apathy or indifference instead of intervening. According to Darley and Latane, there are two critical factors that contribute to this moral lassitude. First, there’s the problem of pluralistic ignorance in which individuals in a group look to others to determine how to respond. Second, there’s the problem of 'diffusion of responsibility,' which is compounded by pluralistic ignorance. Basically, this means that no one acts to intervene or help because each person is waiting for someone else to do so. Their findings underscore the fact that evil prevails when good people do nothing. We see it all the time: when people are vocal about politics but silent in the face of human suffering and injustice, tyranny triumphs. For instance, psychologist Philip Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment studied the impact of perceived power and authority on middleclass students who were assigned to act as prisoners and prison guards. The experiment revealed that power does indeed corrupt (the appointed guards became increasingly abusive), and those who were relegated to being prisoners acted increasingly 'submissive and depersonalized, taking the abuse and saying little in protest.' This is how imperial presidents preside over police states. So, what can we do? Be modern-day Good Samaritans and do your part to push back against the darkness. Recognize injustice. Don’t turn away from suffering. Refuse to remain silent. Take a stand. Speak up. Speak out. 'If you think there is even a possibility that someone needs help, act on it,' advises Zimbardo. 'You may save a life. You are the modern version of the Good Samaritan that makes the world a better place for all of us.' This is what Zimbardo refers to as 'the power of one.' All it takes is one person breaking away from the fold to change the dynamics of a situation. Here’s what I suggest: this holiday season, do yourselves a favor and turn off the talking heads, shut down the screen devices, tune out the politicians, take a deep breath, then do something to pay your blessings forward. Find something to be thankful for about the things and people in your community for which you might have the least tolerance or appreciation. Instead of just rattling off a list of things you’re thankful for that sound good, dig a little deeper and acknowledge the good in those you may have underappreciated or feared. When it comes time to giving thanks for your good fortune, put your gratitude into action: pay your blessings forward with deeds that spread a little kindness, lighten someone’s burden, and brighten some dark corner. Engage in acts of kindness. Smile more. Fight less. Build bridges. Refuse to let toxic politics define your relationships. Focus on the things that unite instead of that which divides. Do your part to push back against the meanness of our culture with conscious compassion and humanity. Moods are contagious, the good and the bad. They can be passed from person to person. So can the actions associated with those moods, the good and the bad. Acts of benevolence, no matter how inconsequential they might seem, can spark a movement. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, all it takes is one person to start a chain reaction. For instance, a few years ago in Florida, a family of six—four adults and two young boys—were swept out to sea by a powerful rip current in Panama City Beach. There was no lifeguard on duty. The police were standing by, waiting for a rescue boat. And the few people who had tried to help ended up stranded, as well. Those on shore grouped together and formed a human chain. What started with five volunteers grew to 15, then 80 people, some of whom couldn’t swim. One by one, they linked hands and stretched as far as their chain would go. The strongest of the volunteers swam out beyond the chain and began passing the stranded victims of the rip current down the chain. One by one, they rescued those in trouble and pulled each other in. There’s a moral here for what needs to happen in this country if we only can band together and prevail against the riptides that threaten to overwhelm us.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGD2wDmXW19XJ	2024-11-25T15:51:53-08:00	
The Hunter-Gatherer Guide To Keeping Society Equal – OpEd	There is a great deal of attention in modern societies to inequality and the social problems it causes. Often inequality is considered to be the unavoidable consequence of how society operates in many cultures, with large population numbers and competition for resources requiring a hierarchy of successful and less-successful individuals. While our globalized world may seem dominated by this kind of society, there remain groups around the world who even today live very differently, despite continual and sometimes inescapable pressure. Anthropologists, whose science is the study of humans, have been fascinated by the diversity of ways our species have found to exist, and never more so than when confronted with cultures whose ethos and way of being are radically different from the urban societies that dominate our world: where words are weapons that actually win; where showing off your skills will get you mocked, and where every aspect of life is carefully organized so that no one person should ever have any more power than anyone else. How do some people come to live in a group that has no one at the top, telling the rest what to do? Anthropologists call societies that do not have ranks egalitarian, which means that everyone in them is equal to everyone else. This is a form of social organization that is almost exclusively seen in groups of people who are not settled in one place, tied to one type of food or resource. Rather, they spend quite a lot of their time in small groups, moving around as suits their needs. These kinds of groups have been called hunter-gatherers, but a more accurate name might be foragers: they make their living by walking through their world and exploiting what comes to hand. More than a century of research into the groups who follow their food through the landscape, and do not tie themselves to one location or one crop, has built up a picture of societies that choose to organize themselves very differently from nation-states and kingdoms, and, most importantly, actively refuse to allow any sort of rank among themselves. For a long time, there was an assumption that egalitarian societies were egalitarian simply because they were... simple. Living in small groups and moving constantly, they just couldn't build up mountains of wealth to wield power over other people. And with very small numbers of people in a group—say no more than a few dozen—anthropologists theorized that it couldn't be that complicated to run a society, so you wouldn't need a chief or a king making big decisions. As archaeology has revealed the shape of our distant human past, it is clear that before about 15,000 years ago, every human on earth lived the same mobile lifestyle. Living with only what you can carry and constantly on the move would seem very taxing to the armchair academic of the previous century. The rather impolite implication then is that modern human societies who chose to live in these mobile, egalitarian societies, were simply the last vestiges of a primitive form of human social organization—people who hadn't 'evolved' civilization. It is actually quite remarkable that this idea that an equal society was an easy thing to maintain hung around for so long. One of the problems may have been that the groups who lived these mobile lifestyles were often in the process of being colonized and controlled when anthropologists arrived to study them, and so were in the middle of considerable social upheaval. But another problem may simply have been a failure of imagination. There was considerable shock when anthropologists like James Woodburn began to conduct fieldwork by actually learning the language of the group they were studying and going to observe and ask questions of the people themselves about how life worked in a small foraging group. His work with the Hadza people of what is now Tanzania set in motion a train of research that pointed out that life in a small group is anything but simple. Tempers flare, relationships break down, and when you depend on your group for survival, any social unrest could have fatal consequences. Groups from around the world who maintain an egalitarian ethos have shown that rather than being too simple to 'invent' rank, they are instead too complex to allow one person or group of people to simply take charge. Keeping everyone in a group on equal footing requires a huge amount of effort, and has to be constantly maintained. The Ju/'hoansi people of southern Africa reckon it is particularly important to 'cool young men's hearts'; to stop them being prideful and boastful if they display some special skill, everyone agrees it's very important to bring them back down to earth. A hunter is never allowed to distribute his own meat; instead, the distribution is done in public, with everyone watching. Among the Ju/'hoansi, the proper etiquette is to gently mock a successful hunter—for instance telling them the giraffe that they have killed and will be feeding several camps for days was actually a bit scrawny, perhaps. Mockery seems to be one of the most critical tools in the political inventory for groups that actively try to achieve equality. Jerome Lewis, an anthropologist who lived with the Mbendjele of Northern Congo for several years, tells how poor behavior is subtly (or not so subtly) corrected by women who act out whatever foolish or misguided thing someone has done. The improvisational theater always has an appreciative audience, and all of the group will laugh resoundingly at the person who has done something wrong. What might seem a recipe for social disaster in a group that must get along in order to survive is anything but; the mockery only ends when the person who is being made fun of eventually gives up and laughs along with the rest of the group. We can now see that in those groups that refuse to have ranks among themselves, there are many ways that equality can be actively maintained, but they are almost entirely social. Many groups have a policy similar to that of the Ju/'hoansi when it comes to sharing meat or indeed, anything else that is in the camp—that it would be the height of rudeness not to. Those who transgress against the rules of society may have to face their whole society laughing at them. Even when and where groups choose to move is determined partly by social concerns. If you live in a small group, it is very important to stay connected to friends and family who live somewhere else, in case, for instance, you decide you just can't stand who you are living with at the moment. It seems that the last human societies on earth to live the mobile lifestyles that our species maintained for hundreds of thousands of years do so largely as equals—but equals who must be very careful to stay that way.

A Reformist Program On Immigration (Or What Harris Might Have Sai...	The immigration issue has split and/or weakened both center and left parties and movements across many nations in recent years. Serious economic and social problems afflicting national working classes have been 'managed'—at least temporarily—by scapegoating immigrants as if they were responsible for those problems. Leaders on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating. In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be 'tough on immigrants' showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration. Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as 'protecting the nation against an immigrant 'invasion'' widely prevailed. Appeals to morality, multiculturalism, and compassion for the plight of most immigrants failed to dissuade many on the left from disengaging and moving politically rightward. The center or moderate left needs but lacks clear, strong support for immigrants that does not alienate portions of their traditional electoral base. 'Me-too' opposition to immigration, even if less harsh and hostile than that of the professional demagogues, will fail, as Kamala Harris's campaign discovered. Moreover, classic left reformism suggests a radically different program on immigration. It is derived from the reformist program (the 'Green New Deal') to address climate change when it faced a parallel problem with job-holders in polluting industries. A parallel reformist program to deal with immigration might be called an 'Inclusive New Deal.' In contrast, conservative, right-wing, and fascistic political forces have used extreme opposition to immigration to grow their ranks. Those forces boldly accuse immigrants of bringing crime, disease, downward pressure on wages, competition for jobs, and burdensome, costly demands on schools, hospitals, and other public services. Even in the United States, a country mostly composed of successive immigrant waves (who obliterated and replaced the indigenous people), many of those immigrants' descendants now hold anti-immigrant views. Despite massive evidence to the contrary, they rationalize those views by insisting that, unlike former immigrants, today's differ in being 'unwilling to work.' Rightists advance their radical 'solutions' such as sharply tightening immigration rules, refusing all further immigration, and deporting millions. Even where moral, ethical, and religious traditions call us to welcome immigrants, right-wingers have found that anti-immigration politics can work well. They attack center-leftists for seeking future votes by being pro-immigration or only weakly anti-immigration. In the United States, they attack the Democratic Party for not putting their American-born constituents first. Patriotism, as defined by such rightists, now entails a strict anti-immigrant position that displaces traditional religions' endorsement of the opposite. Immigrants forced to arrive as slaves, Black people in the United States, for example, fared differently: their integration was mostly slower and much more partial. Brown immigrants who arrived as other than slaves also suffered slower and partial integration. Anti-Black-and-Brown racism added further discrimination and life difficulties to the experience of those immigrants. Institutionalized racism denied opportunities for such immigrant communities to develop their members' levels of education, job skills, businesses, personal wealth, and social confidence. All immigrants suffer delays in their access to those qualities and capabilities, but the addition of racism worsens and lengthens those delays, including in U.S. society today. The difficulties usually endured by immigrants slow and skew the development of the economy they have entered. The occasional explosions of immigrants' resentments and bitterness at their treatment—and the usually very violent subsequent repressions—then add further damage to their host economies. Repeated efforts by those opposed to immigration have rarely succeeded in stopping it. The broad range of social forces—including the persistent effects of colonial and neo-colonial subjugation, uneven capitalist development, and climate change—that propel people to emigrate usually outweigh their concerns for their own economic, personal safety, and family interests. For employers, immigration can cheapen labor costs by expanding the supply of labor power (especially when the opposite is threatened by falling birthrates or when capital accumulation risks bidding up wages). Undocumented immigrants offer employers notoriously outrageous opportunities for super-exploitation. Hence, they often support it. An important social cost of immigration is the opportunity it has regularly presented to demagogic politicians. They have repeatedly scapegoated immigrants to deflect genuine mass discontent where it might otherwise threaten the domestic employer class. Is there unemployment? The demagogue suggests that jobs are being preferentially reserved for immigrants. Are public services inadequate? The demagogue suggests that immigrants are placing excessive demands on them and corrupt officials are directing them to immigrants to secure cheap labor or votes. Demagogues often insist—again despite evidence to the contrary—that immigrants commit more crimes and bring and spread more disease than the native-born. The campaigns of Donald Trump and many Republicans scapegoated immigrants. Many Democrats' campaigns likewise featured the scapegoating of immigrants. In contrast, the real, basic economic problems of the United States were not seriously addressed in the latest presidential election campaigns. One of those is the immense gap between haves and have-nots that has widened over the last 40 years. Another is the economic instability that has the economy oscillating between inflation and recessions. Still another is the obvious decline of the American empire (the relatively declining roles of U.S. exports, imports, investments, and the dollar) within the global economy. These issues were marginalized or, more often, ignored. Instead, candidates relentlessly scapegoated 12 million undocumented immigrants (among the poorest of the poor) as if they were the cause of and thus to blame for the deep problems of U.S. capitalism, an economy of 330 million people. Likewise, they excoriated China for the economic competition its economic growth has brought to the United States. Doing that conveniently deflects blame from the corporate employers who made the decision to move production from the United States to China. As usual, all social blame or criticism must be kept from touching the U.S. capitalist system that accounts for those profit-driven decisions. Deep, costly, and lasting consequences have followed the demagoguery and divisions in societies that split over immigration. Much energy, time, and money is diverted from dealing with the nation's real economic problems to obsessive 'coping with' immigration (homeland security budgets, border patrol budgets, and wall construction and maintenance). Still more is devoted to housing, policing, feeding, and otherwise 'processing' undocumented immigrants. If high-priority policy instead created good jobs with good incomes for immigrants, huge portions of these social costs would be unnecessary. Moreover, worthwhile alternatives to failed existing immigration policies are available if sufficient political power places them on the social and political agendas of societies confronting immigration. A remarkable flaw of today's global capitalism lies in its provocation of massive migration of people alongside its massive, costly failure to plan or manage that migration. One such alternative policy could solve together the recurring problems of unemployment, inadequate housing and social services, and immigration. In the U.S. case, another Marshall Plan or 'Inclusive' New Deal, green or otherwise, is needed. It could create jobs performing public services (paid at or above the current median for such jobs) that would be provided, as a right, to every unemployed citizen as priority #1. As priority #2, equivalent jobs would be provided, as a right, to all immigrants. As priority #3, the jobs thus created would include expanding the housing and all other social services needed to adequately accommodate the entire population, native plus immigrant. The tragic social divisiveness of immigrant-vs-native competition for jobs might thereby be sharply reduced. Such an Inclusive New Deal could be funded by (1) billions of dollars no longer needed for unemployment insurance, (2) increased income and other taxes paid by newly employed native and immigrant workers, (3) increased taxes paid by businesses profiting from increased spending by those workers, and (4) an annual wealth tax of 2 percent on all personal wealth above $20 million. Immigration could be reduced for the first five years of this Inclusive New Deal to get it fully established and running. A major side benefit of this Inclusive New Deal would be the huge boost in receipts for Social Security. Another such benefit would be the reduced demands placed on social services by the better physical and mental health of all newly employed workers. Finally, as a social dividend from such an Inclusive New Deal, the official work week in the United States for all workers could be reduced from 40 to 36 hours (with no pay reduction). Imagine the enormous social benefits that would accrue to the entire U.S. population, native and immigrant, from this different reformist approach to the immigration issue. In the United States and beyond, such an approach would reduce the social divisions over jobs, incomes, housing, homelessness, social services, and immigration. A strong, growing economy attracts immigrants, integrates them productively, and thereby impresses the world. A weak, declining economy not only fails to employ all its people productively but by deporting immigrants advertises its failure to the world. A radical program would embrace the freedom to migrate as universal and therefore reorient the global location of investment to serve that freedom both domestically and internationally.

Seoul Confirms Casualties Among North Korean Troops In Russia	By Taejun Kang South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, or NIS, said on Monday it had 'specific intelligence' that North Korean forces in Russia had suffered casualties but it did not comment on a media report that 500 North Koreans had been killed in a Ukrainian attack with British missiles. The U.S. and South Korea have said that North Korean troops had been fighting against Ukrainian forces in Kursk. The U.S. has estimated more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to Kursk and they had begun combat operations alongside Russian forces. Neither Russia nor North Korea have confirmed the presence of North Korean troops. Videos circulated by pro-Russian war bloggers indicated that up to 12 British Storm Shadow missiles struck a target believed to be a command headquarters in the village of Maryno on Wednesday. The site might have been used by North Korean and Russian officers, the defense news publisher Global Defense Corp reported. South Korea’s NIS, while confirming it had 'specific intelligence' to confirm North Korean casualties, did not provide any estimated casualty toll. It said it was closely monitoring the situation. Separately, The Wall Street Journal, citing Western officials, said the attack on the command headquarters also killed one high-level North Korean official. Ukraine’s military confirmed the use of the British missile, while Britain has not commented. Anti-air missiles, air defense equipment South Korea’s top security adviser said that in exchange for sending its troops to help Russia, North Korea had received anti-air missiles and other air defense equipment. 'Russia is believed to have provided equipment and anti-air missiles to strengthen Pyongyang’s vulnerable air defense system,' National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik said during an interview with the South Korean broadcaster SBS on Friday. 'Following North Korea’s failed military spy satellite launch on May 27, Russia had already declared its intention to support satellite-related technologies [to the North], and it reportedly supplied various military technologies,' Shin said. 'We believe that there has also been economic aid in various forms,' he added. When asked about the possibility of the Russia-Ukraine war expanding into a wider war, Shin said it was unlikely. 'Especially, it is very difficult for Russia to actually use nuclear weapons,' Shin said. On the possibility of North Korea sending additional troops to Russia, Shin said: 'We cannot completely rule that out, but we have no confirmed information at this stage.' 'Russia currently does not have the multiple rocket launcher system and it remains to be seen whether all or part of the operational troops will go, but if all the assigned personnel were to go, it would be around 4,000 people at most,' he explained. The NIS confirmed last week that North Korea had exported additional artillery ammunition and launchers to Russia, including 170-millimeter self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm multiple rocket launchers, which raised a speculation that Pyongyang might send an additional artillery unit to Russia. Russian warning Russia warned that it would respond strongly if South Korea supplies lethal weapons to Ukraine, saying it would 'fully destroy relations between the two countries.' 'Seoul must realize that the possible use of South Korean weapons to kill Russian citizens will fully destroy relations between our countries,' said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko in an interview with state news agency TASS on Sunday. 'Of course, we will respond in every way that we find necessary. It is unlikely that this will strengthen the security of the Republic of Korea itself.' The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s official name. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said in a press conference on Nov. 7 that while Seoul had provided humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine, the situation has changed with the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. 'If the North Korean military gains experience in modern warfare, it could become a critical problem for our security,' said Yoon. 'So we will now change the support method from the previous humanitarian nature to match the level of involvement of the North Korean military. We will not rule out weapons support to Ukraine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGCaFXCh3gpZL	2024-11-25T15:44:56-08:00	
Pakistan: Civilian Carnage – Analysis	By Ajit Kumar Singh On November 21, 2024, terrorists opened fire on a passenger convoy in the Kurram District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) killing at least 38 persons and injuring 11. At the time of writing, the death toll had risen to 43. The convoy of around 200 vehicles, carrying Shia passengers between Peshawar and Parachinar, came under heavy gunfire in the densely populated Bagan town. Kurram Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud disclosed that 'two separate convoys of members of the Shia community … were targeted by the terrorists in the Kurram district… both convoys consisted of around 40 vehicles travelling under police escort.' Soon after the terrorist attack, clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram. 'The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,' said an unnamed local administration official, adding, 'Among the deceased 16 were Sunni, while 66 belonged to the Shia community.' Meanwhile, the worst previous attack targeting civilians was recorded on September 29, 2023, when at least 55 persons were killed while another 100 were injured in a suicide blast targeting a 12th Rabiul Awwal procession near Madina Masjid at Alfalah Road in Mastung town (Mastung District), Balochistan. Mastung Assistant Commissioner Atta-ul-Munim had said that the explosion took place when people were gathering for the procession. The target were people of the Barelvi sub-sect of Sunni Muslims. Some of the other prominent attacks, each with 25 or more civilian fatalities, in Pakistan since the launch of the operation Zarb-e-Azb [Sword of the Prophet] on June 15, 2014, included: July 30, 2023: At least 54 people, including a Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) local leader, were killed and more than 100 sustained injuries in a suicide blast at the JUI-F workers' convention on Shanday Morr near the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) office in the Khar town of Bajaur District in KP. March 4, 2022: At least 57 worshippers lost their lives and 194 were injured when a suicide attacker detonated his explosives inside a Shia Mosque in the Koocha Risaldar area of Peshawar, the provincial capital of KP. Later, the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) claimed the suicide bombing. November 23, 2018: At least 33 people, including 22 Shias, were killed and more than 51 were injured in a suicide attack in the crowded marketplace near an Imambargah (Shia place of worship) in the Juma Bazar (Friday Market) of Kalaya town in the Lower Orakzai District of KP. July 13, 2018: A suicide bomber targeting a political rally of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) killed at least 128 people and injured over 200 in the Dringarh village of Mastung District. Both IS-KP and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP )'s 'Ghazi Force Lal Masjid' wing claimed responsibility for the attack. May 12, 2017: At least 27 people were killed and 40, including Senate Deputy Chairman Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Haideri's convoy in Mastung town, Mastung District, Balochistan. February 16, 2017: At least 76 people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked the crowded Sufi shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the Sehwan Sharif town of Sehwan District in Sindh, injuring up to another 250. The blast took place inside the premises of the shrine as a dhamaal (meditative dance) was taking place, with a large number of women and children among the casualties. Devotees throng the shrine of the revered Sufi saint every Thursday to participate in a dhamaal and prayers. The IS-KP claimed responsibility for the attack. September 16, 2016: A suicide bomber killed at least 28 people and wounded more than 45 while they attended Friday prayers at a mosque in the Pekhan Killay area of Anbar tehsil (revenue unit) in the then Mohmand Agency of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Jama'at-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a breakaway faction of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. August 8, 2016: At least 70 persons were killed and over 100 were wounded in a suicide bombing at the emergency ward of Quetta's Civil Hospital, where scores of people had gathered to mourn the death of Balochistan Bar Association (BBA) President Bilal Anwar Kasi in a gun attack earlier in the day. Law enforcement officials said that the two attacks were connected and the blast was carried out by a suicide bomber. Fifty-five of the 70 dead were lawyers, including BBA's former President Baz Muhammad Kakar, former Supreme Court Bar Association Vice-President Syed Qahir Shah, Advocate Sangat Jamaldani, son of Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) Secretary General Jahanzeb Jamaldani, and Advocate Dawood Lasi, son of Former Federal Minister Abdul Malik Kasi. March 27, 2016: At least 72 people were killed and more than 300 injured when a suicide bomber ripped through the parking space in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park situated near Allama Iqbal Town in Lahore, Punjab, while Christians were celebrating Easter. JuA claimed responsibility for the attack, with a spokesperson declaring, 'We claim responsibility for the attack on Christians as they were celebrating Easter.' December 29, 2015: At least 26 people were killed and 50 were injured as a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near a NADRA office located on the link road in the Mardan town of Mardan District in KP. The explosion ripped through the front entrance of the regional branch of NADRA. JuA claimed responsibility for the attack. December 13, 2015: At least 25 persons were killed and 62 injured when a device containing about 35 kilograms of explosives ripped through a makeshift market in Parachinar town of Kurram Agency in FATA. Officials disclosed that the device, kept in a sack, exploded when a large number of people were buying second-hand clothes. Two militant groups - Lashkar-e-Jhangvi Al-Alami (LeJ International) and Ansarul Mujahideen (based in South Waziristan Agency) - claimed responsibility for the attack, with one of them (LeJ) asserting that the target was the Shia community. May 13, 2015: At least 47 Ismaili Shias were killed and another 24 were injured when unidentified militants opened fire in the Safora Chowrangi area near Dow Medical College in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Town, Karachi, Sindh. January 30, 2015: At least 61 Shias were killed and 50 were injured in a bomb explosion at Karbala Maula Imambargah in the Lakhi Dar area of Shikarpur District, Sindh. Jundullah, a splinter group of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. Fahad Marwat, Jundullah 'spokesperson', declared, 'Our target was the Shia community… They are our enemies,'. December 16, 2014: At least 148 persons, including 132 children, nine school staff members and all seven suicide attackers, were killed when TTP militants stormed and opened fire at the Army Public School located on Warsak Road in the provincial capital, Peshawar. TTP claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that the attack was in retaliation to military operations in the North Waziristan and Khyber Agencies of FATA. November 2, 2014: At least 60 people, including children and women, were killed and more than 150 were injured when a suicide bomber detonated his suicide vest in a parking area, about 500 meters from the Wagah Border on the Pakistan side. Giving details about the incident, the then Inspector General Police (IGP) Punjab, Pakistan, Mushtaq Ahmad Sukhera, stated, 'A large number of people were returning after watching Rangers flag ceremony at Wagah border when a suicide bomber blew himself up near one of the exit gates.' Of these 17 incidents, nine were sectarian attacks. Since June 15, 2014, in 178 such incidents, at least 762 civilians have been killed, and another 979 have been injured. Such attacks have led to increased animosities between sectarian groups and led to several clashes. For instance, hours after the November 21, 2024, attack (above), deadly clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram which resulted in at least 39 deaths. The clashes continued till November 23 late night. Though 'both sides have agreed to a seven-day ceasefire, during which they will also exchange prisoners and return bodies to one another' as disclosed by Muhammad Ali Saif, spokesperson for the KP Government on November 24, given the fraught ties, particularly over the past few months, between the two sides, the ceasefire is unlikely to last longer. Notably, over 150 have been killed in such clashes in the region over the past five months. Meanwhile, overall civilian fatalities in terrorist violence have been on a continuous rise since 2020, after declining to 142 in 2019. Fatalities in this category increased to 169 in 2020, 215 in 2021, 229 in 2022 and 386 in 2023. At least 561 civilians have already been killed with over a month still left in 2024, the highest since 2015, when there were 866 such fatalities. Significantly, then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had had declared, in the National Assembly, on June 16, 2014, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb had been launched against terrorism and it would continue till its final objective of the restoration of peace and tranquillity in Pakistan had been obtained. 'I am confident the operation will be the harbinger of peace and security for Pakistan,' he asserted. As SAIR had noted then, 'Such vaunting declarations are not a novelty in Pakistan, but are difficult to reconcile with the country's broader strategic design and continuing exploitation of terrorism as an instrument, both of domestic political management and external strategic projection… In all probability, Operation Zarb-e-Azb will also come to an end sooner rather than later, without any decisive gains. The military may bring away the illusion that the terrorist assault at Karachi has been 'avenged', but the capacities and intentions of the terrorists are unlikely to be impacted in any significant measure.' Indeed, Operation Zarb-e-Azb has ended and so have other operations that followed , but terrorism continues to thrive in Pakistan. The hapless citizenry is unlikely to receive any respite in a situation where the Security Forces are themselves under increased threat, with over 636 SF personnel already killed in 2024, the highest in a year since 2013 (665).

India: Shadow From The Past In Punjab – Analysis	By Ruchika Kakkar On November 12, 2024, Shimla Singh, a terrorist associated with the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF), was arrested in the Mansa District of Punjab. Gaurav Yadav, Director General of Police (DGP), Punjab, disclosed that Shimla Singh confessed to his role in the grenade attack at the Jio Petrol Pump on Sirsa Road in Mansa District, in the intervening night of October 26-27, 2024. Shimla Singh revealed that he received the grenade from Garhshankar in the Hoshiarpur District of Punjab, on the instructions of KTF's current 'chief' Arshdeep Singh aka Arsh Dala. No casualty was reported in the incident. On November 10, 2024, DGP Yadav announced on X, the arrest of two key KTF terrorists - Anmol Preet Singh aka Vishal, and Navjot Singh aka Neetu - near Kharar in the Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar District of Punjab. The accused were involved in the murder of Gurpreet Singh Hari Nau in Faridkot, Punjab, on October 9, 2024. Investigations revealed their role in the killing of Jaswant Singh Gill on November 7, 2024, in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, under Arsh Dala's instructions. On October 24, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Baljeet Singh aka Baljeet Maur, an absconding KTF member, from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) in Delhi. Investigations revealed that he was involved in extortion, recruitment of new cadres, as well as terrorist funding to India-based associates. On May 2, 2024, Police arrested four KTF members for allegedly making an extortion demand of INR five million from a resident in the Muktsar District of Punjab. One .32-bore pistol, four cartridges, five cell phones, a scooter and a car, were seized from them. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since February 17, 2023, at least 15 KTF operatives/associates have been arrested across India (data till November 22, 2024), including 10 such arrests in 2024. In a press release dated February 17, 2023, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) declared KTF as a militant outfit, noting, 'It is a militant outfit and it aims to revive terrorism in Punjab. It challenges the territorial integrity, unity, national security and sovereignty of India and promotes various acts of terrorism, including targeted killings in Punjab.' KTF has collaborated with jihadist groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ), to plot attacks in Punjab. In 2014, KTF and LeT planned to airdrop militants into Pathankot using a German-imported glider, though the mission failed due to technical issues. KTF remains active in attempting bombings, armed attacks, and targeting VIPs in Punjab, often coordinating with Pakistan-based jihadi elements. Some of the recent killings (apart from the two mentioned above) in which the role of KTF-linked operatives is suspected included: September 18, 2023: Congress leader Baljinder Singh Balli (45), was killed in Moga, Punjab. Arsh Dala claimed responsibility for the attack through a Facebook post.January 31, 2021: Hindu Priest Kamaldeep Sharma was killed by Kamaljeet Sharma and Ram Singh aka Sonain, in Jalandhar District, Punjab, on the directions of Arsh Dala and the then KTF 'chief' Hardeep Singh Nijjar. November 20, 2020: A member of Dera Sacha Sauda, Manohar Lal Arora, was killed at Bhagta Bhai Ka village in the Bathinda District of Punjab. An NIA First Information Report dated February 13, 2024, inter alia, observed, 'KTF terror associates have conspired to smuggle arms and ammunition into India, raise funds for activities of KTF through extortion and carry out targeted killings to create terror in the minds of the people of Punjab. They are also involved in the recruitment of persons into KTF for carrying out their terrorist activities… The KTF operatives are working in close collaboration with the Bambiha criminal gang to use the network including resources and logistics of the gang for the commission of terrorist and criminal activities in India… ' The Bambiha criminal gang which used to operate in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan has recently started operating in Delhi. 'Founded' by Davinder Bambiha who was killed in an encounter with police in 2016, it is currently led by Gaurav aka Lucky Patial, who is either in the United States or Armenia. The NIA is investigating at least seven KTF-linked cases. It has filed charge sheets in all these seven cases, against 31 persons. The KTF was founded in 2011 by Jagtar Singh Tara, a former Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) militant involved in the assassination of the then Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh on August 31, 1995. After escaping from Chandigarh's Burail Jail in 2004, Jagtar Singh fled to Pakistan, and later moved to Thailand to establish a militant training base. He was arrested in Thailand in 2015 and deported to India, after which he revealed ISI's role in shifting Khalistani training operations to Thailand. Supported by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), KTF is one of four militant groups, including BKI, Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), and Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), that spearhead ISI-backed violence in Punjab. Based in Pakistan, KTF has supporters in a number of countries, prominently including Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Thailand and USA. It is financially supported by ISI and linked to other various Khalistani leaders, including Rattandeep Singh and Resham Singh. Nijjar, who joined KTF in 2013 and was radicalized by Tara, became the chief of KTF after Jagtar Singh Tara's re-arrest. Nijjar was allegedly groomed by the ISI, who gave him arms and explosives training in 2012 and 2013, and subsequently worked doe the revival of KTF. Nijjar was declared a designated terrorist through a UMHA notification dated July 1, 2022, which, inter alia, read, Hardeep Singh Nijjar is chief of Khalistan Tiger Force… and is actively involved in operationalizing, networking, training and financing Khalistan Tiger Force module members… Nijjar is accused in various cases registered and being investigated by the Punjab Police… the Central Government believes that Hardeep Singh Nijjar is involved in terrorism and Hardeep Singh Nijjar is to be notified as a terrorist… On June 18, 2023, (8.27pm local time), Canada-based Nijjar was shot dead by two unidentified youth outside the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, in the British Columbia Province of Canada. Nijjar's assassination has become a major point of contention between India and Canada. Arsh Dala succeeded Nijjar as the 'chief' od KTF. A UMHA notification of January 9, 2023, designated Dala a terrorist, observing Dala 'is associated with Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF)' and 'is very close to Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist and runs terror modules on behalf of him.' Arsh Dala is reported to have been arrested in Canada following a shooting incident in Milton Town, Ontario, on October 28, 2024. On October 29, the Halton Regional Police Service (HRPS) disclosed that it had arrested two men on charges of 'discharging firearm with intent', after the duo had come to a hospital and one of them was treated for a non-life-threatening gunshot wound and later discharged. Though It did not disclose their identity, both accused 'were held in custody pending a bail hearing.' It later emerged that the injured party was Dala. Meanwhile, India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, 'We have seen media reports circulating since 10 November on the arrest in Canada of proclaimed offender Arsh Singh Gill aka Arsh Dala, the de-facto chief of the Khalistan Tiger Force. Canadian print and visual media have widely reported on the arrest… In view of the recent arrest, our agencies will be following up on an extradition request. Given Arsh Dala's criminal record in India and his involvement in similar illegal activities in Canada, it is expected that he will be extradited or deported to face justice in India.' However, given the current status of Indo-Canadian ties, it is quite unlikely that Dala will be extradited at any time in the near future. Whatever may happen in the case of extradition, it is quite clear that the threat emerging out of Canadian soil in the form of Khalistani terrorism/extremism and its linkages to gangsterism, including the threats arising from KTF, have been growing in recent times. Given the fraught relations between New Delhi and Ottawa since the Nijjar allegations, significant counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries will remain unlikely. If diplomatic pressure is to be increased on Canada to act against the Khalistani gangster-terrorist networks, India will have to address their manifestation on its own soil, as well as the many deficits in enforcement, investigation and prosecution that impede international cooperation on these issues.

Spain’s Center-Right ‘Foolish’ To Think EPP Would Upset EU Allian...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- Spain's Partido Popular (PP) was foolish if it thought that European People's Party (EPP) leader Manfred Weber would break the grand coalition with the S&D and Liberals in the European Parliament in exchange for torpedoing future commissioner Teresa Ribera, Ignacio Molina, an expert on EU politics, told Euractiv.es. Molina is a senior researcher and EU policy expert at the Real Instituto Elcano, one of Spain's most prestigious think tanks. After a tense week in which the formation of the second European Commission, headed by Ursula von der Leyen, was up in the air because of the PP's veto on Ribera, the grand coalition of the EPP and the Socialist Group (S&D) with the Liberals has been saved, but at the cost of many wounds, Molina warned. 'If the PP really thought that they were capable of convincing the EPP to veto Ribera and thus break the grand coalition, they were really fooling themselves,' Molina told Euractiv.es. An agreement was finally announced last Wednesday between the EPP, S&D, and Renew Europe leaders, paving the way for the second von der Leyen team to be sworn in this week. Ribera will be the future commissioner for competition and vice president for a clean, fair, and competitive transition. 'It is likely that this week, the PP will abstain (in the vote on the new Commission). We will have to see to what extent they maintain their hard-line or accept the path of pragmatism which Weber has imposed by not wanting to break the grand coalition with the S&D group,' Molina stressed. According to the expert, although the PSOE and the PP have on many occasions coordinated their positions and voted together in the European Parliament, in the case of Ribera, the positions have become highly polarised, weakening this 'unity', which does not exist in Madrid, Molina recalled. No breaking of the status quo 'They (the PP) have taken political advantage of the floods (in Valencia and Castilla-La Mancha). But the attempt to erode Ribera came long before the catastrophe occurred. When (parliamentary) hearings were being prepared, the appearance of the new vice-presidents was left until the end because of rumours in Madrid that the PP was going to weaken her or even try to have her rejected,' Molina added. He recalled that 'since 1999, the European Parliament has always eliminated a commissioner candidate'. In 2014, the PSOE voted against former energy and climate action commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete (PP), who served in Brussels between 2014 and 2019. In the days before the 'white smoke' announcement for the new European Commission last Wednesday, the PP maintained a hard line. The party's spokesperson in Brussels, Dolors Montserrat, reaffirmed the formation's total rejection of Ribera. But despite the PP's now-dashed hopes, Molina believes that Weber never intended to break the alliance with the S&D and the Liberals. 'Weber wanted to please the PP, but he never wanted to destroy the grand coalition,' Molina said. 'Did anything justify Weber making things very difficult for Teresa Ribera? The answer is yes. But would he have gone so far as to break up the grand coalition? The answer is a clear no,' the expert added. In the same vein, the Elcano researcher recalled that despite a personal rivalry between von der Leyen and Weber, both from the CDU/CSU, one of the reasons that - in theory - could have partly justified Weber torpedoing Ribera, 'he cannot do whatever he wants'. Bleeding wounds in the wake of a fierce ideological battle Weber’s approach was: 'Let's listen to the PP by hindering the ‘anti-nuclear’ Ribera as much as possible, and maybe we can even get (Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro) Sánchez to change his candidate. That would be good for us' but, in reality, 'Weber was never willing to risk breaking the current status quo', Molina said. According to the expert, Weber never wanted to break the grand coalition because that would have meant 'falling into the hands of the far right (including the Patriots for Europe group). It was a very well-considered and rational decision on Weber's part.' However, although the PP did not topple Ribera, the future Spanish commissioner ‘has sweated blood this week. And that is not a bad thing for the EPP group,' Molina added. Moreover, according to the Elcano expert, the battle between the PSOE and the PP in Brussels 'will leave wounds' between the two parties, which until now have almost always voted as a united bloc on major issues affecting Spanish interests. The 'Ribera case' means that 'trust between PP and PSOE MEPs has been badly damaged, and this is a novelty because until now, the polarisation of Spanish political disputes has not usually been exported to Brussels.' 'With everything that has happened last week, things have changed and will leave scars on both parties,' Molina also warned.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGFL45X0am235	2024-11-25T15:38:08-08:00	
The Roadmap To A Just Peace In Palestine – OpEd	A major problem in American thinking relating to the Middle East is the utter rejection of the notion that Palestinian rights are fundamental, if even relevant at all, to the coveted peace and stability. In the years before the Trump administration’s so-called deal of the century was officially revealed on Jan. 28, 2020, successive US administrations had attempted to 'stabilize' the Middle East at the expense of the Palestinians. Earlier plans, or deals, rested on the premise of total marginalization of the Palestinian people and their cause. They included the Rogers Plan of 1969 and the Second Rogers Plan the following year, which culminated in the Camp David Accords of 1978. When all such plans failed to subdue the Palestinians, Israel and the US began investing in an alternative Palestinian leadership that would be compliant with Tel Aviv’s will, often in exchange for money and a minimal share of power. The outcome was the Oslo Accords of the mid-1990s, which initially segmented the Palestinians politically, yielding competing classes, but ultimately failed to defeat their quest for freedom. Numerous other initiatives and plans, mostly proposed by the US and other Western entities, tried to conclude the Palestinian struggle in favor of Israel without having to deal with the inconveniences of pressuring it to respect international law. They all failed. The 2020 deal was another failed attempt. It was centered on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s previously thwarted economic peace of 2009. For Israel, this new attempt was meant to be a win-win scenario: ending Israel’s regional isolation, amassing wealth, making the Israeli military occupation permanent and avoiding any accountability under international law, thus permanently defeating the Palestinians. The ongoing Israeli war and genocide in Gaza, the destabilization of the whole region and the ongoing Palestinian steadfastness and resistance are the final proof that there can never be real peace in the Middle East without justice for the Palestinians and other victims of Israeli brutality. No matter how many US-Western deals and initiatives are proposed in the future, this fact will not be altered. The same applies to those operating in a less official capacity but who are still committed to the same perusal of creative 'solutions' to the so-called conflict. Such notions may suggest that the lack of a solution reflects a lack of imagination and resolve or a dearth of legal texts that make a just end to the conflict impossible. However, a solution is readily available. Indeed, the solution to military occupation, apartheid and genocide is ending military occupation, dismantling the racist apartheid regime and holding Israeli war criminals accountable for their extermination of Palestinians. Not only do we have enough international and humanitarian laws and court orders to guide us through the process of holding Israel accountable, but also more than the needed critical mass of international consensus that should make this 'solution' possible. The main obstacle is the stubborn and unconditional US support of Israel, which has allowed the latter to flout international law and consensus for decades. International law regarding Palestine is not an outdated solution but a robust and growing legal discourse that refuses to entertain any Israeli or US interpretation of the war crimes, including the crime of genocide, underway in Gaza and the rest of the Occupied Territories. In February, the International Court of Justice held hearings that allowed representatives of more than 50 countries to articulate their political, legal and moral stances on the Israeli occupation of Palestine. While the acting legal adviser at the US State Department arguedthat the 15-judge panel at The Hague should not call for Israel’s withdrawal from the West Bank, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s legal adviser contended that the Palestinians’ 'use of force to resist oppression is an inalienable right.' In July, the court issued a landmark ruling that the Israeli occupation in all of its expressions is illegal under international law and that such illegality includes Israel’s occupation of East Jerusalem and all of its Jewish-only settlements, annexation attempts, theft of natural resources and so on. In September, international consensus was achieved again, as the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Israel end 'its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' within 12 months. This is a mere footnote in the massive body of international law regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Yet more is regularly being added to the already clear discourse, including last week’s issuing of arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court for top Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu. With such clarity in mind, why then should Palestinians, Arabs and the international community entertain or engage in any new deals, plans or solutions that operate outside the realms of international law and standards? The issue is obviously not the lack of a roadmap to a just peace, but the lack of interest or will to implement it, specifically on the part of the US and a few of its Western allies. It is their relentless backing of Israel and financing of its war machine that makes a just solution in Palestine unattainable, at least for now. As far as Palestinians are concerned, there can only be one acceptable deal: one that is predicated on the full implementation of international law, including the Palestinian people’s right of return and right to self-determination. The continued US-Israeli attempts to circumvent this fact will never impede Palestinians from carrying on with their struggle for freedom.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGGogoS9DTmbc	2024-11-25T15:35:23-08:00	
Philippine President’s Office: VP Duterte Could Be Prosecuted For...	By Jason Gutierrez The feud between Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice-President Sara Duterte has taken an astonishing turn with Marcos vowing to 'fight back' after his No. 2 openly warned that he would be assassinated should she be targeted and killed. Duterte’s public threats made over the weekend were being investigated, and if the evidence warranted it, she could be prosecuted, the Presidential Communications Office said, citing the Philippine justice department. President Marcos did not name his vice-president in a video conveying his response to her threats, but he termed as 'reckless' what he said were threatening statements that endangered the Philippines’ leadership. 'The statements we heard in the previous days were troubling. There is the reckless use of profanities and threats to kill some of us,' Marcos said in his video message on Monday. 'I will fight back,' he said, adding that 'such criminal' statements must not be ignored. 'If it’s that easy to plan the assassination of a president, how much [easier to plan against] ordinary citizens,' Marcos said. The Marcos and Duterte families had joined hands in an alliance to win the general election two years ago, but the partnership ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the government to allow an international investigation into the drug war waged by Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, Sara’s father. Duterte on Saturday said in an online press briefing that she had hired 'someone' to eliminate Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta and House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, in the event that she might be assassinated. 'No joke,' Sara Duterte said. Vice President Duterte later tried to walk back her remarks, saying they were hypothetical. In a statement Monday, she said that her remarks had been 'maliciously taken out of logical context.' The vice-president’s threats came after Zuleika Lopez, her chief of staff, was detained for contempt by the House. The House good government committee said it had found that Lopez was trying to hamper an inquiry into the vice-president’s alleged misuse of 125 million pesos (U.S. $2.12 million) from her budget as the VP and former education secretary. On Saturday, the Presidential Security Command issued a statement saying it had 'heightened and strengthened its security protocols.' 'Any threat to the life of the president and the first Family, regardless of its origin – and especially one made so brazenly in public – is treated with the utmost seriousness,' the statement said. 'We consider this a matter of national security and shall take all necessary measures to ensure the president’s safety.' ‘Not a normal statement’ On Monday, House Speaker Romualdez described the threats made by the vice-president as 'both alarming and unprecedented.' 'Let me be clear. This is no longer a joke. This is not a normal statement,' he said in a speech. 'This is a threat to our democracy, to our government, and the security of our nation.' Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), said it would subpoena Vice President Duterte as part of an investigation into her remarks at the press conference where she made the threats against Marcos. The NBI is the investigating arm of the justice department. The Vice President would be asked 'to appear within five days from today' to explain her remarks, NBI Director Jaime Santiago said. Were Duterte to ignore the subpoena, the bureau would commence its investigation using any legal evidence it had, Santiago said. 'Any and all threats against the life of the president shall be validated and considered a matter of national security,' National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said in a statement on Sunday. 'We underscore that the safety of the President is a non-partisan issue.'

Horn Of Africa Forum Opens In Djibouti Amid Ethiopia-Somalia Tens...	By Mohamed Olad Hassan Somali scholars, politicians and traditional leaders from across the Horn of Africa gathered in Djibouti on Monday for a three-day forum on strengthening regional stability. The annual forum, the eighth of its kind, was organized by the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies in Somalia, an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Mogadishu. Mursal Saney, executive director of the institute, said the forum is providing an opportunity for Somalis from across the region to discuss issues of concern. 'We have invited nearly 300 delegates including regional experts to provide them an opportunity to discuss and exhibit constructive ideas on how the Horn of Africa region can strengthen its stability and the importance of rule of law,' Saney said. This year’s forum comes at a time of growing tension between Somalia and Ethiopia over a port deal Addis Ababa signed in January with Somaliland, a breakaway region. Mogadishu sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia. The deal so far, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, gives landlocked Ethiopia a 50-year lease for a Red Sea port from Somaliland in exchange for possible recognition of Somaliland’s independence. The deal has angered Mogadishu, which has described it as an assault on Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ethiopia maintains that it does not infringe on Somalia's sovereignty. Somaliland declared its independence from the rest of Somalia in 1991, following the collapse of the military government led by late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Somalia has never accepted Somaliland’s secession, nor has Somaliland received international recognition. In July and August, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal. The issue has raised fears of fresh conflict in the Horn of Africa region. 'Because of its strategic location in the region and the fact that it is coming out of a conflict era, Somalia is thirsty for peace and regional stability, respecting the international law and the rule of law,' Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi said at the start of the forum. Also on Monday, Mumin Hassan Barre, Djibouti’s minister of justice and religion, said experts attending the forum should contribute to the well-being of the region. 'We see experts that know the region well, and I think the peace, stability and the solution of the region’s problems lie in the hands of its people, including the experts who gathered here,' Barre said. Somalis representing Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia are attending the event, as well as those from across the region and the diaspora communities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Mohamed Sheikh Nor contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGMQUuQCeZiyG	2024-11-25T15:31:09-08:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Intensify In Lebanon Amid Rumors Of Imminent C...	By Najia Houssari Israeli attacks on targets in Lebanon intensified on Monday, as rumors circulated in Tel Aviv and Beirut about the possibility of a ceasefire agreement within two days. US envoy Amos Hochstein has been leading complex negotiations between Israeli and Lebanese authorities with the aim of ending the conflict, which began on Sep. 23 with Israeli airstrikes, followed by ground incursions into border areas on Oct. 1. Since then, Israel has assassinated senior Hezbollah leaders, and the confirmed death toll from the fighting stands at about 3,800. This figure does not include Hezbollah members killed on the battlefield, the numbers of which are difficult to ascertain because of intense shelling in southern areas. The escalating war has also resulted in the destruction of thousands of residential and commercial buildings in areas stretching from the south of the country to the southern suburbs of Beirut and northern Bekaa. Tensions continue to run high as the population lives in fear of the intense airstrikes, with ambulances and fire trucks remaining on standby in all regions. MP Elias Bou Saab, the deputy speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, said: 'We are optimistic about a ceasefire and there is hope. But nothing can be confirmed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. What might put pressure on him is the battlefield.' Israeli aggression intensifies whenever peace negotiations move closer to an agreement, he added, in an attempt to put pressure on Lebanese authorities. 'We insist on our position regarding the inclusion of France in the committee overseeing the ceasefire implementation,' said Bou Saab. 'We did not hear anything about Israel’s freedom of movement in Lebanon, and we still speak only about UN Resolution 1701, with no additions and with an implementation mechanism.' Resolution 1701 was adopted by the Security Council in 2006 with the aim of resolving the conflict that year between Israel and Hezbollah. It calls for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, the withdrawal of Hezbollah and other forces from parts of the country south of the Litani River, and the disarmament of Hezbollah and other armed groups. News channel CNN quoted a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister as saying talks were moving toward a ceasefire. Another regional source told the network: 'The agreement is closer than ever. However, it has not been fully finalized yet.' Israel’s ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, said an agreement 'could happen in a few days' but 'there are still some sticking points that need to be resolved.' The Israeli Broadcasting Authority quoted the country’s education minister as saying that Hochstein has the green light to proceed with an agreement. It added that a deal with Lebanon had been finalized and Netanyahu was considering 'how to explain it to the public.' Also on Monday, diplomat Dan Shapiro from the US Department of Defense held meetings with senior Israeli officials that focused on the members of a proposed committee to monitor the ceasefire, most notably the participation of France, and the details of a monitoring mechanism to be led by the US. One report suggested Washington had agreed to provide Israel with a guarantee it would support any military action in response to threats from Lebanon and to disrupt any Hezbollah presence along the border. According to news website Axios, the draft agreement for a ceasefire includes a 60-day transitional period during which the Israeli army would withdraw from southern Lebanon, to be replaced by the Lebanese army in areas close to the border, and Hezbollah would move its heavy weapons from the border region to areas north of the Litani Line. Against this backdrop of peace negotiations, the continual Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut intensified on Monday, following 10 strikes the previous evening. The attacks targeted Haret Hreik, Hadath, Ghobeiry, Bir Al-Abed and Sfeir. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and as Arab News visited targeted areas, residents said 'there have never been any Hezbollah offices in these structures, neither now nor in the past, and the buildings are mainly for residential purposes.' A lawyer called Imad said the apartment building in the Hadath area in which he lived collapsed when it was hit by an airstrike. 'It is unbelievable that they use Hezbollah as a pretext to destroy our homes, which we purchased through financial loans to provide shelter for our families. They intend to annihilate us all,' he said. The Israeli army said on Monday that an airstrike that hit the Basta area of central Beirut early on Saturday had 'targeted a command center affiliated with Hezbollah.' Efforts to help the injured and recover the bodies of the dead continued at the scene of the attack until Sunday evening. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 29 people were killed and 67 wounded. The Israeli army also carried out numerous airstrikes in southern Lebanon, mainly targeting the cities of Tyre and Nabatieh. Ten people were killed, including a woman and a member of the Lebanese army, and 17 injured in three airstrikes on Tyre. Also in Tyre, an Israeli drone killed a motorcycle rider in a parking lot near the Central Bank of Lebanon. And three civilians were killed by an airstrike in the town of Ghazieh, south of Sidon. From the southern border to the northern banks of the Litani River, no area has been spared from Israeli airstrikes, which have extended as far north as the city of Baalbek, and the town of Hermel close to the border with Syria. In the east, back-and-forth operations between the Israeli army and Hezbollah continued as the former attempted to gain control over the town of Khiam. Its forces advanced, supported by Merkava tanks, from the southern outskirts under the cover of airstrikes and artillery bombardment, moving into the center of the town and toward Ebel Al-Saqi and Jdidet Marjeyoun. The Israeli army also deployed tanks between olive groves in the town of Deir Mimas after an incursion into the town last week. It began advancing toward the Tal Nahas-Kfar Kila-Qlayaa triangle. Elsewhere, Hezbollah and Israeli forces clashed in the western sector of the Maroun Al-Ras-Ainata-Bint Jbeil triangle. Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli army positions on the outskirts of the towns of Shamaa and Biyada. Israeli forces carried out house-demolition operations in Shamaa. Hezbollah also continued to launch attacks against northern Israel. The group said its rockets 'reached the Shraga base, north of the city of Acre, and targeted an Israeli army gathering in the settlement of Meron.' Israeli medical services said one person was injured in Nahariya by falling fragments from a rocket.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGPdHMO9eLl5Q	2024-11-25T15:28:49-08:00	
Persecution Of The Press Is The New Normal In Bongbong’s Philippi...	By Danilo Araña Arao The Philippines is one of the most dangerous places to practice journalism not just in Asia, but in the entire world. Members of the media are often smeared as communists, arbitrarily detained or murdered for doing their jobs. Worse, this behaviour is normalised by large swathes of society despite a constitutional right to a free press. Close to 200 journalists have been killed in the line of duty since the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr was ousted in 1986 — four of them under the current administration of his son Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio has been detained since 2020 on trumped-up charges of illegal possession of firearms and financing terrorist activities. Toward the end of former president Rodrigo Duterte’s term, the government blocked over two dozen websites, including the publications Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly over alleged links to terrorism. During Duterte’s term from 2016 to 2022, the major broadcaster ABS-CBN was shut down and popular online news site Rappler faced several legal cases, including tax evasion charges and registration cancellation that threatened its business operations. Duterte also banned a Rappler journalist from entering the Malacanan presidential palace. The former president’s penchant for sexist comments and sexual assault encouraged others to behave this way toward female journalists. The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict established in 2018did not spare journalists, media workers and news media organisations from claims that Filipinos in these industries were part of a communist conspiracy, a practice known in the Philippines as ‘red-tagging’. The entire AlterMidya organisation, a network of alternative news media organisations known for grassroots reporting and critical analysis, has been repeatedly red-tagged and many of its members face regular harassment and intimidation. This situation has not changed under Marcos Jr. Journalist Percy Lapid was killed near his house after being accused of being a communist. Dozens of websites remain blocked, and Frenchie Mae Cumpio continues to languish in jail even as the call for her release has gone international. A culture of impunity remains entrenched in the Philippine press as the rich and powerful circumvent the law. Unsolved killings of journalists have resulted in the Philippines being perennially listed in the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Global Impunity Index for 16 consecutive years. Reporters Without Borders puts the Philippines at 134 out of 180 countries in its 2024 World Press Freedom Index and stresses that although the Marcos Jr administration may be ‘amiable’ toward the press, the ongoing media attacks are ‘still worrisome’. For its part, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines has criticised Marcos Jr for his failure to protect and uphold press freedom. While the current administration claims to be transparent, Marcos Jr is largely inaccessible to the media and rarely entertains media queries. His actions suggest he does not place much value in freedom of information, given the lack of access offered to the president. Amnesty International has observed no progress in human rights under the Marcos Jr regime, nor have United Nations human rights officials. Such perceptions in the international sphere further amplify the impunity that affects Philippine society in general and the media in particular. The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said that there is little difference between Duterte and Marcos Jr in regard to human rights violations. Human rights group Karapatan documented 89 victims of extra-judicial killings and 13 cases of enforced disappearances from July 2022 to December 2023, among other empirical data painting a bleak picture. It does not help that Marcos Jr engages in disinformation, particularly historical denialism. He shows no remorse for what happened during his father’s dictatorship or denies the worst of it even existed. While there are news media organisations that are standing up to the current president, the Philippine news media have become mostly docile and compliant. The chilling effect is clear. Members of the media understand that if they push too hard they will wind up abused, imprisoned or even killed. Most in the industry want to avoid being the next victim. Certain media owners are either related to the Marcoses or are capitalists with diverse business interests, preferring to be on the good side of the government. They have for all intents and purposes become enablers of the regime’s media repression campaign. The Philippines must reject the normalisation of media repression. For those still fighting, the goal now is defending the constitutional right to press freedom and ending Marcos Jr’s culture of impunity.

New Strategic Synergy Between Vietnam And Malaysia – Analysis	The official visit by His Excellency To Lam, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to Malaysia creates a new chapter of Hanoi-Kuala Lumpur ties that has been rooted in historical friendship and strategic interdependence. This is Lam's first visit to Malaysia since being elected as head of the Communist Party of Vietnam in August this year, and the significance of the visit is further bolstered considering that the last time Malaysia received a visit from the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam was in March 1994, a year before Vietnam's formal accession to ASEAN. The General Secretary outlined the key pillars of this new partnership, which include strengthening political trust and cooperation, particularly in defence and security, and this heralds a new chapter in strengthening political trust, and deepening synergy and partnership in areas of high politics. As Lam emphasised the need for strategic collaboration in upholding international law and contributing to regional peace, development, and prosperity, this mutual commitment elevates the combined strength and advantage in working closely together in facing common challenges in the future. The elevation to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership underscores the role of various critical sectors that benefit both nations, including green and digital economy, science and technology, new energy transition, high technology advancement,human resources development and people to people relations. Vietnam's support for Malaysia's role and upcoming role as the Asean Chair will see greater cohesion and support for promoting regional peace and stability while upholding the sanctity of international law and the rules-based order. Bilateral ties have been underpinned by the common strength and prospect of economic interdependence, especially on critical resources and technologies. Both are looking to bolster resilience and reliability in supply chain, food security, defence assurances and critical technologies of the future including semiconductor and Artificial Intelligence. It is a testament to the enduring friendship between our nations and reflects the shared commitment we hold in advancing greater partnerships for global prosperity. In the focus on developing human capital and people to people advancement, Lam spoke about the broader regional context, where education and training are essential drivers and foundations that enable ASEAN and its member states to thrive in an unpredictable world. Higher economic and trade ties will bring long lasting returns to both nations, as both face common geopolitical and global economic risks. Vietnam is emerging as one of the fastest growing economic power with the highest prospect in the world, and this will complement Malaysia's existing economic transition efforts. By capitalising on one another's strength and advantage, both will create a solid bedrock of economic and political stability not only for ASEAN but for the greater inter-regional development as emerging middle powers. As both share a similar foreign policy approach of non-alignment, peaceful advocacy for conflict management, and non use of force, both Hanoi and Kuala Lumpur are poised to reap greater regional and global expansion of economic and diplomatic roles and influence. Vietnam is committed to proactive, comprehensive, and extensive international integration, while simultaneously enhancing Vietnam's contributions and responsibilities in world politics, the global economy, and the advancement of human civilization.Both nations prioritize trade, international cooperation, and the advancement of investment and technology. Great Economic and Geopolitical Prospect of Vietnam Vietnam has exponentially expanded its economic credentials and leadership in the region since joining ASEAN, being at the forefront of the regional supply chain. and market and among the biggest upcoming economic players in the worldWith ongoing economic reforms and its advantageous location within the Southeast Asia region along with its advantageous demographic asset in its youthful population, Vietnam is poised for a global economic power. This is complemented by its enabling foreign policy of smart diplomatic outreach and advocacy for peace and stability. Maintaining a balance in diplomacy and forming strategic alliances will help solidify Vietnam's position as a stabilizing force in Southeast Asia and beyond, and as a power balancer in the increasing power rivalry, with a stabilising impact on the region and complement Malaysia's efforts. Vietnam has had growth over the last ten years with an average annual GDP increase of 6 to 7%. In 2023, Vietnam's GDP soared to $411 billion from $280 billion in 2018 – a rise that showcases its economic stability and progress. Vietnam is expected to see its economy grow significantly by 2034 with a GDP exceeding $700 billion and a GDP per capita surpassing $10 000 as it moves towards becoming a middle income nation. By the year 2030, it is estimated that Vietnam will see a rise in its middle class population to around 45 million individuals; this growth is expected to boost spending and increase the demand for premium products and services in the country. Vietnam's digital economy is projected to reach $57 billion by 2025 from $23 billion recorded back in 2022 due to the expansion of e-commerce platforms and IT services, alongside the rise of the fintech industry. Vietnam has also quickly become a major export production hub for global manufacturers like South Korea's LG and Samsung Electronics, suppliers to Apple, Inc. and auto makers like Honda and Toyota. The government of Vietnam has pledged to allocate $117 billion, towards infrastructure initiatives from 2024, to 2030 focusing on advancements and projects, and expanding ports such as Hai Phong and Cai Mep Thie Vai to facilitate commerce. Vietnam is at the forefront of the shift towards renewable energy in Southeast Asia.Renewable energy accounted for 13.7% of Vietnam's electricity generation in 2023. It plans to boost its wind and solar power capacity to 45 gigawatts by 2030. Vietnam's young, tech-savvy population is driving innovation. The country's workforce has a median age of 32.5 years and high literacy rates, fostering innovation in startups and technology. The prospects for the coming decade are solid, driven by strong economic fundamentals, strategic geopolitical positioning, and pragmatic foreign policy. Both countries have similar strategic economic positioning and power roles in uplifting the voice and role of ASEAN and beyond. By capitalizing on Vietnam's strengths and elevating strategic partnerships, Malaysia can serve as a strategic partner in reaping joint benefits to be on track to emerge as a joint economic powerhouse and a stabilizing force in regional and global geopolitics. The visit by Lam will prove to be a historic chapter for both nations in presenting a more united front amidst escalating challenges in the region, and to synergise new areas of critical partnerships in key sectors, especially in defence and security and economic and trade realm, further uplifting the trajectories for high-income nation status for both nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFyldmmbkFqPY	2024-11-24T16:05:08-08:00	
India-China Border Agreement: A Case For Military Buildup – Analy...	By Kartik Bommakanti With India and China reaching a limited agreement on the disengagement from and patrolling of the Depsang Bulge and Demchok areas in eastern Ladakh, there is widespread jubilation in some quarters. The celebration of this breakthrough announced on 21 October 2024, should be tempered by the reality that there is still a significant amount of disengagement, de-escalation, and de-induction of forces to be completed by New Delhi and Beijing. Pending further negotiations, under the latest agreement, the following friction points were left out—Galwan Valley (PP 14), Pangong Tso (North and South Banks), Gogra (PP 17A) and Hotsprings (PP 15). These four areas are currently under buffer zones that prohibit patrolling, meaning the status quo ante, has not been restored completely. Meanwhile, with Depsang and Demchok, India and China have agreed to 'coordinated patrolling,' which one analyst described as an 'innovation.' This is misleading and deceptive because it is not an innovation, but a restriction on patrolling. There are three patrolling restrictions under the latest agreement. Firstly, each patrol team cannot exceed 14 troops. Secondly, the other side must be notified before embarking on a patrol. Thirdly, the number of patrols that Indian and Chinese forces can conduct cannot exceed two or three every month, to all the points they deem part of their territory in Depsang and Demchok. Indeed, though India can patrol areas in Demchok, it is not permitted to patrol Charding La—a key pass. In addition, there is a quid pro quo. Just as India has gained patrolling access to Demchok and Depsang up to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13, which it last secured access to in January 2020, China has gained a reciprocal concession by way of an 'escorted patrol' in the Yangste area of Arunachal Pradesh, as well as another location. These patrolling restrictions did not apply under the terms of the 1993 and 1996 agreements. Further, these 'innovations' are ultimately a concession to the Chinese because most of the territory that the Chinese occupied in April-May 2020 was primarily India-dominated, if not India-controlled, territory. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) maintains that '…verification patrolling has commenced on mutually agreed terms in Demchok and Depsang.' Nevertheless, restrictive conditions have been built into this agreement, in a quest to avoid clashes between Chinese and Indian forces. Only time will tell whether this arrangement will deliver the stabilising impact that the Modi government claims it is intended to achieve. Theoretically, clashes could still occur even under the new patrolling arrangement. Beijing has numerous opportunities to rake up trouble along the entire stretch of the 3,500 kilometres of contested boundary between India and China. India has had to accept these restrictive conditions as the price for resuming a limited patrolling agreement at Demchok and the Depsang Plains. The Chinese have compelled India to accept a shift in the terms of prior patrolling arrangements, and India’s consent implies a tacit acceptance of China’s case that earlier patrolling arrangements—as a result of agreements in 1993, 1996, 2005, and 2012—were unworkable or ineffective. Where does that leave India’s quest to restore the status ante of April 2020? Despite the Modi government’s impressive infrastructure build-up along the Sino-Indian boundary, which was one of the key reasons for the Chinese precipitating the ongoing boundary crisis, has New Delhi conceded to Beijing’s demands that it will limit further infrastructure development, especially the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) road? The government will have to come clean and clarify these matters. To its credit, the Modi government has invested heavily in border infrastructure and introduced vital changes in the military command structure. Under the interim budget in February 2024, the government has allocated more capital to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to beef up infrastructure in critical parts along the Sino-Indian border, such as the Nyoma Airfield in Ladakh, Shinku La Tunnel in Himachal Pradesh, the Nechiphu Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh and several others. Supplementing this infrastructure build-up, visible change is underway in the Indian Army’s conversion of its Headquarters Uttar Bharat (HQ-UB) into a new comprehensively operational Corp. This change is geared toward shifting the focus from the peacetime duties of the HQ-UB, which is now a Corps, to a Line of Actual Control (LaC) in the Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand sectors. These are very indispensable and laudable measures. Although the government is performing commendably on these two metrics, it is insufficient. Although the Modi government’s work on India’s border infrastructure paved the way for India’s military mobilisation against China’s annexation of Indian territory in April-May 2020, it has to do more to accumulate military strength through additional capital expenditure. Since 2017, well before the eruption of the current boundary crisis between India and China, there has not been significant growth in the defence budget, especially in capital acquisitions. Growth has been primarily in revenue expenditure which covers pensions, allowances, salaries and so on. This high growth of revenue spending is also driven by 'One Rank, One Pension' (OROP). Even with the introduction of the Agnipath recruitment scheme, cost savings that are intended to help pay for capital acquisitions in the armed services, will not reap benefits until many years later. Engagement with Beijing without militarily equipping the Indian armed forces with additional capabilities conveys weakness. It will run the risk of inviting more crises and possibly a serious military conflagration with the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

Liberty Squandered: The English Tradition From Magna Carta To Emp...	By Vibhu Vikramaditya The identity of a people often shapes the nature and trajectory of their government. In England, a deep-rooted belief in individual liberty has profoundly influenced the nation’s legal and cultural institutions, shaping English society from the early Middle Ages through the Industrial Revolution. This identity—forged through centuries of struggle and self-definition—established a legacy of individual rights, due process, and a balanced approach to law and order. The Magna Carta of 1215, for instance, set a groundbreaking precedent by binding even the king to the rule of law and affirming that Englishmen were 'free-born.' This commitment was further solidified by the development of English common law, which emphasized justice and protection for all citizens, regardless of rank, including the monarch. In 1707, however, a significant shift occurred with the Act of Union, which joined England and Scotland under a single British identity. This transformation required England’s traditions of liberty and local governance to adapt to a centralized imperial authority, reconfiguring individual freedoms within a larger imperial framework. Although these ideals persisted, they began to reflect the needs of an expanding empire, aligning liberty with broader, centralized control. The legacy of English liberty stands at a precarious threshold. The recent UK government advisory, 'Think before you post,' cloaked in public welfare, quietly undermines the freedoms that once defined English identity. Once a steadfast guardian of individual rights, the government now leans toward surveillance and constraint, drifting alarmingly from its founding principles of liberty and due process. This subtle shift suggests a future where the very freedoms that shaped English society are at risk of being quietly surrendered. Evolving Traditions of English Liberty The Magna Carta was originally a series of rebellious victories that compelled the English monarchy to state rights formally that had previously been assumed. First issued in 1215 by King John under pressure from rebellious barons, the document marked a significant shift by formally acknowledging several protections like the right to fair trial and justice. Although annulled shortly after by Pope Innocent III, it was reissued in 1216, 1217, and 1225 under King Henry III, each version reinforcing the principle that the monarchy was bound by law and individual rights were inviolable. Over time, the Magna Carta became a lasting symbol of accountable governance and the protection of fundamental rights, invoked repeatedly by the English against tyranny. The Levellers adopted and expanded upon the ideas of natural law in England during the Wars of Three Kingdoms (1639 -1653), Lilburne particularly argued that government must be based on a contract with the people, one that exists to protect the 'freeborn rights' of every individual. John Lilburne, a prominent Leveller, asserted that 'every man by nature was born with as much freedom as any other man.' Furthermore, Richard Overton, another key Leveller, linked the concept of freeborn rights to the ancient liberties of England, arguing that these liberties were the birthright of every Englishman and were to be upheld by the rational law of nature. He argued that every person should be judged by the law of nature or rule of reason. He advocated for the inherent rights of self-ownership and freedom from aggression, which he believed belonged to all individuals by their humanity. The Levellers’ manifesto, An Agreement of the People, advocated for constitutional reforms to establish a government that truly represented and protected citizens’ rights, including freedom of religion, the press, and conscience. It called for equality before the law, the rule of law, protection of private property, and a democratically-elected parliament. It inspired the Radical Whigs and, subsequently, the Liberal Party. In the 19th century, the Whigs and the Liberal Party championed these principles, promoting greater suffrage, the removal of trade barriers, and the elimination of price and wage controls to foster economic freedom and market competition. The Levellers’ vision resonated with common law’s principles of due process, reason, and communal judgment. Due process mandated transparency and adherence to procedures, safeguarding against arbitrary rule. Trial by jury empowered peers to judge, highlighting fairness and public accountability. Guided by precedent, common law ensured consistency and restrained the whims of those in power, emphasizing rational adjudication and judicial independence to ground justice in enduring principles over fleeting policies. In the early 17th century, Sir Edward Coke’s interpretation of common law reshaped English legal principles by establishing a framework of liberty that bound even the monarch. His ruling in Dr. Bonham’s Case (1610) argued that 'the common law will control Acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them utterly void' if they contravene basic principles of 'common right and reason.' This marked a foundational assertion that courts could nullify laws infringing on individual rights, prefiguring the principle of judicial review that would later become central to constitutional law. Coke’s landmark work, The Institutes of the Lawes of England, expanded on this philosophy, asserting that 'the king himself ought not to be under man, but under God and the law.' This statement directly opposed the doctrine of the divine right of kings, asserting that the monarch was also bound by common law, a revolutionary stance in his era. Coke’s interpretation insisted that law was supreme over all authority, positioning the judiciary as a crucial check on both royal and parliamentary overreach. Through his legal writings and judgments, Coke codified the view of common law as a protector of inherent rights and a constraint on sovereign power. His ideas set the stage for modern constitutionalism particularly in the United States and the rest of the world, cementing judicial oversight as a safeguard against the erosion of civil liberties by any governing power. From English Liberty to Imperial Subject: The Quiet Conquest of England In his 1899 critique, The Conquest of the United States by Spain, William Graham Sumner warned with biting clarity that while the United States had vanquished Spain militarily, it stood on the precipice of an internal defeat by adopting Spain’s authoritarian practices. Sumner’s words cut to imperialism’s core: in subjugating others, a nation risks eroding its own fundamental values, reshaped by the oppressive systems it enforces abroad. His warning is a clear caution against the lure of empire, where the conqueror risks self-loss in conquest. As England’s empire expanded in the 17th and 18th centuries, local English identity gave way to an imperial British identity, dismantling centuries-old liberties. Acts like the Navigation Acts (1651), Stamp Act (1765), and Declaratory Act (1766) ravaged colonial rights, restricting trade, undermining due process, and asserting Britain’s absolute control. The 1707 Act of Union suppressed Scottish autonomy, centralizing power for imperial cohesion. This legal onslaught sacrificed the 'free-born Englishman' ideal, replacing local justice with exploitation and deepening colonial resentment. The Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 imposed taxes without colonial representation, violating the English constitutional principle that taxation required consent—rooted in the Magna Carta and reaffirmed by the 1689 Bill of Rights. These measures sowed resentment that ultimately led to the loss of the American colonies, as they fought to affirm their natural rights. The establishment of Vice-Admiralty Courts in the colonies marked a stark departure from English legal traditions. These courts, operating without juries and presided over by Crown-appointed judges, denied colonists the right to a fair trial—a bedrock of English justice. The Sugar Act of 1764 further empowered these courts to try smuggling cases that, in England, would have been heard in common law courts with juries. This denial of basic legal protections signaled Britain’s disregard for its own principles in favor of enforcing imperial dominance. The British Empire’s expansion necessitated an increasingly centralized government that directly interfered with local governance, diminishing the English tradition of decentralized authority. The Declaratory Act of 1766, for instance, unequivocally imposed Parliament’s supremacy, stripping colonial assemblies of any legislative power by allowing British lawmakers to legislate for the colonies 'in all cases whatsoever.' This act nullified the longstanding colonial self-governance system, effectively rendering local legislative bodies powerless and consolidating control in London. Moreover, the arbitrary expansion of executive power in both Britain and its colonies severely eroded the rule of law, enabling unchecked governmental authority. The Suspension of Habeas Corpus Act of 1794, enacted in response to perceived revolutionary threats, allowed indefinite detention without trial, a direct violation of the 1679 Habeas Corpus Act that had protected citizens from arbitrary imprisonment. This suspension prioritized state security over individual rights, marking a stark departure from English legal principles. In American colonies, governors wielded vast authority under the King’s commission, bypassing colonial assemblies and enacting laws or raising taxes without local consent, fueling resentment and ultimately rebellion. Such unilateral executive actions highlighted the extent to which the British Empire prioritized imperial control over the adherence to fair governance and legal integrity. In conclusion, while much of the foundational principles of English liberty has been eroded through imperial expansion and centralized authority, there is hope for a revival—a new renaissance of the ideals that once defined the nation. By reawakening the commitment to individual rights, due process, and accountable governance, society can reclaim its identity rooted in freedom and justice.

A Defining Moment In The Ukraine War – OpEd	The Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement on Thursday regarding the two attacks by Western long-range weapons on Russian territory on November 19 and 21 and Moscow’s reactive strike on a facility within Ukraine’s defence industrial complex in the city of Dnepropetrovsk with a hitherto unknown non-nuclear hypersonic ballistic missile named Oreshnik. On Friday, at a meeting in the Kremlin with the military top brass, Putin revisited the topic where he clarified that Oreshnik not really at an 'experimental' stage, as Pentagon had determined, but its serial production has actually commenced. And he added, 'Given the particular strength of this weapon, its power, it will be put into service with the Strategic Missile Forces.' He then went on to reveal, 'It is also important that along with the Oreshnik system, several similar systems are currently being tested in Russia. Based on the test results, these weapons will also go into production. In other words, we have a whole line of medium- and shorter-range systems.' Putin reflected on the geopolitical backdrop: 'The current military and political situation in the world is largely determined by the results of competition in the creation of new technologies, new weapons systems and economic development.' Succinctly put, the escalatory move authorised by the US president Joe Biden has boomeranged. Did Biden bite more than he could chew? This is the first thing. The US apparently decided that Putin’s 'red lines' and Russia’s nuclear deterrence were the stuff of rhetoric. Washington was clueless about the existence of a wonder weapon like the Oreshnik in the Russian armoury that is as demonic frightening as a nuclear missile in its sheer destructive apocalyptic potential but will spare human lives. Putin added calmly that Russia intends to give advance notice to civilians to get out of the way before Oreshnik heads for its designated target to annihilate it. The shock and awe in the western capitals speaks for itself. Biden avoided commenting on the issue when asked by reporters. The Oreshnik is not an upgrade of old Soviet-era systems but 'relies entirely on contemporary cutting-edge innovations,' Putin stressed. Izvestia reported that Oreshnik is a new generation of Russian intermediate-range missiles with a range of 2,500-3,000km and potentially extending to 5,000km, but not intercontinental, equipped with multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles (MIRV) — ie., having separating warheads with individual guidance units. It has a speed between Mach 10 and Mach 11 (exceeding 12,000 kms per hour). The Russian daily Readovka reported that with an estimated 1,500 kgs of combat payload, lifting to a maximum height of 12 km and moving at a speed of Mach 10, the Oreshnik launched from the Russian base at Kaliningrad would strike Warsaw in 1 minute 21 seconds; Berlin, 2 min 35 sec; Paris, 6 min 52 sec; and London, 6 min 56 sec. In his statement on Thursday, Putin said, 'there are no means of countering such weapons today. Missiles attack targets at a speed of Mach 10, which is 2.5 to 3 kilometres per second. Air defence systems currently available in the world and missile defence systems being created by the Americans in Europe cannot intercept such missiles. It is impossible.' Indeed, a terribly beauty is born. For, Oreshnik is not just an effective hypersonic weapon and is neither a strategic weapon nor an intercontinental ballistic missile. But its striking power is such that when used en masse and in combination with other long-range precision systems, its effect and power is on par with strategic weapons. Yet, it is not a weapon of mass destruction — rather, it’s a high-precision weapon. Serial production implies that dozens of Oreshnik are in the process of being deployed, which means that no US / NATO staff group and no Anglo-American target intelligence unit in bunkers in Kiev or Lvov is safe any longer. Oreshnik is also a signal to the incoming US president Donald Trump who is ad nauseam calling for an immediate end-of-war settlement. Oreshnik, ironically, has been developed only as Moscow’s reaction to the hawkish decision by then US president Trump in 2019 to unilaterally withdraw from the 1987 Soviet-American treaty on intermediate range nuclear forces (INF). Hence this also signals that Moscow’s trust in Trump is near zero. To drive home this point, on the very same day Oreshnik emerged out of its silo, Tass carried an unusual interview with a top Russian think tanker affiliated to the foreign ministry and Kremlin — Andrey Sushentsov, program director of the Valdai Discussion Club, dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s MGIMO International Relations Department, and member of the Scientific Council under the Russian Security Council. The following excerpts of the interview, plain-speaking and startling, should scatter the hypothesis that there is something special going on between Trump and Putin: 'Trump is considering ending the Ukrainian crisis, not out of any sympathy for Russia, but because he acknowledges that Ukraine has no realistic chance of winning. His goal is to preserve Ukraine as a tool for US interests, focusing on freezing the conflict rather than resolving it. Consequently, under Trump, the long-term strategy of countering Russia will persist. The US continues to benefit from the Ukrainian crisis, regardless of which administration is in power.' 'The United States has regained its position as the European Union’s top trading partner for the first time in years. It is the Europeans who are bearing the financial burden of prolonging the Ukrainian crisis, while the US has no interest in resolving it. Instead, it is more beneficial for them to freeze the conflict, keeping Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia and as a persistent hotspot in Europe to maintain their confrontational approach.' 'Trump has made numerous statements that differ from the policies of Joe Biden’s administration. However, the US state system is an inertial structure that resists decisions it deems contrary to American interests, so not all of Trump’s ideas will come to fruition.' 'Trump will have a two-year window before the midterm congressional elections, during which he will have a certain freedom to push his policies through the Senate and the House of Representatives. After that, his decisions could face resistance both domestically and from US allies.' Make no mistake, Russia is under no illusions. Putin will not waver from the conditions he outlined in June for resolving the conflict: the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbass and Novorossiya; Kiev’s commitment to abstain from joining NATO; the lifting of all Western sanctions against Russia; and the establishment of a non-aligned, nuclear-free Ukraine. Clearly, this war will continue on its course till it reaches its only logical conclusion, which is Russian victory. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev is spot on when he said in an interview with Al Arabiya yesterday that the use of Oreshnik missile 'changes the course' of the Ukrainian conflict. The Western capitals will have to reconcile with the reality that the scope for escalation of the war is ending. Make no mistake, if another ATAMCS strike inside Russia is attempted, it will have devastating consequences for the West. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic put it nicely: 'If you [NATO] think you can attack everything on Russian territory with Western logistics and weapons without getting a response, and that Putin won’t use whatever weapons he deems necessary, then you either don’t know him or you’re abnormal.'

Cambodia, Laos Sack Foreign Ministers In Preparation For More Com...	By David Hutt On Nov. 19, Sok Chenda Sophea, who was only brought in as Cambodia’s foreign minister last year, was given the heave-ho and replaced by his predecessor, Prak Sokhonn. The previous day, the urbane and much-praised Saleumxay Kommasith was dismissed as the foreign minister of Laos and demoted upstairs to the Prime Minister’s Office. It is unusual for foreign ministers in both countries to be reshuffled. Sok Chenda Sophea was only the third foreign minister since the ruling Cambodian People’s Party cemented its power in 1998; Saleumxay was only the fourth foreign minister since the communist takeover in Laos in 1975. In one interpretation, Saleumxay was merely a casualty of an ongoing carve-up of the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party by the Siphadones and Phomvihanes, the two most important political clans. It is expected that 2025 will be a year of horse trading and in-fighting between grandees ahead of the National Congress in January 2026, when the party’s new five-year leadership is announced. Saleumxay was replaced by Thongsavanh Phomvihane, previously head of the ruling communist party’s foreign policy commission and brother of the National Assembly chair, Saysomphone Phomvihane. Saysomphone stands a good chance of becoming the next party chief, but there are still doubts about whether Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, the scion of the Siphandone clan, will get a second term. Uncertain geopolitics ahead Once considered the party’s 'crown prince,' Sonexay’s reputation has suffered badly because of his handling of Laos’s ongoing economic catastrophe, which shows no signs of improving. Saleumxay was seen by some as a challenger to Sonexay, especially after impressing this year as the minister who guided Laos’s ASEAN chairmanship. Yet, he was not universally popular within the ruling communist party. Many apparatchiks perceived him as an aloof, independent-minded upstart who rose too quickly. Removing Saleumxay increases Sonexay’s chances of keeping his job. Putting a Phomvihane in the foreign ministry also increases that family’s influence, too. Beyond domestic political concerns, the removal of the two foreign ministers comes as their governments prepare for more uncertain times internationally. According to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, Prak’s reappointment will increase the 'government’s capabilities' amid intensifying geopolitical tensions. Prak is an experienced diplomat accustomed to fighting Cambodia’s corner amid new Cold War rivalries, whereas Sok Chenda Sophea was principally an economics-minded functionary – appointed last year because he wasn’t geopolitically-minded. The neophyte Hun Manet administration wanted a foreign minister who would focus entirely on increasing trade and investment, which was Sok Chenda Sophea’s sole remit as the former head of Cambodia’s investment council. Under Sok Chenda, the foreign ministry shifted many of its diplomatic duties, allowing it to concentrate on tapping foreign governments for more money. That left other ruling party grandees like Hun Manet and his father, Hun Sen, still in power in Phnom Penh, to operate their own foreign policy – pursuing controversial issues, like the territorial disputes with neighboring Vietnam and Thailand, that could impair economic relations. Trump tariffs Phnom Penh presumably thinks this dual system is no longer workable. Donald Trump’s return as U.S. president in 2025 means Washington will no longer separate geopolitics from trade, so it makes little sense for Phnom Penh to do so, either. Moreover, it knows it will face a much more hostile relationship with the incoming Trump administration, with its threatened blanket 10-20% tariff on global imports when the U.S. is the largest purchaser of Cambodian goods. Trump also will bring Marco Rubio in as secretary of state. Washington’s leading China hawk is expected to take a much tougher stance on Beijing’s partners in Asia, such as Cambodia, and on mainland Southeast Asia’s vast scam industry that is increasingly victimizing U.S. citizens. Unlike Sok Chenda Sophea, Prak is more of a ruling-party partisan who can push back against U.S. criticism. Presumably, Phnom Penh realizes it’ll soon have to wade into a new fight with Washington, making it even more important to be on the best terms with Beijing. Beijing won’t be displeased by Prak’s return. Attuned to Beijing China is believed to have grown weary with some of the princelings installed in Hu Manet’s cabinet during last year’s vast generational succession process. It has been lobbying for the return of Prak, an old-style politician who understands how Beijing prefers things to be done. In Vientiane, Saleumxay did a good job in recent years of pitching Laos to the rest of the world, including the West, and as the only fluent English speaker in the Politburo was key to securing some important development assistance packages from Japan, the U.S., and European states. Yet Laos’s dire economic situation, particularly its massive debts to China, isn’t improving, and only Beijing has the ability to assist meaningfully. A damning report by the IMF published last week noted that Laos’s economy 'critically relies on the continued extension of debt relief from China.' Vientiane knows it must narrow its foreign relations again to focus squarely on China. Indeed, the communist party is eager to find a more senior role for pro-Beijing figures like Sommath Pholsena, currently a deputy president of the National Assembly and a childhood friend of Xi Jinping, China’s president. He’ll likely be the next National Assembly chair. Thongsavanh Phomvihane, the new foreign minister, started his career at Laos’s embassy in Beijing, has closer ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and is more of a party loyalist than Saleumxay. Like Prak, he’s an older, more traditional and safer pair of hands, someone who understands what Beijing wants and how to provide that.

Global Shifts Suggest Syria’s ‘Waiting Game’ Could Pay Off – Anal...	By Christopher Phillips At the height of Syria’s civil war, Bente Scheller, a political scientist and former German diplomat, published 'The Wisdom of Syria’s Waiting Game.' In it, she argued that Syrian foreign policy under President Bashar Assad and, before that, his father Hafez Assad had long followed a strategy of 'waiting out' international difficulties and crises. Damascus would rarely change the policies that provoked ire from outsiders, but instead waited for former critics to soften their stance.This has been Assad’s approach since the Syria conflict exploded in 2011, refusing demands to loosen his brutal grip on power, confident that, with considerable help from allies Russia and Iran, eventually it will be his enemies that bend. Thirteen years after many in the international community cut ties with Damascus and erected sanctions, the regional climate appears to be shifting, and Assad may believe that Syria’s waiting game is once again paying off.Syria’s international rehabilitation has already begun. Even during the civil war, Damascus was never fully isolated. As well as allies Russia, Iran, and China, significant powers, notably Brazil and India, declined to sever ties. As it became clear Assad would survive, a trickle of Arab states, such as the UAE, Egypt, and Jordan, which had called for his overthrow reestablished ties. In 2023, Saudi Arabia favored Syria’s return to the Arab League after its suspension 12 years earlier.But there is still a long way to go. While back in the Arab League and attending regional events such as the recent Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, Assad is far from fully reintegrated. Jordan, among others, protests the flow of Captagon from Syria, allegedly overseen by the Assad regime, while trade and diplomatic relations with the Arab world remain far below pre-2011 levels. Despite low-level talks with Ankara, detente with Turkiye appears to have stalled over continued Turkish control of northern Syria. Meanwhile, relations with the EU and the US remain severed, with economic sanctions still in place.However, three recent developments could shift the dial. First, the Lebanon war. Almost 500,000 people have sought sanctuary in Syria since October, mostly Syrians who fled war in their own country during the previous decade. This helps Assad paint a more positive international image of his war-torn state — even if many refugees are reportedly trying to move on to either Iraq or rebel-held northern Syria. It also increases Syria’s importance to the international aid community and raises the, albeit remote, possibility that Damascus might be included in Lebanese peace talks.A further benefit is that though the decimation of its ally Hezbollah is a blow, it shifts the balance in the Hezbollah-Syria-Iran relationship more in Assad’s favor. Second, the continued rise of populist right-wing parties in Europe increases the chance that ties with the continent could improve. Populist governments in Hungary and Italy have already pushed for the EU to loosen sanctions in exchange for Assad taking back Syrian refugees, and Rome even reopened its Damascus embassy in September.A key development could be the German elections in February, should this result in a far-right Alternative for Germany triumph. Germany and France have led EU opposition to Assad and pushed against those calling for improving ties. But the AFD met with Syrian officials in 2019, and has previously mooted collaborating with Assad to repatriate many of the Syrians living in Germany. Even if the AFD is frozen out of government by other parties, a strong election performance might persuade Germany’s leaders to alter their uncompromising stance on Assad.Finally, there is the reelection of Donald Trump. On the one hand, there are signs that Trump’s return could benefit Assad. His pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently noted how Trump wants to remove US troops from northeastern Syria. This would likely benefit Assad, who wants to recapture all this region. Kurdish forces, currently administering there under US protection, would probably be forced to reconcile with Assad in the face of the alternative: attack by Turkiye. Such an outcome could also help oil the stalled detente with Ankara. Neutralizing the Kurdish autonomous region might lessen Turkish security concerns or, alternatively, Assad might be more open to a phased Turkish withdrawal from the north, having recently captured the east.It is also possible that Assad’s relative neutrality during the Gaza war — not joining its allies Iran and Hezbollah in fighting Israel — may be rewarded with a less hawkish approach from the Trump administration. Tulsi Gabbard, named as director of national intelligence, visited Syria and met Assad in 2017 while a Congresswoman, and her nomination supports the possibility that the new White House could be less hostile. A softer US view of Russia under Trump might also benefit Assad. While the lifting of US sanctions on Damascus appears unlikely, Assad may hope that a less aggressive White House will enforce them less vigilantly.Yet, Trump showed during his first term how unpredictable he can be, and his approach could easily break the other way. Should Trump ramp up his hostility to Iran, as he did before, Assad is unlikely to cut ties with Tehran, which remains the cornerstone of Syria’s foreign policy. In such circumstances, Syria could once again be in Trump’s crosshairs.However, although the geopolitical wheel appears to be turning, it is far from clear Assad will seize this opportunity. It requires considerable diplomatic skill to utilize these changing circumstances effectively. Although the Syrian leader has followed his father’s 'waiting game' diplomacy, it is yet to be seen if he has inherited Hafez Assad’s ability to navigate a way back into international favor. Despite more advantageous conditions, Syria could yet remain a relative pariah. • Christopher Phillips is professor of international relations at Queen Mary University of London and author of ‘Battleground: Ten Conflicts that Explain the New Middle East.’ X: @cjophillips	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF3HzjBmuI2jm	2024-11-24T15:57:57-08:00	
ZAVNOBiH And The Continuity Of Statehood In Bosnia And Herzegovin...	By Dr Mirko Pejanović Following the loss of its state independence in 1463 during the medieval era, Bosnia and Herzegovina remained a distinct multi-confessional, multicultural, and geographically cohesive entity until the mid-20th century, under the rule of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, and later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This status persisted until the imposition of King Alexander I Karadjordjević's January 6th Dictatorship in 1929 and the subsequent reorganisation of Yugoslavia into nine banovinas. Between 1941 and 1945, during the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina became the primary battleground for National Liberation and the anti-fascist struggle led by partisan forces against the occupying powers on Yugoslav territory. The idea of ZAVNOBiH emerged within the framework of the National Liberation Movement. After the organisational and political arrangements were made, the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) convened on 25 November 1943 in Mrkonjić Grad. During this First Session, 247 delegates from across Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted a historic decision to restore and re-establish the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the will of the councillors of the First Session of ZAVNOBiH, Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised as a federal state unit within the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, enjoying equal status with the other five Yugoslav republics. This decision was confirmed at the Second Session of AVNOJ on 29 November 1943. During the three-year national liberation and anti-fascist struggle, the citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina secured the right to politically shape and organise their homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a fraternal and indivisible state union—a union that enshrines the national equality of Croats, Serbs, and Muslims (Bosniaks). The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a federal state unit within the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was solidified through the decisions made at the Second Session of ZAVNOBiH (Sanski Most 1944.), particularly in terms of establishing state institutions. At this session, the Decision on the Structure and Organisation of National Liberation Committees and the Declaration on Citizens’ Rights were adopted, guaranteeing democratic freedoms for citizens as individuals and equality among the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At its Third Session, held in liberated Sarajevo in 1945, ZAVNOBiH transformed into the Provisional People's Assembly and passed the Law on the Formation of the First People's Government of Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina. The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, grounded in the principles of ZAVNOBiH, was constitutionally defined with the adoption of the First Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Constitutional Assembly of Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1946. Since then, Bosnia and Herzegovina has functioned as a people's state with a republican system of governance. More than four decades of peaceful development For over four decades, Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced peaceful development, characterised by complete unity in managing economic and social growth. Between the early 1960s and the 1990s, the country achieved remarkable progress and renewal in both economic and cultural spheres. Its economy was restructured, transitioning from basic to processing industries, and employment reached one million citizens. The population grew to over four million. All children of primary school age were included in basic education. In addition to the University of Sarajevo, universities were established in Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Mostar. The Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ANUBiH) was also founded. All 109 municipalities were connected to Sarajevo, the capital, by paved roads. In the late 1960s, a historic decision formally recognised the national identity of the Muslim (Bosniak) people. This process of full national emancipation went hand in hand with the strengthening of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s autonomy and statehood within the Yugoslav Federation. The introduction of a multi-party system At the beginning of the 1990s, as the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation entered its final stage, Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the historic challenge of transitioning to political pluralism by introducing a multi-party system and deciding its political future through democratic means. The multi-party Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, elected in the country’s first multi-party elections in 1990, passed a decision in January 1992 to hold a citizens’ referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereign and independent state-legal status. All political parties, both ruling and opposition, supported the referendum, with the exception of Karadžić’s Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). In collaboration with Milošević’s regime, the SDS sought to dismantle and deny Bosnia and Herzegovina’s historically established republican statehood. Through their democratic will, with a 64% voter turnout from all ethnic groups and 99% support for the referendum question, citizens decided that their country, homeland, and state should attain the status of a sovereign and independent nation. In this way, they determined the future of their Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on democratic and anti-fascist principles. Honouring the will of the citizens, the countries of the European Union, the United States, and a vast number of countries across the world granted Bosnia and Herzegovina international recognition in early April 1992. This overwhelming support from the global community culminated on 22 May 1992, when Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted as a full member of the United Nations. With its internationally recognised borders, Bosnia and Herzegovina attained international legal subjectivity in the final decade of the 20th century. Through the citizens’ referendum and the international recognition of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the democratic forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina successfully countered efforts to divide the country and dismantle its republican statehood during this turbulent period. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina was denied the opportunity to peacefully develop its sovereign statehood and independence. This peaceful course was violently disrupted by an aggressive war imposed by Milošević’s regime. By the late 1980s, this regime had seized control of the former Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA), bringing it under its command. Using the military power of the JNA—renamed the Army of the Republic of the Serbian People in May 1992—ethnic cleansing of non-Serb populations was conducted in the territory declared as the Republic of the Serbian People. This campaign culminated in mass atrocities against civilians and the genocide of Bosniaks in Srebrenica. Resistance and defence of the sovereignty and multi-ethnic character of the state Democratic and patriotic forces mobilised to resist and defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and multi-ethnic identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Leading the organisation of this resistance and defence was the multi-ethnic Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The wartime Presidency of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ensured political unity in directing the country’s defence efforts. This unity was defined in the Platform for the Activity of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Conditions of War, which reaffirmed the principles of ZAVNOBiH in light of new historical circumstances. Based on this Platform, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were established, with the defence of the country led by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Diplomatic efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the war were pursued through the state delegation’s engagement with peace plans within the framework of international peace conferences. After the United States assumed leadership in shaping peace initiatives, the Washington Peace Agreement was signed in 1994, followed by the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995. With the Dayton Peace Agreement of November 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina entered a historic era of peacebuilding and the development of state institutions. This process was based on the internationalisation of peacebuilding efforts, with the international community and the European Union authorised to play a role in fostering peace, strengthening the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and integrating it into Euro-Atlantic institutions (the Council of Europe, the European Union, and NATO). It is certain that compliance with the EU acquis during Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership negotiations will further develop solutions for the functioning of state institutions, which remain significantly constrained by the Dayton Constitution. At the start of the 21st century, a historic challenge emerged in the form of accelerating Bosnia and Herzegovina's integration into the European Union. One of the key factors behind this momentum has been the geopolitical changes in Europe and beyond. Since 2022, peace in Europe—and consequently in the Western Balkans—has been jeopardised due to the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, violating its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In response to this threat, the institutions of the European Union decided, at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status for EU membership and to open accession negotiations. For Bosnia and Herzegovina, achieving membership in the European Union means overcoming the challenge of becoming a democratic, lawful, and economically prosperous state within the community of free nations and states in Europe. The majority of citizens strongly support an accelerated path toward EU membership, aspiring to achieve this goal by the end of the third decade of the 21st century. To realise this objective, comprehensive measures are required to ensure the effective functioning of the parliamentary majority at the state level. In this context, it is crucial to develop a unified reform agenda and establish full coordination between the activities of the international community and EU institutions on one side, and governing parties and civil society organisations on the other. Reinforcing political pluralism on civic principles It is essential to halt the destructive impact of ethno-nationalist policies and strengthen political pluralism based on civic foundations. One of the key levers for accelerating Bosnia and Herzegovina’s integration into the European Union is the inclusion of a European clause in the country’s Constitution. This provision would facilitate the swift adoption of legislation enabling the transposition of the Acquis Communautaire by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this context, intensifying the activities of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) would be crucial. Leveraging its Bonn powers, the OHR should impose sanctions and exert various forms of pressure to eliminate individuals and entities that promote institutional blockades, deny Bosnia and Herzegovina’s statehood, undermine the Dayton Peace Agreement, or endanger peace in the public political arena. The rising threat of nationalism advocating the secession of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina poses a serious risk to the country’s peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Preventing the evident dangers of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s disintegration will require the international community and the country’s democratic, multi-ethnic forces to accelerate its integration into the European Union. In addition to the threat of secession, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also grappling with the danger of demographic depletion caused by the large-scale emigration of its working-age population to European Union countries.

Sudan’s War Threatens To Create Widespread Ethnic Conflict – Anal...	Sudan’s war is inflaming ethnic tensions across the country and threatening to turn the battle between two military factions into a broader war along tribal lines. 'The escalation of war narratives by both sides is fueling ethnically charged rhetoric,' the Advocacy Group for Peace in Sudan (AGPS) said in a statement. The group said that inflammatory claims by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have spurred dangerous regional and ethnic mobilization. The AGPS compared Sudan’s rising ethnic animosity to the early stages of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. 'Sudan stands on the brink,' the group wrote, urging leaders on both sides to moderate their rhetoric and seek a peaceful solution to the conflict that has killed more than 62,000 and displaced millions since April 2023. Observers say attacks by the RSF on civilians in the al-Gezira and Darfur regions, among others, are driving the rise of ethnic militias as a form of communal self-defense. 'There is no safe place in Sudan now,' Mohamed Chande Othman, head of a recent United Nations fact-finding mission, said in a statement. In al-Gezira, the RSF launched a series of ethnically motivated attacks after one of its local leaders, Abu Agla Keikil, defected to the SAF. The attacks killed 124 civilians and led to more than 37 sexual assaults, according to journalist Martin Plaut, who writes about insecurity in the Horn of Africa. Plaut reported that five RSF advisors defected at the end of October. In Darfur, RSF assaults on non-Arab tribal groups, such as the Masalit, have mirrored the genocidal attacks on the population that the RSF’s predecessor, the Janjaweed, launched in Darfur 20 years ago. The RSF draws from Darfur’s ethnically Arab Rizeigat community. Sudan’s ethnically motivated attacks in West Darfur have included abductions of young and old women by RSF fighters for sexual slavery. Victims have reported their attackers telling them: 'We will make you, the Masalit girls, give birth to Arab children.' Ethnic attacks in Darfur prompted two local militias, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement, to align themselves with the SAF against the RSF in April. Both groups are based in the non-Arab Fur, Zaghawa and Masalit communities. A day later, RSF fighters burned down several non-Arab villages in North Darfur. With 19 major ethnic groups and nearly 600 sub-groups among its 49 million citizens, Sudan risks devolving further into intertribal conflict as the war between the SAF and RSF continues, according to observers. If that happens, Sudan’s conflict could engulf neighboring Chad, which shares tribal ties along its border with Darfur. The Zaghawa tribe, for example, spans the Chad-Sudan border. So does the Rizeigat group that makes up much of the RSF. A tribal conflict in North Darfur could draw in fighters from Chad, according to Remadji Hoinathy, an expert with South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies. 'Zaghawa people from remote villages in Chad — who live along the border and are very armed — could absolutely be implicated in the conflict [in North Darfur],' Hoinathy told Al Jazeera. To reduce the threat of widespread tribal conflict, Sudan’s leadership must address Sudan’s historic ethnic and wealth disparities to build a common vision of the future, according to Hamdy A. Hassan. 'Achieving peace in Sudan requires a focus on the concerns of marginalized populations in conflict zones and deprived regions,' Hassan, a professor at Zayed University in the United Arab Emirates, wrote in The Conversation. 'It also requires addressing the root causes of armed violence.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF7-Nmm3a1kIP	2024-11-24T15:54:42-08:00	
India’s Caste Census Will Act As A hindrance To National Unity An...	The caste system, deeply rooted in India's socio-cultural fabric, has historically influenced various aspects of life, including social status, economic opportunities, and access to resources. The idea of conducting a caste census in India has sparked considerable debate, especially regarding its impact on meritocracy and its potential as a tool for equitable development. Even after 75 years of independence, India continues to wrestle with the complexities of the caste system, a challenge further compounded by vote-bank politics. The debate over conducting a caste census has intensified, raising significant concerns about its potential impact on meritocracy and the country's socio-economic development. Although, the intention behind the census is to address historical inequities, such measures risk exacerbating societal divisions. Recently, several states have conducted caste-based censuses to create a development model that addresses economic disparities and provides equal opportunities for marginalised communities. The goal is to identify these groups and direct resources toward their upliftment. While such initiatives seek to rectify social inequality and the unequal distribution of resources in India, they also present certain challenges. A caste census would generate detailed data on the socio-economic conditions of various caste groups, which could inform targeted policies to reduce disparities. However, while increasing reservations is designed to address economic gaps and offer equal opportunities to historically marginalised communities, it could undermine meritocracy in India. Marginalised communities often suffer from poor socio-economic conditions, which limit their access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential resources, putting them at a disadvantage despite their potential. The caste system, deeply embedded in India's socio-cultural fabric, continues to influence social status, economic opportunities, and access to resources. The impact of reservation policies on merit has already been evident, particularly in government services, universities, and academic institutions. One prominent example is the way candidates are elected based on caste, especially in the Hindi heartland. In India, it is often challenging for an intellectual, no matter how capable, to win elections on merit alone. One of the major drawbacks of increasing reservations based on caste is that the caste census could further undermine the principle of meritocracy by placing too much emphasis on caste-based benefits. However, a broader view of meritocracy reveals that it is not just about academic qualifications; it's about creating a level playing field. A caste census could help identify and nurture untapped talent by providing opportunities and resources to historically deprived communities. A More Inclusive Model Critics argue that caste-based reservations risk prioritizing benefits based on identity over ability, potentially undermining meritocracy. However, creating a truly meritocratic society requires equal opportunities for all, regardless of caste or background. The government could consider an alternative model where reservations are based on income rather than caste. This approach would provide benefits to economically disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their caste, ensuring that those with merit from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), or any other economically disadvantaged group could benefit equally. The caste system has polarized Indian society, creating divisions that weaken the social fabric. A more inclusive approach—one that considers both socioeconomic disadvantages and individual merit—could foster a more just and equitable society. True meritocracy is not just about academic scores and qualifications; it's about allowing everyone to realize their potential. Currently, India's reliance on quotas has often compromised merit. Decisions based on caste alone only deepen this divide, further eroding meritocracy by limiting opportunities for those with potential. The Way Forward If India is to achieve its development goals, it must reassess its reservation policies and embrace reforms that prioritize both equity and merit. Shifting the focus to socioeconomic status, rather than caste identity, could pave the way for a more united, just, and progressive nation. The caste census is socially divisive, and it is time for politicians to rise above caste-based politics and focus on the well-being of economically disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their caste. Unfortunately, many leaders lack the political will to move away from the caste-based quota system, which has worked in their favour. However, if India is to emerge as a global power committed to justice and equity, leaders must support a model that promotes reservations based on economic need. This would ensure that even those who do not belong to reserved categories but come from poor backgrounds are not excluded from the benefits of development.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFxtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-24T15:52:55-08:00	
To Understand Trump, Take Him Seriously, But Not Literally – OpEd	By Josep M. Colomer To try to foresee the next four years with US President-Elect Donald Trump, we should remember what we learned during his first presidential term: It is a mistake to take him literally and mock him because he is not serious in his bravado. Better the other way: Take him seriously, but not literally. Trump’s advantage is that he is not guided by rigid ideological principles, in contrast to the bellicosity of both the 'neocons' and the 'woke,' but is open to pragmatic transactions — always, of course, if they satisfy his vanity or his business. Another advantage of his, paradoxically, is that there will be open results due to his incompetence and disorder. Let us review the agenda. The number one problem in the world today, and Trump’s greatest threat, is the climate crisis, which is accelerating its destructive consequences. Trump will undoubtedly promote fossil production, but the Environmental Protection Agency will maintain the protective and preventive regulations established over the past few years, 12 states will continue to apply restrictions on emissions, and large cities will continue to spread renewable energy. Regarding immigration, this time Trump did not insist on the wall (most of which he failed to build while he was last in the White House). In this campaign, he turned to 'mass deportations,' which can mean common-sense controls to cross the border, as already agreed with the Mexican government regarding non-Mexicans, or an illusory hunt for individuals without proper documents in neighborhoods, workplaces and family homes, which would not only be savage but logistically unfeasible. In reality, it is to be hoped that Congress will reactivate the bipartisan agreement for immigrants’ legalization and access to citizenship that Trump ordered to be stopped not because of its content but because it would have been approved during the campaign and would have taken away his favorite topic for demagoguery. As for Israel and Palestine, the biggest problem is that Trump is now prioritizing enmity with Iran, which finances and pushes Hamas and Hezbollah and whose agents tried to assassinate him twice (or perhaps thrice). He will have a hard time resurrecting the Abraham Accords that his Jewish son-in-law negotiated during his first term: exploring again the two-state solution in exchange for diplomatic recognition of Israel by Arab countries. Now, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will only accept it if Trump diminishes his hostility against Iran, where a 'reformist' candidate won the presidential election and seems to have appeased the fury. Regarding Ukraine, Trump boasted that he would 'fix it in 24 hours,' but was not very specific. Two days after the election, at the Valdai Forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin rushed to offer a peace agreement based on the 'self-determination' of the people of Donbas in exchange for respecting Ukraine’s borders. Putin also hinted that Russia could restore natural gas supplies through the Baltic to Germany, which Ukrainian agents destroyed. A Trump adviser has outlined a plan to defend Ukraine’s neutrality outside NATO for the next twenty years. All this sounds similar to the Minsk Agreements reached a few years ago by Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, which US President Barack Obama ignored. In the face of Trump’s disdain, the European Union may reinforce internal solidity and external autonomy. Many NATO members are already ceasing to be free-riders on the United States and are fulfilling their commitment to invest at least 2% of GDP in defense. Their number has risen from four to 23 in just six years. The biggest alarm raised by Trump’s election is that the future of democracy and legal security in the United States may be in jeopardy. Will there be 'revenge' against 'internal enemies,' and will he go after politicians, judges, generals, officials, journalists and other opponents? He may not need to once the pending court cases are canceled and he has satisfied his obsession with returning to power. The Senate Republican group has already rejected Trump’s nominee to lead it, and the Senate can veto some of his announced appointees. It is worth remembering that in his first term, Trump appointed three Chiefs of Staff in four years and changed most members of the Cabinet, including State, Defense, Justice, Interior and Homeland Security, a tenor of personal instability that is likely to continue. Some of Trump’s boasts may end in a major ridicule, such as ordering Elon Musk to cut a third of the budget. Incompetence could also sink him in the face of some unforeseen catastrophe, as happened to during US President George Bush’s second term with Hurricane Katrina and to himself with the COVID-19 pandemic. Will Trump be able to maintain a regular daily work schedule in his eighties, or will he, like Joe Biden, be busy only from 10 AM to 4 PM? It is not guaranteed that he will complete four years in good shape. Ultimately, Trump could also become a chaotic parody of the befuddled White House visitor in the film Being There (1979). As Mister Chance says, 'I can’t write. I can’t read. But I like to watch television.' Just like Donald the Returned.

Pam Bondi – Everything You Need To Know About Trump’s New AG Pick...	By James Fite Just hours after former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) bowed out as the US attorney general nominee, President-elect Donald Trump announced a replacement: Pam Bondi. As another longtime staunch Trump ally, Bondi may be everything the incoming president wants in an AG without all the scandal Gaetz brought to the table. The right loves her, and the left fears her, but who is this woman who may soon be in charge of the Department of Justice? Here’s everything you need to know about Pam Bondi but were afraid to ask. An Impressive Résumé The best place to start is where she has been and what she has accomplished – and that’s quite an impressive list. After more than 18 years as a Florida prosecutor, Pam Bondi burst onto the political scene in 2010 after she was elected to be the Sunshine State’s first female attorney general, a job she held until 2019. If confirmed, she’ll be just the third woman to serve as US attorney general. In her time as Florida’s AG, Bondi worked to end the opioid epidemic and shut down pill mills. Her approach resulted in a 52% decline in oxycodone deaths and an overall decline of 23% in prescription drug overdose deaths in Florida between 2011 and 2014, then-CDC Director Tom Frieden explained at the 2016 National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. An 'unprecedented national achievement,' he called it. She also tackled human trafficking and pushed the state’s crime lab to clear the backlog of more than 13,000 unprocessed sexual assault kits. Bondi overhauled the state’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and obtained more than $870 million in settlements and judgments. She also fought for consumer rights. In her tenure, she helped recover more than $1 billion in consumer protection, antitrust, and false claims settlements. She has since made a name for herself as a Trump ally. She served on his defense team during the first impeachment trial and co-chaired his 2020 re-election campaign. Bondi also served as chair for the Center of Litigation and co-chair of the Center of Law and Justice for the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank established in 2021 by former Trump advisers. Pam Bondi – The Left’s New Boogeyman? Even CNN Legal Analyst Elie Honig had to admit that 'Pam Bondi is, without a question, qualified to be Attorney General.' He went on to explain that Bondi’s level of experience is 'on par with, or better than most United States Attorneys General that we’ve seen over the past 50 years or so.' As impressive as her résumé is, however, you won’t read about it in the 'what to know about Pam Bondi' articles published by most left-leaning news outlets. About halfway down the AP’s piece, for example, Bondi’s work gets a one-line mention: 'As Florida’s top prosecutor, Bondi stressed human trafficking issues and urged tightening state laws against traffickers.' That, plus the fact she was the state’s first female attorney general, is about all the credit she gets. The AP and the many establishment news outlets that seem to practically copy and paste from it focus instead on Bondi’s loyalty to Trump, her work as a lobbyist, and 'a few of her own political issues.' Bondi issued an apology in 2013 after she looked to delay the execution of a convicted killer 'because it conflicted with a fundraiser for her reelection campaign.' She also received a $25,000 campaign contribution in 2013 from Donald Trump, around the same time her office declined to participate in New York’s lawsuit over fraud allegations involving Trump University. To quote Fox News’ Jesse Watters, 'you know Bondi’s a winner because the deep state sounds awfully nervous.' Indeed, the AP does come out and say that, if confirmed, 'Bondi would instantly become one of the most closely watched members of Trump’s Cabinet given the Republican’s threat to pursue retribution against perceived adversaries and concern among Democrats that he will look to bend the Justice Department to his will.' A bit farther down, the outlet claims Trump 'sought to use the powers of the Justice Department to advance his own interests,' and that Bondi 'appears likely to oblige him.' College professor and MSNBC contributor Jason Johnson revealed the real reason the left fears her. In a talk with MSNBC host Ari Melber, Johnson explained: 'Pam Bondi is exactly what I was saying in the last segment that we should all fear, because she’s competent. We may not agree with her ideologically, but she actually knows how to do this job.' He continued: 'So if anyone on the Democratic side or anyone who cared about liberty or justice was thinking ‘Well maybe Matt Gaetz will screw this up and that will give us time,’ no. Pam Bondi knows what she is doing.' Regardless of where one falls on the ideological spectrum, the thoroughly freaked-out progressive left is right about a few things: Pam Bondi is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump. She’s also far more likely to see a successful confirmation than the scandal-mired Matt Gaetz. And she does, in fact, know what she’s doing.

ECOWAS Collapses Abidjan-Lagos Highway – OpEd	Never underestimate the power of Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), also known as CEDEAO in French and Portuguese, created on 28th May 1975 as a regional political and economic union bringing together fifteen (15) countries of West Africa. Per the date of its established, this so-called regional bloc marks its 50th year in 2025, a significant historical celebration. Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African Economic Community (AEC), ECOWAS generally has its primary common goal of working consistently towards achieving, what is first referred to, as 'collective self-sufficiency' for its member states by creating a single large trade bloc by building a full economic and trading union. Additionally, ECOWAS aims to raise living standards of an estimated population of over 425 million people and to promote economic development based on the principles of inter-dependence, solidarity, and cooperation. Until writing this article, ECOWAS has frequently been discussing and reviewing the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Development Project, one single regional infrastructure project these several years. It has shown its total commitment looking for funding while billions have been siphoned by leaders into foreign banks. African leaders are quick negotiating and paying for foreign military weapons but grossly unsuccessful in soliciting similar assistance from these external partners to invest in infrastructure development such as the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Development Project. West African Highway Launched in 2017 The construction of this proposed grandiose West African highway has its own chequered history. The proposed project was successfully launched in 2017, and since then it has had series of high-powered meetings and conferences, technical studies has been conducted, and financing the construction and to its feasibility and practical operationalization. The Abidjan-Lagos highway, the six-lane dual carriage highway, is estimated at $15.1 billion. On resource mobilization, it was explicitly noted that ECOWAS had adopted a new regulatory framework on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) – an incentive for the entry of private sector in large investments like the nature of this project. The African Development Bank (AfDB) on behalf of the development partners offered its assurance for unwavering commitment to the realization of the highway. Akinwunmi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) has several times highlighted the importance of the Abidjan-Lagos highway as an infrastructure project in West Africa that would ease free movement of people, goods and services, generate social and economic activities, and ultimately promote cross-border trade within the region, its economic viability and enormous potentials especially now that African Union looks to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Noticeably, Africa has long been considered as a frontier for manufacturing, for technology, for food production. Africa is getting ready for business, it is busily building the world's largest single market of 1.4 billion people. Special Meetings and Technical Consultations Several meetings upon meetings, and upon meetings have been held since the project was proposed in 2017. Since 2017, paid meetings were held, experts were paid. The latest of such paid meeting was held in November 10-11, 2024. This roundtable was initiated following the instructions given to the ECOWAS Commission. Late September 2024, such roundtable meeting was held in Abidjan, capital city of Côte d'Ivoire, under the auspices of the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID). The highway corridor is calculated to be approximately 1,080 km long. It will connect some of the largest and most economically dynamic cities Abidjan, Accra, Cotonou, Lomé and Lagos, while covering a large proportion of West Africa's population. It will also link very vibrant seaports in West Africa. In addition, it will serve all the landlocked ECOWAS member-states, for example Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the region. Nearly 40 million people are estimated to be living along the Abidjan-Lagos corridor while 47 million people travel along the axis every year. These are expected to be direct beneficiaries of the development of the project touted to be a real backbone of trade in the region. According official documents, this highway project falls in line with the key objectives of the ECOWAS Vision 2050, including (i) facilitating the movement of people and goods, and (ii) accelerating trade and transport, regional and international, improving road infrastructure. It is eventually expected that the transport corridor will be transformed into a development corridor to stimulate investment, sustainable development and poverty reduction within the entire region. West African Highway and AfCFTA The focal point of controversy and debate, these several years, are centered on mechanism of financing, the state-of-the-art management of this new mega-highway - from planning through practical construction to its final commissioning, ready for cutting-edge usage by the transport industry. The idea of prioritizing highway innovation, signalling a bold leap in West Africa's transportation infrastructure, is its recognizable potential transformative impact. Simply intended to improve and facilitate movement of services, goods and people across the region. The Abidjan-Lagos Highway highlights its potential to enhance regional connectivity and drive economic growth, especially with the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade (AfCFTA), the ambitious flagship of the African Union (AU). According to ECOWAS latest document issued after their two-day special meeting held on November 11 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 'experts have lauded findings of the study which has among others, unveiled a potential $6.8 billion investment prepared and ready to be implemented to unlock economic growth and enhance the viability of the proposed highway.' The overall objective is to identify and unlock the inherent and latent economic potential (short, medium and long-term) and commercial viability of economic and industrial value chain projects. These economic projects, once implemented, will also generate trade volumes and traffic to augment the viability of the highway. The final draft reports were issued after groups revisited (that was not the first time) several tolled bridges and roads in Abidjan for knowledge and experience sharing strategy envisaged for the Abidjan-Lagos Highway. At the end of the exercise, the study report (re)validated commitment to unlock the inherent and latent economic potential of the highway construction and estimated at $6.8 billion in potential investment in the region. Final Construction Still Out of Sight For the past few years, significant attention have been drawn by widely publicized announcement of securing enough funds from African banks and from external sources for the construction this regional highway which could become a cornerstone, and the public narrative of achievement by ECOWAS, which marks its 50th year in 2025. However, transport industry analysts, researchers and experts have already cast serious doubts and skyline skepticism if ECOWAS could live to this onerous task. Grandiose ceremony-infested ECOWAS future task of achieving its primary target of constructing 'speed-highway' remains an eternal dream. Noticeably, ECOWAS has little to celebrate, except its existence by name, (the golden jubilee) at its 50th year in May 2025. At least, Africans will rather jubilate over the authenticity of reforming and transforming the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF-Fb4avN7oh8	2024-11-24T15:46:32-08:00	
Pro-West PM Leads Romanian Presidential Vote, Russia-Friendly Can...	(RFE/RL) -- Partial preliminary results in Romania's presidential vote give Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu a narrow lead, but a surprisingly strong showing by pro-Russia candidate Cailin Georgescu has thrown the race into unexpected territory. With 80 percent of polling stations reporting on November 24, the pro-Western Social Democrat Ciolacu had 22.17 percent of the vote, according to election officials. But his opponent in an expected runoff round remains unclear after Georgescu – who has been criticized for his anti-NATO sentiments – was in second place with 22.11 percent. Pro-West Elena Lasconi of the center-right Save Romania Union was third with 14.97 percent, while George Simion of ultranationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR) had 14.94 percent. Experts said that results from the large cities – where Ciolacu and Lasconi are likely to poll stronger than Georgescu – could still decide the tight race. Two exit polls gave Ciolacu 25 percent of the vote, while Lasconi was second at around 18 percent. Georgescu and Simion trailed in the exit polls with 14-16 percent in the cluttered field of 13 candidates. The exit polls did not include diaspora polling, where Lasconi and Simion were expected to lead the balloting. Some observers said that even with Ciolacu's slim lead, the far right appeared to be the big winner in the vote. If no candidate receives over 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held on December 8 featuring the two top finishers, a week after a parliamentary election on December 1. Ciolacu was the favorite heading into the election and pre-vote surveys indicated five candidates had a shot at advancing to the runoff to succeed the outgoing center-right incumbent, Klaus Iohannis, who is completing his second and final term after a decade in office. Fourteen candidates officially registered in the race, but Ludovic Orban announced he was withdrawing from the contest. Election officials put the turnout at just over 50 percent, or about 9.44 million voters casting their ballots. Long lines were reported at polling stations in the capital, Bucharest, ahead of the 9 p.m. poll closings. In 2019, total first-round turnout was 51.18 percent. In the second round, it rose to 55.1 percent. At three polling stations, turnout was reported at 150-300 percent. Officials said the high figure was due to supplemental lists holding more names than the permanent lists and by people voting in precincts they were not originally assigned. Georgescu, 62, who has been criticized in the Romanian media for expressing pro-Russia sentiments, claimed his shocking vote total represents a real victory for Romania. 'The rich of the system have become poorer, and the poor Romanians have become richer. It's an astonishing awakening in consciousness,' said the candidate, who utilized the TikTok social media platform to press his campaign. Following release of the exit polls, Lasconi told reporters that the results remain tight and that she will wait until official results are clear before 'rejoicing' over her potential placement in the runoff. Lasconi, a former small-town mayor and journalist, was the only presidential candidate who opposed the idea of Ukraine giving up land to Russia in a peace deal, saying doing so would embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'If Ukraine cedes territory, Putin won't stop,' she had said. 'We need to help Ukraine win this war.' She was also the most bullish among the top candidates on NATO, calling for the military alliance to have a greater presence in Romania. Ciolacu expressed pro-Europe sentiment leading up to the election. 'We will support the deepening of the European integration project for the benefit of citizens, and we will have a more active voice in the decision-making process at the European level,' he has said. Critics have charged Simion with being too Russia-friendly and, while he wants Romania to remain in NATO, said Bucharest should be 'neutral.' Despite the exit polls, Simion expressed confidence in reaching the second round. 'We were alone against the parties of the system, and we will enter the second round,' said Simion, who urged his supports to 'turn off the TVs' and ignore reports stating that a 'stranger,' Georgescu -- who had received little attention ahead of the vote -- was ahead of him in the exit polls. Romania has become a key ally of Ukraine, not only providing training and military equipment but playing a key role in transporting Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods to global markets. Much of the credit for Bucharest's pro-Ukraine stance goes to the incumbent, Iohannis. Rima, a voter at a Bucharest polling station, told RFE/RL, 'There should be more opportunities for young people, so we don't have to leave the country after we graduate from high school or college.' 'The president should be more open-minded on some topics, especially international ones. That's what I want: to live in a free country where we as young people have a voice,' she said, without specifying her candidate. Romania's president has significant decision-making powers, including on matters of national security and foreign policy. Elected for a five-year term, the president can also reject party nominees for prime minister and government nominees for judicial appointments. Diaspora voting began on November 23, with initial figures indicating a higher turnout than in 2019 among those abroad, with about 675,000 of such votes cast by 6 p.m. on November 24, up about 90,000 from the 2019 election. In Moldova, more than 80,942 voted at 59 polling stations, with officials calling it a record high. In the first round of the 2019 Romanian presidential election, 43,307 people voted in Moldova. Most of Moldova was part of Romania until the end of World War II and many Moldovans also hold Romanian citizenship. Voting was also reported to be high in London, where almost 8,900 Romanians went to the polls. Oana Popescu-Zamfir, director of the Bucharest-based think tank GlobalFocus Center, told RFE/RL in an email that this is a high-stakes election for the NATO and EU nation. 'Romania is faced with two important realities next year: the threat of further instability and conflict in the region and globally, especially in the context of a [President-elect Donald] Trump White House,' she said, along with the risks of a 'deepening economic and financial crisis.' Foreign policy is also of concern to voters, namely Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and how that conflict could change with a switch in Washington from U.S. President Joe Biden, who has steadily backed Kyiv, to Trump, who has suggested support could be curtailed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF5fa9AtxhdHe	2024-11-24T15:44:56-08:00	
Ralph Nader: From Mount Trump – How Trump Sees His World – OpEd	Let’s look at the political scene from Trump’s viewpoint. Sitting in his luxurious Mar-a-Lago palace receiving the daily obeisant supplicants eager to heed his every word and praise exuberantly his megalomania, Donald J. Trump can hardly believe his good fortune. Starting in the 2015 presidential race against 16 GOP primary opponents, Trump’s vituperative attacks were unleashed. Never in American history have words from a politician’s mouth ever metastasized into such unchallenged electoral victory and domination. His daily, hourly bullying verbal abuses flooded THE MASS MEDIA, which faithfully transmitted to tens of millions of people like clockwork – lying or false statements and tweets in the tens of thousands. Looking over his gigantic domain astride the country and soon the world, Trump can recount the pillars of his elected dictatorship. The Supreme Court in their impeachable June 2024 unconstitutional decision (Trump v. United States) has decreed that the President’s 'official conduct' (undefined) is immune from criminal prosecution for whatever they do. This 6 to 3 decision already fortifies Trump’s previous determination notoriously declared in July 2019 when he exclaimed 'Then, I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.' And he did just that, violating with impunity federal criminal statutes (See the December 18, 2019, Congressional Record, H-12197), violating the Constitution, defying over 125 Congressional subpoenas, and according to John Bolton his National Security Advisor, making 'obstruction of justice a daily practice in the White House.' Second, Trump has control of Congress with the Republican GOP majority in the House and Senate, however narrow. Congress is thus far showing no sign of resisting his demands for utter submission. House Speaker Mike Johnson has already signaled this abdication of his constitutional duty for checks and balances. Senate Majority Leader Senator John Thune is more circumspect. However mindful he is of the Senate’s constitutional duty of 'advice and consent' regarding Trump’s nominees, Thune has to worry about being overthrown and replaced at any time as Senate Majority Leader by hovering Trump loyalists. Trump wants the Senate to declare a recess for more than ten days to get his team of cabinet and agency nominees appointed without the usual confirmation hearings. This is an extreme demand. As constitutional law specialist, Bruce Fein asserts: 'Such contrived recesses serve no legitimate constitutional purpose. That would make such official acts voidable,' i.e., unenforceable. This illegal escape hatch for Trump is unlikely to materialize for some of his nominees whom the Senate majority will want to reject. Why? Because, for example, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services will be vigorously opposed by Big Pharma, the Big Food Processors, the Health Insurance giants, and the Big Global Warming Polluters (fossil fuels) industries whom he has long criticized and sued when he was an effective environmental lawyer. He doesn’t have much support from Democratic Senators due to his statements about vaccines and their side effects. Guessing, I expect the Senate will turn him down following a conventional nomination hearing. The military-industrial giants will oppose Tulsi Gabbard as Trump’s Director of National Intelligence. She is seen as too extreme a critic, too inexperienced, and likely not to 'get along by going along' with the entrenched national intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA. Trump’s choice for Secretary of Defense, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, a veteran, with no managerial experience, has made harsh statements about military leadership, women, and Muslims. He evinces wanting to go on a vengeance kick and not on a mission to do what Trump has campaigned for, which is ending 'endless wars.' The 47 Democratic Senators are likely to be joined by enough Republican Senators to block his nomination. Trump’s choice of Chris Wright, head of a fracking company and a climate-denier, as Secretary of Energy, will get the full backing of the oil, gas and coal industries leading to an affirmative vote in the Senate. None of these problems bother Trump. Just as was the case with former Representative Matt Gaetz who was forced by disclosures, regarding his sexual aggressions and other negatives, to take himself out of the running nomination for Attorney General, Trump will find plenty of replacements willing to run a Justice Department which lets him do whatever he wants with impunity. At the end of the day, what matters to Trump is getting what he wants. He is warranted in such confidence. Who is going to challenge him? He believes correctly that it will not be the Supreme Court or Congress. The state legislatures will be on the defensive due to his willingness to cut grants and federal contracts to the states, including critical Medicaid services for millions of needy Americans, along with other traditional social safety net programs. The labor unions, worrying about a third of their membership being Trumpsters, among other inhibitions (See, Election Day Delirium by Chris Townsend), are not much of a factor, as they have tethered themselves (with few exceptions) to the Democratic Party bureaucracy. The citizen groups will file their lawsuits and wait for the expected court delays that spell 'Justice delayed is justice denied.' As for the mainstream media CEOs, Trump knows they want higher ratings and more readers so he has given them daily fodder for outrageous epithets, falsehoods, braggadocios and empty promises. In return, media outlets have faithfully published his crazed bloviations. The media has also reported his many corruptions, lies, ignorance of facts, bigotry, sexual escapades, and indictments – to no avail. The MAGA crowd just gets bigger. All the exposés, helped by blunders of prosecutors and partisan Trump judges, have fallen off Teflon Trump like water off a duck’s back. He has procrastinated releasing his full medical history, contrary to his promises in 2016, 2020 and 2024. He has also resisted releasing his tax returns. He now has not complied with ethical reports during the transition from Biden’s regime to his regime. Der Fuhrer Trump believes the rules that his presidential peers have followed do not apply to him. There is a little light at the end of the tunnel. Democratic State Attorneys General will sue and block some of Trump’s violative decisions. Some state prosecutors will go after the burgeoning corruption of Trump’s nominees and their corporate collaborators eager to raid the honey pots of Uncle Sam. But the biggest risk to Trump’s domination will be Trump himself and what damage he will be unleashing that workers, consumers and communities, even those who voted for him, will feel intensely. The assault on their health, safety and economic well-being may weaken Trump’s support. Once people start thinking that MAGA is really MABA (Make America Betrayed Again), the polls should start sliding propitiously from the sky-high expectations of the Paradise that Trump promised every campaign day. At his core, Trump is not all that much different than his worst predecessors. He continued several Bush/Obama wars overseas in his first term, intensifying his backing of war criminal Bibi Netanyahu. He later swallowed his campaign criticism of price-gouging drug companies. And of course, he loves Wall Street, Houston, (the fossil fuel giants), the corporate welfarists, tax escapes of corporate crooks, those who cheat consumers and crush workers’ rights. Remember that is the way he behaved during his former failed business exploits. Nobody stopped him then and he believes the stars of his destiny will not let anyone stop him now. Trump is at his core a corporatist and a corporate statist, who pushes bloated military budgets, lawlessness and police powers, all of which are the frameworks of American fascism. Buckle your seat belts people, and start the civic resurgence. (See my piece, Rise Up: Congress is Yours for the Taking in the new issue of the Capitol Hill Citizen).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFy6vLuj96nsM	2024-11-24T15:43:05-08:00	
Trump’s Promise: What Ending Global Wars Means For US Defense And...	Donald Trump's recent announcement to end global wars if elected president has sent shockwaves through the American arms industry and international defense circles. This proclamation, while appealing to a war-weary public, raises critical questions about the future of U.S. arms exports, defense spending, and America's role in global security. To understand the potential implications, we must examine the current state of the arms industry, Trump's foreign policy stance, and the complex geopolitical landscape. The Current State of U.S. Arms Exports The United States has long been the world's leading arms exporter, a position that has only strengthened in recent years. In fiscal year 2023, U.S. foreign military sales reached a record high of $80.9 billion, marking a 55% increase from the previous year. This surge was largely driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted many European countries to bolster their defense capabilities. The U.S. government's role in facilitating these sales goes beyond mere profit-seeking. Arms exports are a crucial tool of American foreign policy, allowing the U.S. to strengthen alliances, maintain influence in strategic regions, and shape the global security landscape. The Biden administration has viewed robust arms sales as a means to counter Russian influence and support allies in an increasingly unstable world. Trump's 'End Global Wars' Stance Trump's pledge to end global wars is not entirely new. During his previous term, he often criticized U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts and pushed for a more isolationist approach. However, the specifics of how he plans to achieve this goal remain unclear. It's worth noting that despite his rhetoric, Trump's previous administration oversaw significant arms sales and military operations abroad. His approach to foreign policy was often unpredictable, combining tough talk with a desire for diplomatic breakthroughs Potential Impacts on the Arms Industry If Trump follows through on his pledge to end global wars, it could have several significant impacts on the American arms industry: 1. Reduced Demand: A shift away from interventionist policies could lead to decreased demand for U.S. weapons systems, particularly from countries involved in ongoing conflicts. 2. Shift in Product Focus: The industry might need to pivot towards developing and producing defensive systems rather than offensive weaponry. 3. Domestic Market Emphasis: With potentially reduced foreign sales, arms manufacturers may need to rely more heavily on domestic military contracts. 4. Diversification: Some companies might explore diversifying into non-military sectors to offset potential losses in arms sales. Geopolitical Considerations Trump's stance raises questions about America's role in global security and its commitments to allies. Many U.S. allies, particularly in Europe and Asia, have come to rely on American military support and technology. A sudden withdrawal or significant reduction in U.S. involvement could create power vacuums and potentially embolden adversaries like Russia and China. The situation in Ukraine serves as a prime example of the complexities involved. While Trump has expressed a desire to quickly end the conflict, doing so without considering Ukraine's sovereignty and long-term security could have far-reaching consequences for European stability and America's credibility. Economic Implications The arms industry is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, providing high-skilled jobs and driving technological innovation. Any major shift in policy that affects arms exports could have ripple effects throughout the economy, particularly in regions with a high concentration of defense contractors. However, it's important to note that reduced military spending could potentially free up resources for other sectors, such as infrastructure or renewable energy, which could offset some of the economic impacts. Challenges to Implementation Implementing a policy to 'end global wars' would face several challenges: 1. Congressional Oversight: Major arms sales require congressional approval, and many lawmakers view these sales as crucial for national security and maintaining global influence. 2. Existing Commitments: The U.S. has numerous defense agreements and ongoing operations that cannot be easily or quickly dismantled without significant diplomatic and strategic consequences. 3. Industry Pushback: The powerful defense lobby is likely to resist any policies that could significantly reduce arms sales. 4. Geopolitical Realities: Global conflicts and tensions are often driven by complex factors beyond U.S. control, making it difficult to simply 'end' wars by decree. The Role of Diplomacy Trump's emphasis on ending wars could potentially lead to a greater focus on diplomacy and negotiation. This shift might create opportunities for conflict resolution and peace-building initiatives. However, critics argue that reducing military support for allies could weaken America's bargaining position in diplomatic negotiations. Technological Considerations The arms industry has been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technologies, from artificial intelligence to hypersonic weapons. A significant reduction in military spending or arms exports could potentially slow the pace of innovation in these areas. Conversely, it might also encourage the industry to find civilian applications for military technologies, potentially driving innovation in other sectors. Global Arms Market Dynamics Any major shift in U.S. arms export policy would likely have significant impacts on the global arms market. Other major exporters, such as France, Russia, and China, might seek to fill any void left by reduced U.S. sales. This could lead to a realignment of global arms trade patterns and potentially affect the balance of power in various regions. Domestic Political Considerations Trump's pledge to end global wars may resonate with a public weary of long-term military engagements. However, it could also face opposition from those who view a strong military presence abroad as essential for national security. Donald Trump's pledge to end global wars, if implemented, would mark a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy with far-reaching implications for the American arms industry. While potentially reducing military engagements abroad, such a policy would face numerous challenges and could reshape global security dynamics. The arms industry, which has long been a cornerstone of American economic and strategic power, would need to adapt to a changing landscape. This could involve pivoting towards defensive technologies, exploring new markets, or diversifying into non-military sectors. Ultimately, the fate of the American arms industry under a potential Trump presidency would depend on the specific policies implemented, global geopolitical developments, and the industry's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. As the debate over America's role in the world continues, the arms industry finds itself at a crossroads, facing both challenges and opportunities in an uncertain future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF9RB809r9qnu	2024-11-24T15:41:25-08:00	
Trump ‘Incredibly Concerned’ About Escalation Of Munitions In Rus...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is 'incredibly concerned' about the escalating use of different types of weaponry in Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine, his designated choice for national security adviser said Sunday. Michael Waltz, now a Florida congressman, told 'Fox News Sunday' that the decision by the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use anti-personnel land mines to try to halt Russia’s battlefield ground troop advances has turned the fight in eastern Ukraine into something akin to 'World War I trench warfare.' Waltz said the decision 'needs to be within a broader framework to end this conflict.' 'It is just an absolute meat grinder of people and personnel on that front,' he said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week the United States is sending the anti-personnel mines to Ukraine because of the changing nature of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the main battlefield. He said Russian ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading Moscow’s advance, so Ukraine has 'a need for things that can help slow down that effort.' Waltz said Trump, who takes office January 20, is concerned about the carnage but said that in the broad picture, the question that must be preeminent is, 'How do we restore deterrence and how do we bring peace?' 'We need to, we need to bring this to a responsible end,' he added. Trump has often claimed that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war even before he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president. Trump has never said how and refused to say during a campaign debate in September that he wants Ukraine to win. Biden gave Ukraine authority to launch Washington-supplied missiles with a 300-kilometer range deep into Russia in response to North Korea’s dispatch of 10,000 troops to fight alongside Moscow’s forces. Within two days, Kyiv targeted weapons warehouses in Russia’s Bryansk region with the missiles. Then, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a new experimental rocket, targeting Dnipro in Ukraine’s eastern region. 'This is a clear escalation,' Waltz said. 'Where is this escalation going? How do we get both sides to the table' for peace negotiations? Waltz, whose appointment does not require Senate confirmation, said he has been meeting with Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. Waltz said that any U.S. adversary 'is wrong' if it thinks it can 'play one side off against the other' with the switch in power in Washington from Biden, a Democrat, and his long-time political foe, Trump, a Republican. Waltz said he is 'confident' Trump will restore peace 'in pretty short order' in the multiple conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel fighting Iran-funded militants — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But months of cease-fire talks on the conflict in Gaza are stalemated and talks to reach a halt in the Hezbollah-Israel fighting have yet to produce a deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF5udE0KpbDHJ	2024-11-24T15:39:33-08:00	
Mikati Warns Israeli Military Action In Lebanon A Rejection Of Po...	By Najia Houssari An Israeli strike on a Lebanese army center on Sunday killed a soldier and wounded 18 others, the Lebanese military said, with the caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, calling the attack 'a direct bloody message rejecting all efforts to reach a ceasefire.' The attack came as top EU diplomat Josep Borrell called for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war while on a visit to Lebanon. According to the Lebanese Army Command, the first adjutant, Diab Mohammed Jaafar, was killed when Israel targeted Al-Amariyeh checkpoint on the road between Tyre and the town of Naqoura. In a statement, Mikati said: 'Israel’s messages rejecting a solution are ongoing, and just as it turned against the US-French call for a ceasefire in September, here it is once again responding with Lebanese blood, blatantly rejecting the solution that is being discussed.' He called on 'the countries of the world and the relevant international institutions to assume their responsibilities on the issue.' Mikati’s condemnation came amid growing concerns that the Israeli military is trying to solidify its westward incursion in the coastal town of Al-Bayada, located between Tyre and Naqoura, while facing strong resistance from the eastern side of the border area in its positions in Khiyam. Israeli forces are trying to encircle the South Litani area from both sides. Hezbollah said it 'targeted a gathering of the enemy army s forces east of the city of Khiyam with a salvo of rockets,' and 'a gathering of Israeli forces at the Metula site (Israel’s outlet toward Khiyam) was targeted with a volley of rockets followed by an aerial attack with a squadron of assault drones … hitting its targets accurately.' The Israeli military said Hezbollah launched 160 projectiles toward Israel on Sunday. Sirens sounded across northern and central Israel, reaching Tel Aviv at successive intervals, forcing thousands of Israelis to head toward shelters. Footage from central Israel showed extensive material damage and fires. The Israeli military issued further warnings to residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate, targeting Bourj Al-Barajneh and Hadath. Former Israeli minister Benny Gantz claimed that the Lebanese government 'is leaving Hezbollah unchecked,' adding: 'It is time to act against its assets forcefully.' These developments came during a round of discussions conducted by Borrell, high representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy, in Beirut with Mikati and Speaker Nabih Berry. In a statement, Borrell stressed the need for exerting pressure on Israel and Hezbollah to accept the US proposal for a ceasefire. Borrell emphasized that 'the situation in the Middle East, particularly here in Beirut, presents a significant challenge to the international community. The international community cannot remain inactive in the face of these events. The absence of peace in the Middle East has reached an intolerable level, and people are dying under bombardment.' He added that two months on from his last visit to Beirut, he now views Lebanon as on the verge of collapse due to the conflict, which has led to the devastation of numerous villages, as well as airstrikes aimed at Beirut and Baalbek. He also reiterated that 'the human cost is exceedingly high.' Borrell said Israeli airstrikes had claimed the lives of over 3,500 people in Lebanon, a figure three times greater than the casualties recorded in 2006. The only viable path forward, Borrell said, is an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701. Borrell praised the UNIFIL forces and confirmed the EU’s readiness to allocate &euro;200 million ($208.3 million) to the Lebanese Armed Forces. He emphasized the Lebanese need to 'assume their political responsibilities by electing a president and putting an end to this prolonged power vacuum that has exceeded two years.' Borrell said a ceasefire proposal for Gaza is pending Israeli government approval, and 'we, as the international community, need to work to ensure the respect of international law, as we see famine being used as a weapon of war through international law violations, the complete siege imposed on Gaza and the number of people that are dying in Lebanon.' He added that in his view the decisions of the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, for Israel’s activities in Gaza were not politically motivated and had been made under international law, which applied to everyone. 'We strongly support the court,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF3x9MCMotad2	2024-11-24T15:37:43-08:00	
Austin Bolsters US Cooperation With Fiji, Concludes 12th Trip To ...	By Joseph Clark Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III signed a new agreement Saturday aimed at enhancing the United States' logistics cooperation with Fiji today as he closed out his 12th trip to the Indo-Pacific since taking office. The Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement is aimed at enabling the efficient transfer of fuel and medical supplies and the use of maintenance facilities during emergencies, culminating nearly a decade of negotiations between the two countries and underscoring the United States' commitment to building lasting partnerships throughout the region. 'This agreement will mean closer ties and closer logistics cooperation between our forces, including for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,' Austin said during a press conference. The secretary signed to new agreement alongside Fijian officials during a ceremony today at Black Rock Camp. Ahead of the ceremony, Austin met with Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General Baron Waqa for discussions on bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Fiji. In addition to finalizing the ACSA agreement, the two countries announced the beginning of formal negotiations on a Status of Forces Agreement that will empower the two countries to work more closely together. Austin also announced that the U.S. will provide $4.9 million in foreign military financing for small-arms recapitalization for Fijian forces, pending Congressional approval. Austin said continuing to strengthen the U.S.-Fijian relationship remains as a key focal point in the region. 'Our relationship is rooted in common values and our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,' he said. 'The Indo-Pacific is our priority theater and our partnership with Fiji and other Pacific Island Countries is vital to a free and open Indo-Pacific.' Austin's visit to Fiji, the first by a U.S. defense secretary, caps a series of engagements with regional counterparts showcasing the United States' unwavering commitment to the Indo-Pacific amid what Austin sees as a 'new convergence' of like-minded partners throughout the region. In addition to Fiji, Austin met with key U.S. partners in Australia, the Philippines and Laos in a continuation to the regional momentum he has built throughout his tenure. In Darwin, Australia, Austin met with Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles and Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani Gen as part of the 14th Trilateral Defense Minister's Meeting. In a joint statement following the TDMM, the three leaders announced that Japan will increase its participation in Australia-U.S. force posture cooperation activities, including through annual trilateral amphibious training among the Australian Defense Force, Japan Ground Self Defense Force's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and the U.S. Marine Rotational Force – Darwin. The joint statement also outlines steps to increase intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance cooperation throughout the Indo-Pacific, to include Australia's participation in the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Information Analysis Cell. Following his visit to Darwin, Austin proceeded to the Philippines where he met with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. and Philippine Secretary of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro. While there, Austin and Teodoro attended an official signing ceremony for the newly established General Security of Military Information Agreement, that provides a legal framework enabling enhanced and expanded sharing of information and defense technology between the two countries. The agreement serves as a foundation for further enhancing interoperability between U.S. and Philippine forces and paves the way for additional security agreements in the future. Austin and Teodoro also broke ground on a new combined coordination center at Camp Aguinaldo in Manila to further enable information sharing between U.S. and Philippine forces. Later, Austin met with Marcos at Malacanang Palace in Manila where the secretary further underscored the strong ties between the two countries. Before departing the Philippines, Austin observed a Philippine Navy technical demonstration showcasing T-12 unmanned surface vessels provided by the U.S. through foreign military financing. The T-12 is a key capability used by Philippine forces to protect its sovereignty and operate throughout its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. Austin's stop in the Philippines was his fourth visit to the country since taking office, the most visits ever by a U.S. secretary of defense. In Laos, Austin attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus. U.S. defense secretaries have participated in the forum since 2010 when it was established by the 10-member block of Southeast Asian nations. Austin met with a range of regional allies and partners on during the forum and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to regional security. He also announced the first-ever U.S. Defense Department vision statement for a prosperous and secure Southeast Asia. The statement outlines the U.S. vision for deepening our practical cooperation across Southeast Asia. Austin also announced during the two-day series of engagements that ASEAN member states approved a second iteration of a U.S.-led maritime exercise with ASEAN countries, which was first held in 2019. 'We've been focused on working with countries, like minded countries to promote an open and secure Indo-Pacific region where countries can protect their interests and also feel free to sail international waterways and fly international skies wherever international law will allow,' Austin said today in discussing his most recent trip to the Indo-Pacific and, more broadly, the United States' progress over the past four years in strengthening ties throughout the region. 'We've accomplished a great deal,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF18i5kwdxT2n	2024-11-24T15:36:26-08:00	
Iran Confirms Plan For Talks With EU3	The Iranian Foreign Ministry affirmed that diplomats from Iran and the European troika will be holding talks about regional and international issues as well as Iran’s nuclear program. Spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry Esmaeil Baqaei announced on Sunday that deputy foreign ministers of Iran, France, the UK and Germany will convene on Friday, November 29, to discuss a range of bilateral, regional and international issues. Highlighting Iran’s policy of 'interaction and cooperation with the other countries' on the basis of respect, wisdom and expediency, Baqaei said the upcoming negotiations with the EU3 will be held as a continuation of the talks that had been held on the sidelines of the annual session of the UN General Assembly in New York. 'In the upcoming round of talks, which had been already planned in New York, a spectrum of subjects and regional and international topics will be discussed, including the issue of Palestine and Lebanon, as well as the nuclear issue,' he added. His comments came after Japan’s Kyodo News quoted Iranian diplomatic sources as saying on Sunday that Iran and the EU3 will hold talks in Geneva on the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF_hwhj6GpDnW	2024-11-24T15:34:57-08:00	
Maldives Embraces India Fully, Disengaging From China – Analysis	An Indo-Maldivian Comprehensive Economic and Defence Partnership Agreement is on the cards. Maldives was ardently pro-China from 2013 to 2018 during the Presidency of Abdulla Yameen. But it swung completely to the Indian side when Ibrahim Solih replaced Yameen. However, when Yameen's protégé, Mohamed Muizzu, won the Presidential election in 2023, he gave every indication of a swing back to China. But things turned topsy-turvy when India asserted itself strongly and balanced it by granting much-needed financial assistance to Maldives at a time when China offered no help, Muizzu buried the hatchet and embraced India wholeheartedly. With India and Maldives getting closer by the day, the two countries are aiming at signing a Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership Agreement (CEMSPA). During the meeting between the Maldivian President Dr.Mohamed Muizzzu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on October 7, the leaders acknowledged that it was an opportune time for both sides to chart a new framework for cooperation with an aim to comprehensively transform the bilateral relationship to a 'Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership' which is people-centric and future-oriented and be an anchor of stability in the Indian Ocean Region. The latest in the series of Indo-Maldivian agreement was the MOU signed in New Delhi between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Maldivian Monetary Authority (MMA) to allow the use of the Maldivian Rufiyya and the Indian Rupee in Maldives-India trade. Indo-Maldivian bilateral trade is of the order of US$ 485 million. Between August 2023 and August 2024 the exports of India increased by US$ 41.7 million (104%) from S$ 40 million US$ 81.7 million, while imports increased by US$ 7.48 million (30.8%) from US$ 24.3 million to US$ 31.8 million. Uses of Local Currencies Trade The framework envisaged by the RBI-MMA MOU will enable exporters and importers to invoice and settle in their respective domestic currencies, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of trading in the INR-MVR pair in the foreign exchange market. The use of local currencies will optimise costs and reduce settlement time for transactions, the RBI said in a statement. 'The MoU encourages the use of INR and MVR in current account transactions, permissible capital account transactions, and any other economic and financial transactions as agreed upon by both countries,' an RBI statement said. The costs of the dependence on currencies outside of the region for the settlement of trade in the region results in cost for changing currencies for trade settlement; the instability in export prices in response to exchange rate changes and costs of hedging exchange rate risks. In contrast, the merits of using the local currencies for trade settlement reveals encouraging efficiency in trade and investment transactions; lowering the above mentioned costs; enhancing export competitiveness arising from cost effectiveness; and promoting trade and investment at the firm, country and regional levels. The RBI-MMA agreement will allow businesses in both countries to invoice and settle transactions in their respective domestic currencies, with the framework aiming to facilitate trading in the Maldivian Rufiyaa and Indian Rupee (MVR-INR) currency pair within the foreign exchange market, the Maldives' central bank said. The arrangement will enable businesses in both markets to pay for the import and export of goods and services with their local currencies. The use of local currencies would also reduce costs and improve settlement times, the MMA highlighted. 'This MoU is a significant step forward in enhancing trade and financial ties between the Maldives and India. By enabling the use of local currencies for bilateral transactions, it will strengthen economic cooperation, promote trade, and foster closer financial integration between the two countries,' the MMA said in a statement 'This collaboration marks a key milestone in strengthening bilateral cooperation between the RBI and MMA,' the RBI added, noting that the use of local currencies in bilateral transactions will eventually contribute to promoting trade between India and Maldives, deepen financial integration, and strengthen economic relations between the two countries. Growing Ties During President Muizzu's visit to New Delh in October, the two countries signed a bilateral currency swap agreement enabling the Maldives' central bank to draw a swap facility under two windows; a USD/EUR window and an INR window, respectively, against the MVR. The swap facility would allow the MMA to make multiple drawals up to a maximum limit of US$400 million in addition to INR 30 billion, within the existing 'Framework on Currency Swap Arrangement for SAARC Countries, 2024-2027'. The USD/EUR swap facility is aimed at supporting the Maldives' foreign exchange liquidity requirements, while the INR swap facility would allow trade settlement in local currencies. The Maldivian President thanked India for its timely emergency financial assistance, including by way of rolling over Treasury-bills subscribed by the State Bank of India amounting to USD 100 million in May and September 2024 for a further period of one year that provided the much needed financial cushion for Maldives in addressing its urgent financing needs. He expressed appreciation for the decision of the Government of India to extend support in the form of USD 400 million and INR 30 billion as a bilateral currency swap agreement, instrumental in tackling the ongoing financial challenges faced by the Maldives. India has agreed to extend full support for the timely completion of the flagship Greater Malé Connectivity Project (GMCP), and to undertake a feasibility study to connect the islands of Thilafushi and Giraavaru as an extension. The two leaders also agreed to develop a state-of-the-art commercial port at Thilafushi island in order to de-congest the Malé port and provide enhanced cargo handling capacity at Thilafushi. The two countries have decided to explore collaboration for development of transshipment facilities and bunkering services contributing towards Maldives Economic Gateway project at Ihavandhippolhu and Gaadhoo islands of Maldives; and to jointly work in harnessing the full potential of Hanimaadhoo and Gan airports that are being developed with Indian assistance as well as other airports of Maldives. Towards this end, both sides will also consider measures to strengthen air connectivity, attract investments and collaborate for efficient management of these airports. Modi and Muizzu decided to establish an 'Agriculture Economic Zone' and tourism investments in Haa Dhaalu atoll and fish processing and canning facility at Haa Alifu atoll with Indian assistance and to further expand through additional financing the successful High Impact Community Development Projects to take the India-Maldives people-centric development partnership to every part of Maldives. FTA In view of significant untapped potential for bilateral trade & investment, the two sides agreed to initiate discussions on a Bilateral Free Trade Agreement focusing on trade in goods and services between the two countries and to promote bilateral investments and closer engagements between the two business chambers and entities; steps shall be taken for disseminating information relating to investment opportunities and to improve ease of doing business; A decision was also taken to enhance efforts to boost tourism between the two countries through marketing campaigns and collaborative efforts and share expertise on implementation of digital and financial services. In this context, there was a decision to cooperate in the domain of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) by launch of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Unique Digital Identity, Gati Shakti Scheme and other digital services that will enhance e-governance and delivery of services through digital domain for the benefit of people of Maldives. While welcoming the launch of RuPay card in Maldives, which will enhance ease of payments for Indian tourists visiting Maldives, the two countries decided to work closely to extend similar services for Maldivian nationals visiting India. Energy Cooperation Given the role of energy security in ensuring sustainable development, the two sides agreed to explore cooperation through implementation of solar power and other renewable energy and energy efficiency projects to bring down energy costs and enable Maldives to achieve its NDC Goals, both sides will establish a framework for an institutional partnership which will include training, exchange of visits, joint research, technical projects and promotion of investments. Towards this end, both sides will also undertake a feasibility study to identify measures that would enable Maldives to participate in the One Sun One World One Grid initiative. Defence & Security Cooperation India and Maldives share common challenges in the Indian Ocean Region which have multi-dimensional implications for the security and development of both the countries. They resolved to work together in advancing the maritime and security cooperation for the benefit of peoples of both India and Maldives as well as for the larger Indian Ocean Region. Maldives, with its vast Exclusive Economic Zone, is exposed to traditional and non-traditional maritime challenges including piracy, IUU fishing, drug smuggling, and terrorism. The two countries agreed that India will work closely with Maldives in sharing of expertise, augmenting capabilities and undertake joint cooperative measures, as per needs and requirements of Maldives. The also agreed that the ongoing Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) 'Ekatha' harbour project at Uthuru Thila Falhu (UTF) with India's assistance will significantly contribute towards enhancing MNDF's operational capabilities, and agreed to extend full support for its timely completion. The two sides also agreed to support Maldives with provisioning of defence platforms and assets to augment capabilities of MNDF as well as that of the Government of Maldives in advancing its maritime and security requirements in line with its national priorities; India will support Maldives in enhancing surveillance and monitoring capability of MNDF with the provisioning of radar systems and other equipment. India will also support Maldives on Hydrographic matters, including, through capacity building and training, as per the requirements of the Government of Maldives. India will assist Maldives in the domain of Information Sharing by supporting the development of capabilities through infrastructure, training and sharing of best practices. It will inaugurate at an early date the state-of-the-art Maldivian Ministry of Defence (MoD) building in Malé, constructed with India's assistance, that will augment modern infrastructural capacity of the MoD.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EGX59dic3WUj	2024-11-23T17:27:28-08:00	
What Lies Ahead: Understanding Trump’s Return To Power – Analysis	By Manoj Joshi Donald Trump’s victory will lead to major changes in almost all policy areas in the United States (US), from tariffs and immigration to the Ukraine war. How they will be prioritised is another matter. Characteristically, Trump also appears to grapple with personal challenges, including a strong inclination to address perceived or actual slights and instances of perceived persecution. The coming Trump era could well be the most unpredictable and disruptive in our times. His appointments indicate that he intends to fulfil his election pledges, especially on immigration. Beyond policy and personal foibles, the US elections hold immense significance. Till now, the first Trump presidency has often been viewed as an aberration and the Biden term as the norm. Now, however, it is the latter which seems to be a discontinuity. The second Trump term, which has been an all-round victory for the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) forces, will now be the norm for the US in the near future. The Trump win was not a defeat of liberalism, with its emphasis on individual rights, the rule of law, and constitutional checks on the state. It was one for neo-liberalism, which pushed globalism, abandoned the working class, and emphasised money-making over everything else. The American working class was wiped out as manufacturing relocated to Asia. Instead of their plight, neoliberal Democrats focused on narrower strands of the deprived—racial minorities, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and so on. As deprived people, they were often given a leg up, even as the original working class sank and became increasingly susceptible to the appeal of MAGA politics. While this originally attracted the white working class, Trump succeeded in getting the support of the Black and Latino working class as well. Many people think that Trumpism will be a self-limiting disease. That the impossibility of achieving the contradictory set of objectives it has set for itself will temper Trump’s impact. For instance, take the issue of tariffs. Trump said last month, 'tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.' Most economists agreed that 10-20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports tariffs will raise prices in the US. There is a school of thought which believes that enacting tariffs will be a negotiating tactic, and nothing more. If this is so, there are two possible outcomes—other countries will lower their trade barriers, or, the more likely outcome, retaliate with their own tariffs. This will lead to an inflationary situation, something that Trump should know proved to be poison for the Democrats in this election. The big target is Mexico. Trump has declared that he will raise tariffs 200 or 500 percent: 'I don’t care. I’ll put a number where they can’t sell one car' (in the US). Currently, Mexico is the US’ biggest trade partner and has sold 2.55 million cars in the US in 2023. Tariffs would hit companies like Honda, Toyota, and Volkswagen, but it would also affect American companies like Ford, General Motors (GM), and Stellantis, whose supply chains extend to Mexico, while also using the country as a manufacturing base. For Mexico, it will be a double whammy, since the largest number of undocumented migrants to be deported are from the same country. With regards to immigration, Trump wants to close the border and begin the process of deporting up to 11 million undocumented migrants. He has appointed hard-liners Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan to undertake this task, signalling his intention of fulfilling his campaign promises. This is no ordinary task as this community is now woven into the US’ social and economic fabric. Vice President J. D. Vance has said that the target is to deport some 1 million illegal immigrants per year. Prising them out, setting up detention centres, overcoming legal challenges and encouraging them to return to their homelands could take years. It will also affect the economy since migrants are the backbone of agriculture and construction industries, and their presence has helped keep wages in check. A deportation process is likely to lead to inflation. In many of these areas, the real question is what Trump will decide to focus on. Apparently, there are no less than 40 agendas he has promised to begin pursuing from his first day in office. Definitely, avenging himself against those he says have persecuted him in the Biden administration will be a priority. Among the targeted persons could be Jack Smith, former Attorney General Merrick Garland, as well as Trump’s friends-turned-enemies such as John Kelly, former Joint Chief of Staff, Chairman General Mark Milley, and Liz Cheney. Another strand of his policy will be a change in the rules to allow the firing of any federal official. There could be large-scale firings, accompanied by the appointment of MAGA supportors in their positions. Foreign policy is an area that will experience a big change. The likely appointment of Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State signals a hardline approach. Rubio is known for his hawkish positions on Iran, China, and Venezuela, as well as his support for Israel’s campaign in Gaza. Ukraine is likely to be a big loser, though the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) could also find itself in crosshairs. Both the US and European Union (EU) short-changed the Ukrainians in the last two years through their niggling weapons supply policies. Now Ukraine may be forced to cede territory to achieve peace, even while NATO’s status hangs in the air. JD Vance has suggested that the aim would be to have Russia and Ukraine ceasefire along the current frontlines, which means a loss of around 18 percent of Ukrainian territory that Russia has occupied since 2022. The Vance plan would also guarantee Ukrainian neutrality towards Russia. As for Israel, Trump will be more supportive of Israeli military activities and would not, like the Biden Administration, use US military assistance as leverage to push Israeli policy in any specific direction. According to the Times of Israel, Trump has told Netanyahu that he wants an end to the Gaza war by the time he takes office on 20 January 2025. But there are other issues where the US position will benefit Israel as well—particularly, destroying Hezbollah in Lebanon and dealing with Iran. Trump had walked away from the nuclear deal with Tehran and begun a campaign of 'maximum pressure,' with harsh sanctions to push Iran to end its nuclear programme and its policy of arming regional proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. There is a lot of talk about Trump’s hardline views on China. But people often forget that in January 2020, he willingly signed a trade deal with China. There is no reason to believe that another such deal could not take place and also include the status of Taiwan also in it. America is in trouble. Its polarisation has deepened with this election and Trump’s attacks on the government have weakened the important infrastructure of American power. There is little doubt that the West-led multilateral world order that was put in place after World War II is headed for a change. It has been showing strain for some time now, but the MAGA victory could have sounded the death knell. The UN Security Council (SC) is more or less frozen with the divisions between Russia, China, and the West. As for the World Trade Organization (WTO), Trump has ensured that its appellate function was torpedoed in 2016, and now, with a tariff war around the corner, there is little chance that it will be able to do anything about that. The Biden administration had strongly backed NATO and America’s East Asian allies—Japan, South Korea, Philippines and Australia. In the case of NATO, Trump has questioned whether the US would honour the alliance’s mutual defence clause and has actually suggested that he would encourage Russia to 'to do whatever the hell they want' to any NATO country that doesn’t pay enough. All this is not necessarily bad. Countries of the Global South could benefit from the US’ retreat from its dominant role in world affairs. The new multilateralism fostered by organisations like BRICS could reshape the world to better serve Indian interests. But this is no ordinary task, this new multilateralism will have to go beyond its penchant for declarations and deliver results on the ground.

China’s Increasing Global Drone Footprint – Analysis	By Abhishek Kumar Darbey China has established the world’ largest Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) industry. It has become the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs, with its signature models—the Wing Loong and Rainbow Series UAV.1 According to the SIPRI Arms Transfer Database, between 2008 and 2018, China exported a total of 181 fighter/combat drones and 163 strike-capable UAVs. The UAE (22 per cent), Saudi Arabia (19 per cent), Egypt (15 per cent) and Pakistan (14 per cent) have been the most significant recipients of Chinese drones, during this time period.2 According to the SIPRI, China has delivered more than 200 combat drones to 17 countries in the period 2013–2023.3 Chinese Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) have been used on battlefields in the Middle East and Africa. For instance, the Nigerian Air Force has been using CH-3 fighter drone in operations against Boko Haram, and Saudi Arabia has used Wing Loong II drones in the war against Houthi militias in Yemen. Egypt uses Wing Loong-II fighter drones against militant groups in north Sinai.4 In Iraq, Chinese combat drones carried out 260 air raids against ISIL (ISIS) targets as of mid-2018, with a success rate of nearly 100 per cent.5 Iraq had purchased four CH-4B Rainbow fighter drones in 2015. Saudi Arabia has been one of the oldest and regular customers of Chinese drones, and has imported 70 Chinese combat drones. Saudi Arabia first purchased a few CH-4 drones in 2014 and has since acquired at least 15 of the more lethal Wing Loong II drones, with an expressed interest to buy 285 more. China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) has set up a drone manufacturing unit in Saudi Arabia after the agreement was reached between Xi Jinping and King Salman in February 2017. The state-owned Saudi Technology Development and Investment Company (TAQNIA) and CASC subsidiary Aerospace Long-March International Trade (ALIT) have worked on establishing this manufacturing unit. Abu Dhabi was the first export customer for the Wing Loong II drones, and received the first units in 2017.6 Similarly, China sold at least five Wing Loong I drones to UAE in 2011. In early 2017, the UAE purchased five Wing Loong II fighter drones. The Pakistani Air Force purchased five CH-4 Rainbow combat drones in January 2021,7 and in May 2024, Pakistan ordered 10 more CH-4 Rainbow-series of combat drones at around US$ 24 million.8 In 2013, Myanmar purchased 12 CH-3 fighter drones.9 The Serbian military has purchased CH-92A Reconnaissance/Attack drones worth US$ 19.3 million in June 2020.10 Chinese drones are cheaper than their Western counterparts, and therefore, are more appealing to those countries with limitations of budget. The CH-4 and the Wing Loong 2 are estimated to cost between US$ 1 m and US$ 2 m each, while the US-made Reaper costs US$ 16m and the Predator US$ 4m, according to CSIS, the US-based think tank. China also offers flexible payment terms to interested buyers, and many African buyers pay the amount in terms of oil and other natural resources.11 China is able to keep pace with the market demands of military drones in terms of innovation and quality, as regards flight control, integrated navigation, relay data link system, sensor technology, among others.12[xii] China has successfully developed dozens of new generation military unmanned aerial vehicles, models and prototypes, including stealth unmanned aerial vehicles, foldable wing unmanned aerial vehicles, short-distance take-off and landing ring-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, micro unmanned aerial vehicles and flying wing unmanned aerial vehicles.13 In order to increase its market share, China is investing to upgrade its drone manufacturing units. In late 2021, Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group (Chengfei), a subsidiary of China Aviation Industry Corporation, signed an agreement with the Zigong Municipal Government of Sichuan to jointly build ‘the largest domestic UAV industrial base (无人机工业园区)’ worth 10 billion Yuan (US$ 1.55 billion) to manufacture military and commercial UAVs. It got operationalised in 2023.14 PLA and Military Uses of Drones China has a number of UAVs in service with the PLA Rocket Force, PLA Ground Force/Army, PLA Air Force and PLA Navy.15 The PLA is currently equipped with several long-endurance reconnaissance and strike drones. For example, the PLA Air Force’s drone brigade uses the Wing Loong-2 (GJ-2) drone, and the PLA Army uses Rainbow-4 reconnaissance and strike drone. According to Chinese media reports, the PLA Army has begun using KVD002 medium-altitude long-flight reconnaissance and strike drone at the theatre command and group army levels, unveiled in September 2023.16 The TB-001 drone is not just a reconnaissance and strike drone, but can be used along with the PLA Rocket Force’s anti-ship ballistic missiles.17 In August 2021, the China Central Television (CCTV) disclosed that the PLA Rocket Force had mastered the ability to accurately hit large mobile ships thousands of kilometers away at sea by guiding the DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles. China has improved its applications of drone for patrolling its land borders as well as coastlines, and particularly along the Sino-Indian border and Taiwan Strait. PLA’s UAV troops have been deployed in large numbers in the Western Theatre Command. At present, PLA has deployed ‘GJ-2’ drones and ‘Rainbow-4’ drones in the Western Theatre Command for reconnaissance activities along the borders. In 2019, the AV500W reconnaissance and strike integrated helicopter was also deployed on the Tibetan plateau. This unmanned helicopter weighs 450 kilograms and has a ceiling of 6,700 meters. It can carry four small laser-guided air-to-surface missiles to accurately strike enemy personnel and light vehicles.18 Similarly, China has been using its drones to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance activities in the East China Sea, Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Japan and Taiwan reported Chinese drone patrols over their claimed waters. In May 2024, the Japanese Ministry of Defense reported that the WZ-10 UAV flew over the East China Sea and approached Japan.19 PLA used the BZK-005 and TB-001 drones to fly into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. Both drones have reconnaissance and attack capabilities. The BZK-005 is a large multi-purpose drone with a maximum endurance of 40 hours, and its cruising altitude is 3,000 to 7,000 meters.20 Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed on 25 August 2023 that two Chinese drones flew around Taiwan for nearly 24 hours. The two Chinese drones identified were reconnaissance/attack drone ‘TB001’ and the reconnaissance drone ‘BZK005’.21 In August 2024, a Wing Loong 10 was seen flying along the Vietnamese coastline to the southern city of Nha Trang.22 In recent times, China has entered into foreign collaborations to develop military drones. On 25 September, Reuters reported that Russian UAV company IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned arms company Almaz-Antey, is working with Chinese specialists to develop a new drone model called Garpiya-3 (G3), which is a 2,000 km range attack drone. Another Russian firm Redlepus TSK Vector Industrial has set up 80-hectare ‘Advanced UAV Research and Manufacturing Base’ in Shenzhen in China that would be able to produce 800 long-range attack drones per year, similar to G3 attack drones. 23 Conclusion The Chinese military is gradually being equipped with drones of increasing lethality and capabilities. Chinese defence universities have special programmes to train PLA soldiers majoring in drone technology and applications. Chinese drone manufacturers such as DJI have captured a significant chunk of global civilian drone market. According to the 2023–2024 China Drone Development Report released by the China Air Transport Association, as of the end of August 2024, nearly 2 million drones were registered in China, an increase of 720,000 from the end of 2023. By 2025, the output of China’s civilian drones is expected to exceed 200 billion yuan.24 Chinese military drones, meanwhile, are widely being used in conflict hotspots across the world, particularly so in Africa and the Middle East. The PLA has intensified the military drones R&D as well as manufacturing activities. Going forward, the global footprint of Chinese military as well as civilian drone programmes is only expected to grow exponentially.

Germany At A Crossroads: Coalition Breakdown Portends Sweeping Ch...	By Melanie Banerjee On November 6, shortly after the results of the 2024 US elections became clear, Germany was plunged into political uncertainty when Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a confidence vote for January 2025. Given the flagging popularity of the coalition government, the confidence vote is likely to result in snap elections in February, well ahead of the expected date of September 2025. The catalyst for these events traces back to a leaked policy position paper from Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), which proposed policies in stark contrast to the FDP’s coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens. The paper, titled Economic Transition for Germany: Economic Concepts for Growth and Intergenerational Fairness, contradicts and negates key aspects of coalition policy, including climate action, social security, taxation, and Germany’s Sonderweg thesis (the ‘unique path’). The disclosure effectively fractured the coalition, with Chancellor Scholz dismissing FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leaving the SPD and Greens to rule in as a minority government. Now evidently heading into early elections, the question arises: How will Germany’s economic transformation be impacted if these ideas are given central political consideration? Let’s examine. A Challenge to Germany’s Top-down Welfare State Germany takes pride in its socialist politics, which became a touchstone for modern Germany following the world wars, and whose emergence broadly shaped the German political economy of the 19th century before paving the way from aristocracy to democracy. These politics have been influenced by the Sonderweg thesis, which asserts the importance of German exceptionalism in the West. This school of thought believes in democracy and social reforms as a top-down approach, wherein the state is responsible for initiating and implementing reforms without demands ‘from below.’ In this context, for example, the German government drafted an enactment in May aimed at stabilizing pension levels and creating a generational capital fund for the Statutory Pension Insurance System. The leaked policy paper from Finance Minister Christian Lindner argues against this top-down welfare model, stating that it is unsustainable from a budgetary perspective and exhibits anti-emancipatory characteristics that burden future generations. He also supported the debt brake (Schuldenbremse), a provision in the German Constitution (Basic Law) that limits government spending when potential revenues are insufficient. Lindner has described the rising costs of an ageing population as an intergenerational injustice that negatively impacts national finances. Various academics and policymakers have roundly criticized Lindner’s stance. The full impact of this policy shift won’t become apparent until the 2025 elections have run their course. But by risking concessions to Germany’s elderly population, in the context of a stagnant workforce and income levels, there is a growing opportunity for the rise of neo-Marxist ideals, which view retirees as rent-seekers, further exacerbating economic imbalances. Moreover, this assumption implicitly regards pensions as passive income, without considering factors such as investment expenses, income taxes on returns, personal spending, or charitable contributions. An obstinate focus on combining growth parameters with medium- and long-term political strategies, without factoring in economic consumption as part of the rate of capital or wealth growth, risks jeopardizing the future of the federal German economy. This approach may foster the belief that pensioners are not active participants in the economy, leading to the misguided notion that the growth rate of wealth is negative. Climate Policies on the Chopping Block The latest draft of Germany’s 2025 budget prioritized commitments to address negative climate impacts on the economy, allotting special funds to trigger the clean energy transition, especially in sectors such as affordable housing, supply chains, and EV charging. However, Finance Minister Christian Lindner has increasingly referred to Germany’s budget position on the Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF), adopted by the federal government in August 2024, as ‘politically enforced decarbonization,’ arguing that it is a leading cause of capital shocks to public finances, resulting in sluggish investments. Despite ongoing legislative proceedings that are expected to finalize the fund’s implementation by 2025, Lindner’s policy position does not address the constitutional mandate to re-draft the 2024 budget, following the Constitutional Court’s ruling on the debt limit in November 2023. The dissolution of the ruling coalition is likely to cast a shadow over the future of German climate policy, risking increased bureaucratic pressure and negative consequences for the implementation of the KTF. Furthermore, any bureaucratic delays in meeting Germany’s 2045 emissions targets will complicate the country’s industrial transition to renewable energy. Despite mounting pressures, Lindner has overlooked the position of Germany’s farming sector, which will be one of the most affected by these developments. The sector is already grappling with hyperinflation due to rising national CO2 emissions pricing, which also impacts transportation and heating. According to the DG Agriculture and Rural Development’s 2nd Report (EU Commission, Spring 2024), Germany was ranked among the top three Western European countries unable to afford a proper meal in 2022, surpassing the EU average. Additionally, the latest Global Food Security Index of 2022, published by Economist Impact, places Germany in the red for food security and access, ranking it 80th globally—among the lowest in high-income countries. The negative rating is attributed to a lack of a comprehensive food security strategy and agency, with no improvement since 2012. The collapse of the Traffic Light coalition has paved the way for a rise in pro-corporate political approaches in the upcoming snap elections of 2025, likely accompanied by demands for public budget allocations for subsidies and tax cuts. With German industries already struggling with fierce competition from Asian markets, a shock stimulus to boost industrial competitiveness could undermine medium-term growth potential and exacerbate existing economic imbalances. Public Versus Private Lindner’s policy recommendations have taken broad swipes at the ruling government’s regulatory standards, advocating for a series of corporate tax cuts and the abolition of solidarity surcharges (Solidaritätszuschlag or Soli) on SMEs and freelance workers, all in the name of boosting innovation and competition. While the recommendations may appear well-intentioned, the former finance minister seems intent on sacrificing the public sector and marginalized groups. Taken together, these proposals reflect a steadfast rejection of German budgetary sustainability, which is crucial in the current economic climate. The assumption that corporate tax cuts, facilitated by reduced public services, will eventually pay for themselves through future growth is, to put it mildly, flawed. Not only do these policy measures threaten to undermine public services in the long term, but they also risk destabilizing inflationary pressures in the short term, leading to economic turmoil. No Turning Back Given the present conditions, one might assume that Germany needs to transition into economic nationalism to preserve the prospects of the Sonderweg and its political economy. Ex-Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s position paper asserts intergenerational injustice as a leading consequence of Germany’s economic downturn. However, the turmoil within the current German administration following the finance minister’s policy recommendations has overlooked the positive aspects of internationalism that have positioned post-war Germany as a global leader. Moreover, with mobility, migration, and international trade at the center of Germany’s political triangulations, the position paper’s failure to address outward mobility, diasporic contributions, and social values that disfavor trade protectionism as a decisive factor in social renewal to sustain the German Sonderweg presents an exclusionary narrative. This risks threatening Germany’s position as a major economic bulwark in the Global North. If anything, Germany’s national growth owes its enormous economic profitability to the international division of labor. Although the post-pandemic economic struggles affecting the German working class are no trivial matter, Germany’s emotionally charged political debates about the values of German work (Deutsche Arbeit) are unfair in spirit, pitting the country’s crisis consciousness against the depoliticization of socio-political institutions. Among Ordoliberals such as Lindner, there exists a perception of the economy as an isolated order, one where results are a direct outcome of influence on the systemic order rather than on the processes themselves. This enables the scope of economic short-termism, devoid of future sustainability. For now, Germany’s political uncertainty illustrates demands for minimal state interventionism to stabilize the economy in the long term. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the theoretical currents of such economic liberalism in post-pandemic Germany will translate into a classical problem of secondary deflation or create a decentralized competitive order that paves the way for institutional integrity toward social reunification.

Iran’s Regime Reacts To IAEA Resolution Against Its Nuclear Progr...	On November 21, 2024, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors adopted a resolution condemning Iran’s regime for its lack of cooperation with the agency and provide a comprehensive report on its nuclear activities. This resolution, proposed by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the United States, was approved with 19 votes in favor, 3 against, and 12 abstentions In an effort to prevent the adoption of the resolution, which could activate snapback sanctions, Iran’s mobilized all available lobbying resources. Despite these efforts, the major European powers ultimately introduced the resolution, which was then approved by the Board of Governors. According to The New York Times, Abbas Araghchi, the regime’s foreign minister, contacted officials from member states of the Board of Governors, including Brazil, South Africa, Bangladesh, Algeria, Burkina Faso, and Pakistan, asking them to oppose the resolution. Alongside Araghchi’s lobbying and pressuring of Board of Governors’ member states via phone calls from Tehran and efforts in Vienna, Iranian officials and media issued a series of threats during and after a visit by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi to Tehran, warning of severe retaliatory actions should a resolution be adopted. However, after the blow of the Board of Governors’ resolution, Iran’s Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organization issued a joint, fearful statement declaring their readiness for 'constructive engagement with relevant parties' in the 'development of a peaceful and indigenous nuclear program.' The weak joint statement claimed that the administration of Masoud Pezeshkian had prioritized continuing and enhancing cooperation with the IAEA since its inception to resolve outstanding issues. This stance contradicts earlier declarations by officials from these same institutions, who had stated that any resolution by the Board of Governors would signal the end of cooperation, mark the start of confrontation, and be intolerable. They had also threatened an immediate, severe, and 'regret-inducing' response if such a resolution were adopted. A state-affiliated media outlet, under the headline 'Iran Will Respond to the Counterproductive Actions of the Board of Governors,' wrote: '[Mohammad] Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, emphasized Iran’s cooperation with the IAEA but announced that if a resolution is adopted against Iran at the next IAEA meeting, Tehran will begin new nuclear measures even before the resolution’s adoption. Iran’s Foreign Minister also stressed this point in diplomatic terms.' Hassan Ghashghavi, the head of the nuclear committee of the regime’s Majlis (parliament), had explicitly stated before the resolution’s issuance: 'If a resolution is prepared against our country by the IAEA Board of Governors, we will undoubtedly and immediately take measures that will definitely be regret-inducing.' Following the weak joint statement by the Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organization, Kazem Gharibabadi, the regime’s deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs, issued an unconvincing threat, delaying the 'immediate and regret-inducing response' until after the snapback sanctions are reinstated. He stated: 'If they revert to the snapback mechanism and reinstate UN Security Council sanctions, the Islamic Republic will respond swiftly by withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).' More absurdly, Gharibabadi foolishly added: 'This is a decision that the state made several years ago and has officially communicated to them in writing.' (State television, November 21, 2024). Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, the former head of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Majlis, attributed the regime’s weak and anxious response to the resolution’s impact as follows: 'The IAEA resolution was the first sign of a harsh winter for Iran. Europe has aligned itself with Trump’s maximum pressure campaign. They are demanding the rollback of nuclear activities and programs and the increase of inspections without offering any concessions.' Reuters reported on the consequences of the IAEA Board of Governors’ resolution, stating that it compels the regime to cooperate with the IAEA. The Western powers behind the resolution intend to pressure the regime into negotiating new restrictions on its nuclear activities. However, it remains unclear whether the regime or its counterparts have the appetite or intention for another round of talks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EO6mFSNniVz8	2024-11-23T16:45:11-08:00	
Disparate Impact Is A Legal Trick – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya One of the most destructive fallacies of critical race theory is its insistence that racial disparities are caused by discrimination. The CRT premise is that any gap in racial attainment calls for an explanation, and—in the absence of any convincing explanation—they are compelled to conclude that such gaps are caused by discrimination. Many readers will be familiar with Thomas Sowell’s refutation of that argument. In arguing that disparities do not prove discrimination, Sowell challenges the premise that, in the absence of discrimination, we should expect all human beings to have equal life opportunities, experiences, and outcomes. In his book, Disparities and Discrimination Sowell 'argues that there is an underlying assumption that if discrimination was absent equality would prevail, which historically has been proven wrong.' It is wrong to expect equal attainment from human beings—people have different skills, abilities, and talents, so we would have no reason to expect that, if they are all given an 'equal' starting point, they would all exhibit uniform and equal levels of attainment. The gap between black and white The civil rights industry is founded on the debunked premise that disparities are prima facie evidence of discrimination. A large part of civil rights enforcement is now devoted to collecting statistics which will reveal attainment 'gaps.' These gaps are then treated as presumptive evidence of discrimination which, at the very least, will merit an investigation from what Lew Rockwell called 'the anti-discrimination police'—the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. Collecting data on race with a view to exposing attainment gaps is a well-funded industry. For example, in the context of educational attainment, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights had a budget of $178 million in 2024. Civil rights activists feel this is not enough to monitor all the gaps, and are requesting that the budget should be doubled: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States, and the 91 undersigned organizations, we urge you to double the funding for the U.S. Department of Education’s ('the department') Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to $280 million in your FY2025 request to Congress. The Leadership Conference appreciated the $178 million requested for FY2024; however, this vital office, central to the function of the department as a whole, has been sorely underfunded for far too long. The Civil Rights Data Collection office of the DOE aims 'to ensure CRDC data is an accurate and comprehensive depiction of student access to educational opportunities.' They also collect 'data on access to and enrollment in mathematics and science classes,' which can be used to demonstrate a racial 'gap' in children’s 'educational opportunities' in the sciences. Making an effort preemptively to avoid having statistics that reflect a racial gap can help schools avoid costly investigations from the anti-discrimination police. This explains why, to avoid their statistics showing a racial gap in mathematics, some schools have decreed that in 'antiracist math practice' there are no 'correct' answers to mathematical problems. That way all the children’s sums can be marked by teachers as correct and voila—no statistical gap! By this means they propose to eradicate 'inequity in math': Educators around the country have come out to condemn a ‘Dismantling Racism in Mathematics’ program which tells teachers not to push students to find the correct answers to math problems because doing so promotes white supremacy. The program is centered around a workbook for teachers entitled ‘A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction’ which asserts that America’s education system – even mathematics instruction – reinforces the dominant power structures of white colonizers. Legal tricks and statistical chicanery Attainment gaps incur legal penalties through what Rockwell terms 'a legal trick,' or what M. Lester O’Shea terms 'legal, statistical and verbal chicanery'—the concept of 'disparate impact.' This concept was invented by the Supreme Court of the United States in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971). According to the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, the aim of this concept is to safeguard black people from 'the repercussions of past discrimination': The disparate impact regulations seek to ensure that programs accepting federal money are not administered in a way that perpetuates the repercussions of past discrimination. As the Supreme Court has explained, even benignly-motivated policies that appear neutral on their face may be traceable to the nation’s long history of invidious race discrimination in employment, education, housing, and many other areas. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430–31 (1971); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 176–77 (1980); Gaston Cty. v. United States, 395 U.S. 285, 297 (1969). Unlike the concept of disparate treatment, which relates to how public institutions treat racial minorities, the concept of disparate impact focuses entirely on the effect on the 'victim.' As the DOJ adds, 'In a disparate impact case, the investigation focuses on the consequences of the recipient’s practices, rather than the recipient’s intent.' This is why civil rights activists highlight the role of data in revealing the impact of educational policies on black students. Rather than examining the curriculum or school attendance records, they can just check the gap between white and black performance—the gap is treated as evidence that the 'educational opportunities' are not 'meaningful' and 'Dr.' MLK-style dreams are then said not yet to be 'actualized': OCR’s enforcement, policy, technical assistance, and data responsibilities have considerable impact on whether or not students’ access to equal educational opportunities are meaningful and whether the rights of marginalized students to receive the supports and opportunities they deserve to achieve their dreams are actualized. The result of this trickery is that the civil rights framework does not require evidence of 'discrimination' in the sense most people understand that term. It relies on statistical gaps. The government has transformed power conferred upon it to eradicate 'discrimination' into a bureaucratic industry based on data showing statistical disparities between racial groups. The reason people do not object to this—despite Sowell’s work being widely known and despite cases of businesses driven to bankruptcy by racial discrimination claims based on nothing more than statistical chicanery—is that it is still socially unacceptable to be 'racist.' Caldwell observes that, 'The innovations of the 1960s had given progressives control over the most important levers of government, control that would endure for as long as the public was afraid of being called racist.' Caldwell shows that declaring civil rights enforcement to be 'unconstitutional,' far from resolving the dispute, merely restates the problem in different words. The problem is the contestation between the old de jure Constitution and the new de facto Civil Rights 'constitution.' Constitutional lawfare is, therefore, not able to resolve the essential danger that was correctly identified by Lew Rockwell in 1995: The Constitution has never stood in the way of civil rights enforcement. In the name of stamping out illegal discrimination, fundamental rights like freedom of association are denied daily… Politicians are promising to do something about it, but they have missed the larger point. Our troubles don’t stem from 'quotas,' 'set asides,' and the like; they stem from the presumption that government should be monitoring 'discrimination' in the first place. Pass all the anti-quota laws you want. Until anti-discrimination law is repealed, nothing can block the march of big government. About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

What Happens When China Puts Boots On The Ground In Myanmar? – An...	By David Hutt It now appears to be a question of 'when, not if' Chinese security personnel will arrive in Myanmar, with Beijing looking to secure its strategic interests in the war-torn country and those of its ally, the military junta that has lost large chunks of the country since the 2021 coup. The Irrawaddy online news outlet reported that the junta formed a 13-member working committee on October 22 to prepare the groundwork to establish a 'joint security company' with China. According to the report, the committee, chaired by Major-General Toe Yi, the junta’s deputy home affairs minister, is currently tasked with 'scrutinizing the importing and regulating of weapons and special equipment' until Beijing signs a drafted MOU on forming a 'security company.' After that, according to the narrative from Beijing and Naypyidaw, Chinese personnel would join a 'company' — more like a militia — alongside junta troops, which would be tasked with defending Chinese strategic and economic interests in the country. I’m told that China will send troops from the military and police in a 'private' capacity, giving the fiction of detachment. Yet this would not be a joint venture in anything but name. Does one seriously think that Chinese troops or police are going to listen to the Myanmar generals who have lost battle after battle to ethnic armies and ill-trained civilian militias over the past four years? Moreover, there is no reason to think that the China-junta 'militia' will stick to merely protecting Chinese nationals and Chinese-owned businesses in Myanmar. Chinese projects delayed It is true that Chinese assets have come under increased levels of attack from anti-junta forces in recent months. There is some logic, if you’re sitting in Beijing and Naypyidaw, in wanting to allow Chinese forces to help command most of northern Myanmar, giving junta forces a better chance of mopping up rebel forces elsewhere. The civil war has delayed key Chinese projects in the country, such as the long-planned China-Myanmar Economic Corridor between China’s Yunnan province and Myanmar’s Indian Ocean coast. Strategically key for Beijing is a port it wants to build in Rakhine state, allowing China to import oil and gas from the Middle East without ships needing to pass through the Malacca Strait, a potential chokepoint. This would be essential in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea, during which the Philippines or Taiwan could try to blockade Chinese trade, including oil and gas imports on which China’s economy depends. My sources say that the majority of the PLA contingent will be deployed to Rakhine state. According to statements released by Beijing, almost certainly intended to construct a peace narrative ahead of the deployment, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told junta leader Min Aung Hlaing in August that he hoped 'Myanmar will earnestly safeguard the safety of Chinese personnel and projects.' When Min Aung Hlaing visited China earlier this month, his first visit since the coup, Chinese Premier Li Qiang instructed him to 'take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese nationals, institutions, and projects in the country.' The reality, as Beijing knows well, is that the junta cannot ensure these things. That’s the entire reason why the 'security companies' are deemed necessary by the Chinese government. Offensive operations Once Chinese security personnel are on the ground in Myanmar, the fiction that they’re just standing guard outside a few industrial compounds or pipelines will become difficult to maintain. Indeed, they’re likely to have no choice but to mount offensive operations. The most obvious reason to expect this is that many Chinese-run enterprises are in territory currently controlled by resistance groups that will presumably need to be taken by Chinese forces. If not, why would Beijing make a u-turn on its existing policy, which had been to cajole and pay the ethnic militias to leave Chinese entities out of their fight with the junta? Secondly, after years of dallying, Beijing now clearly thinks that it cannot trust the anti-junta National Unity Government (NUG), presumably because it’s too pro-Western, nor most of the anti-junta ethnic militias – even those who have taken money from Beijing. Chinese authorities reportedly detained Peng Daxun, the leader of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), a militia that has inflicted heavy casualties on the junta, after he was summoned to Yunnan for a parlay last month. This may be a temporary detention pour encourager les autres, or it may be Beijing trying to dismantle disloyal militias more permanently. Yet, in essence, Beijing has now thrown its weight behind the junta because it presumably believes China’s interests would be best served by an outright junta victory. So if Beijing thinks the ultimate way of protecting Chinese business interests in Myanmar, for now and in the long term, is for the civil war to be ended and for junta forces to win the conflict decisively, the difference between Chinese security personnel conducting defensive and offensive operations is paper thin. Why wouldn’t Beijing use its troops to bring about its overarching goal? Why would Beijing overlook the opportunity to end a civil war that it wants over? Anti-China sentiment Why would Beijing merely send personnel to defend Chinese factories and pipelines for a few months or years if it thinks there is the possibility that forces hostile to Chinese interests could eventually take power nationally? Under these circumstances, Chinese personnel would think it justified, under the narrative of 'safeguarding the safety of Chinese nationals, institutions and projects in the country,' to wage offensive assaults against anti-junta forces across Myanmar. Granted, the junta is touchy about being seen as a lackey of Beijing — or about Myanmar becoming a protectorate of China. That is why Beijing has offered platitudes of a joint 'security company,' a fiction to get around Myanmar’s constitution that forbids the deployment of foreign troops. But what position will the junta be in to dictate what Chinese personnel can do or where they can go once they are in Myanmar? Lastly, does one imagine that anti-junta forces won’t retaliate against Chinese intervention, especially when that intervention is so clearly on behalf of the regime? Anti-China sentiment is running high in Myanmar and will boil over once Chinese troops and police step foot in the country. One can very easily imagine an escalating campaign of attacks by anti-junta forces on Chinese interests – increasing the incentives for Chinese security personnel to launch offensive operations. Once Chinese boots are on the ground in Myanmar, this means direct intervention by China – not merely an economic peacekeeping effort by joint 'security companies.' And Chinese personnel will have to conduct offensive operations – not just stand guard at Chinese-run factories and pipelines.

Abkhazia: Lots Of Drama Unlikely To Produce Change	By Irakli Machaidze (Eurasianet) -- A political crisis in the Russian-dominated, separatist entity of Abkhazia has been defused, but the underlying issue that prompted the unrest – legislation that would grant Russians favorable real estate investment privileges – remains unaddressed. In the end, Russia, the territory’s financial sponsor, is likely to end up getting what it wants. Opponents of the legislative measure to grant Russians insider access to real estate and other investment opportunities occupied the de-facto government’s offices in the Abkhaz capital Sokhumi on November 15, aiming to block passage of the bill. After a more than four-day standoff, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic, Aslan Bzhania, announced his resignation. In return, the protesters ended their occupation of government buildings, and an early election for the leadership of the territory, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s amid a civil conflict, was announced. Abkhazia’s de facto parliament has approved Bzhania’s resignation and on November 21 was still debating on a date for a snap election. The drama may end up being a case of much ado about nothing. Bzhania, who appears to retain Russia’s backing, has already announced his intention to run again. It remains unclear who opposition leaders will nominate as their candidate, or if they will opt to unify around a single candidate. The controversial Russian investment bill that was to have been debated and, likely, finalized on November 15, remains on the table, its fate uncertain. The agreement that defused the political crisis between the de facto government and its opposition did not address the fate of the bill. The Kremlin is unlikely to alter its intentions to dominate Abkhazia’s real estate market, even if Bzhania opponents come to power. According to sources in the Russian government, Moscow does not view Bzhania critics as opponents of the Kremlin’s wishes, the independent news outlet Vyorstka (Вёрстка) reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on November 18 emphasized Russia’s support for the swift normalization of the situation in Abkhazia, expressing hope it would remain within constitutional boundaries. When asked about the impact of the protests on bilateral relations, Peskov affirmed that ties with Abkhazia are 'a very important priority of our foreign policy.'

Poland: Warsaw Mayor Runs For President As Ruling Party’s Candida...	By Aleksandra Krzysztoszek (EurActiv) -- The Warsaw mayor won his party's primaries and will run to be the Polish president as the candidate of Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition (KO, EPP) alliance. In the primaries held on Friday (22 November), Rafał Trzaskowski beat foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, by wining 75% of the votes. 'I know that the winner will go to the elections with full determination,' Prime Minister and KO leader Donald Tusk said, announcing the outcome. Praised by his supporters for his skills and knowledge of foreign languages, Trzaskowski served as minister of digital affairs in the previous Tusk government between 2013 and 2014. He then became mayor of Warsaw in 2018 and was re-elected to the post in 2023. Trzaskowski thanked his voters and pointed out that KO had decided to hold primaries 'as a truly democratic party,' unlike the main opposition PiS (ECR), where party leader Jarosław Kaczyński has the final say. 'In PiS, just one voice counts. Here, every vote counts,' he said. Sikorski thanked his rival for a 'chivalrous competition' and praised his idea of organising primaries. He also called on those who voted for him to support Trzaskowski 'unconditionally' in the elections. 'Rafał, fight, fight, fight and win!' he told Trzaskowski. Trzaskowski is the clear favourite in the elections. According to the latest polls, he is likely to win no matter who the PiS nominates as its candidate. PiS to name its candidate on Sunday Incumbent Polish President Andrzej Duda is finishing his second term as president, the constitution stops him from running for another term. As a result, the PiS is looking for a new candidate, which it will announce as early as Sunday (24 November), according to party sources. The same sources suggest Karol Nawrocki, former head of the Institute of National Remembrance, will be the most likely contender. Other names that could be in the running include controversial former education minister, Przemysław Czarnek, MEP Tobiasz Bocheński, and former prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Mateusz Morawiecki is the least likely candidate for the PiS presidential nomination, as his tenure as prime minister may weigh against him. He has also expressed interest in the ECR leadership, currently held by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (FdI, ECR). After the party lost power in Poland, because of the 2023 parliamentary election, from PiS's perspective, keeping the presidency is crucial, as it would allow the party to maintain influence over the government and veto legislation. For the same reason, it is essential for Tusk's ruling coalition to win since it would no longer have to deal with presidents who veto laws and hamper the implementation of his party's policies. These include restoring judicial independence, which is key for Poland to receive further EU recovery funds. While the ruling coalition initially considered nominating a single candidate for president, at the end of the day, each party decided to run a separate candidate. Last week, parliamentary speaker and head of the Poland 2050 party (Renew), Szymon Hołownia, announced his bid. The Left (S&D) is going to name their candidate soon. The opposition Confederation (PfE/ESN) party nominated its co-leader, Sławomir Mentzen. The date of the elections has not been scheduled yet, but they will be held around spring of 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1ECldmmbkFqPY	2024-11-23T16:23:24-08:00	
MSMEs In ASEAN: Addressing The Financing Gap – OpEd	Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the life blood of ASEAN's economy. They make up for over 97% of all businesses, provide nearly 70% of employment, and contribute around 40% to the region's GDP. These businesses could be big or small - they could be the street-side food vendors in Bangkok, the family-owned coffee processors in Vietnam, and the tech startups emerging in Singapore's bustling ecosystem. Yet, despite playing a critical role in driving growth and innovation, they face a persistent, almost enigmatic problem: financing. Governments, banks, and even fintech platforms are pouring in funds to address this gap. Hence one would assume that it would be much easier for MSMEs to access the funds they need. But it may not be true. As per a report by ADB, there is a significant financing gap across ASEAN that exceeds a staggering $300 billion annually. It leaves many asking: Why, after so many initiatives and so much support, do MSMEs continue to struggle for financing? Governments of ASEAN member states are making strategic moves to tackle this issue. An example would be Indonesia's recent loan forgiveness program. The initiative was just recently launched in November 2024, which allows MSMEs with debts under 500 million Indonesian rupiah to clear their bad loans with state banks. The aim is to have over three million of these businesses get a fresh start and a second chance to succeed. On the private sector front, financial giants, HSBC, unveiled a $1 billion ASEAN Growth Fund which would also support MSMEs desiring to scale up digital platform businesses. Although the idea is simple, it is transformative. The initiative will empower MSMEs to embrace technology and thrive in the digital economy. Fintech platforms have got a head start and are rewriting the rules of MSME financing. Funding Societies is one of Southeast Asia’s largest MSME digital finance platform and it has already disbursed over $3 billion in loans. Partnerships with traditional banks are further amplifying this impact. Maybank is one of the large banks in southeast Asia that has recently invested in the platform and has commended the fintech firm for bridging the financing gap. The rise of digital lending and crowdfunding platforms has helped MSMEs immensely as now they can now bypass the cumbersome paperwork and collateral requirements of traditional loans. Yet, even with all these new developments in the finance landscape, many MSMEs are still deprived of the finances they so badly need to both start and grow their businesses. When starting an enterprise, MSMEs are unable to provide adequate collateral or formal financial records needed for securing loans from banks. Historically banks perceive MSMEs as high risk, which limits MSMEs access to resources. Fragmented regulatory environment across ASEAN further complicates the situation. Each country in the ASEAN region has its own definitions and rules for MSMEs and this creates unnecessary hurdles for regional financing initiatives. This lack of consistency often makes it challenging for cross-border financiers to introduce uniform lending products. Some MSMEs, despite running their businesses successfully for over a decade, are repeatedly denied loans just because they are unable to provide formal collateral. Banks often need land deeds or large deposits as collateral making it even harder for the MSMEs. Without access to formal financing, they often turn to informal lending where the interest could be exorbitant. Some MSME report that they are charged 2% to as high as 20% per month as interest from these informal lending channels. Without proper financing MSMEs cannot grow and the alternatives too are exploitative. These highlight the glaring mismatch between what MSMEs need and what is currently available. Indeed, the government programs and fintech platforms have made progress but there’s still a long way to go. Policymakers and financial institutions must rethink their strategies and address the root causes of these challenges. One immediate solution could be to develop a centralized credit database for ASEAN. Such a system would aggregate and share MSME credit information from across the region, thus, making it easier for banks and fintech platforms to assess risk and provide loans confidently. Harmonizing MSME definitions and regulations across ASEAN through a standardized framework would simplify cross-border financing and make regional initiatives more effective. Financial literacy programs tailored for MSMEs provide small business owners the much-needed guidance on managing finances and effectively using digital tools. Singapore’s SkillsFuture program and Malaysia’s SMECorp serve as strong examples of how targeted training can empower small business owners. ASEAN’s digital economy is projected to grow to $1 trillion by 2030 and this offers immense opportunities for MSMEs to integrate and thrive. MSMEs are the backbone of ASEAN economies. Although these businesses are small, their impact on economies and societies is massive. Hence the effort should be to not just to close the financing gap but to unlock the full potential of MSMEs as drivers of inclusive and sustainable growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EBWSpE5FfLrj	2024-11-23T16:21:11-08:00	
Robert Reich: GM, Corporate Greed, And The Reason The Democrats L...	At the same time Democrats and progressives are justifiably enraged at Trump’s gonzo Cabinet picks, they’re all but mute about corporate America’s continued siphoning of economic gains to the top. Yet this siphoning has created the stagnant wages and insecure jobs that helped propel Trump into the presidency and give Republicans control over both chambers of Congress. Trump at least gave workers an explanation for what’s happened to them — although it was a lie: It isn’t undocumented immigrants or the 'deep state' or transgender kids or any other Trump bogeyman. It’s corporate greed. The most recent example: On Friday, GM announced it was laying off 1,000 workers. These layoffs followed another round of GM layoffs in August, which saw 1,500 jobs cut. The cuts affected both salaried and hourly staff, including some United Auto Workers members. Most of the workers being laid off Friday were notified via email early Friday morning. Some had been working for GM for over thirty years. GM says it has no choice. It must cut costs. This is what we hear again and again from corporate America. We’ll be hearing even more of this as Artificial Intelligence takes over white-collar as well as blue-collar jobs. No choice? GM is on track for making record profits this year, surpassing its 2022 record profit of $14.5 billion. In the third quarter of 2024 alone, GM made $3.4 billion. That’s a $200 million increase from the same period last year. GM CEO Mary Barra’s compensation for 2024 is $27.8 million. This includes a base salary of $2.1 million, stock awards of $14.6 million, stock option awards valued at $4.9 million, an 'incentive plan' compensation (as if she needed more incentive) of $5.3 million, other payment of $997,392, and perks (personal travel, security, financial counseling, company vehicles, and an executive health plan) valued at $389,005. The ratio of Barra’s compensation to that of the typical GM employee is estimated to be 303-to-1. In June, GM announced $6 billion in stock buybacks. This means $6 billion of GM’s record profits will be used to purchase its own shares of stock — thereby boosting share prices (and the portion of Barra’s compensation in stock grants and options) simply because fewer shares of GM stock will be in circulation. Keep in mind that the richest 1 percent of American hold over half of the value of all shares of stock held by Americans, and the richest 10 percent hold 92 percent. So, in fact, GM’s savings from axing 1,000 jobs will be transferred into the pockets of wealthy Americans (including GM’s CEO). Why aren’t Democrats up in arms about this? I haven’t heard Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, or any other leading Democrat say a critical word about GM’s latest move. Why isn’t Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer — who may be in the running for president in 2028 (assuming we have another election) — accusing GM of sacrificing jobs for profits that are siphoned off to big investors? Why aren’t Democrats, who still control the Senate and presidency, moving more aggressively to outlaw stock buybacks — which were considered illegal stock manipulations before Ronald Reagan’s SEC gave them the green light? Why aren’t they demanding that capital gains taxes be increased on the super-wealthy, whose stock gains this year alone have made America’s billionaires 30 percent richer? Why aren’t they moving to increase corporate taxes on corporations whose ratio of CEO pay to their median workers is more than 50 to 1? And impose even higher taxes if the ratio exceeds 100 to 1? (Senate Budget Committee Chair Sheldon Whitehouse, along with Representatives Barbara Lee and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have introduced just such a bill, but no one knows about it. Why isn’t the Democratic leadership loudly pushing this?) The lesson of the debacle of the 2024 election is that big corporations and the wealthy have shafted average working Americans, whose wages and jobs have gone nowhere for decades and who are understandably frustrated and angry at what they see as a rigged system. But Democrats have offered no alternative explanation for what’s happened to average working people or agenda for remedying it. Trump's baseless explanation and agenda are the only ones available. So it’s no surprise that many working Americans voted for Trump on Election Day. Now Trump and his Republican stooges think they’ve been given a license to blow the system up — initially by appointing a bunch of clowns, conspiracy theorists, and sexual predators to key posts. It’s important to rail against Trump’s appointments. But unless we attack the sources of the outrage Trump has tapped into, working Americans will continue to go along with whatever Trump and his lapdogs want to do.

Zelenskyy Says Putin Aiming To Regain Kursk Territory Before Trum...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia is seeking to drive his forces out of the Kursk region before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year but added that the military situation in the Donetsk region is the most critical for his country. 'I am certain that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to push us out before January 20,' Zelenskiy told reporters, referring to the day of Trump’s inauguration. 'It is very important for him to show that he controls the situation' in Kursk. Ukraine stunned the Kremlin by sweeping into the Kursk region in August, seizing nearly 1,400 square kilometers of Russian territory. With Trump promising to end the war upon entering office, Moscow could be forced to exchange land it seized in Ukraine for Kursk territory should it fail to push Ukrainian forces out in time. Putin has sent tens of thousands of Russian troops to Kursk who are mounting wave after wave of counterattacks, a source on Ukraine's General Staff said. Russia has regained about 800 square kilometers in Kursk or about 40 percent of the territory Ukraine seized, the source said. Zelenskiy said that Ukrainian troops are inflicting large-scale losses on Russian forces in Kursk. Russia has recently been losing as many as 1,500 troops a day to injury and death across the entire theater of the war, the most since the invasion began in February 2022, Ukrainian and Western officials said. 'Russia hasn’t suffered such losses as it is now suffering in Kursk,' Zelenskiy said. Russia has recruited more than 11,000 North Korean troops to help it take back Kursk territory. The North Korean troops reportedly arrived last month though it is unclear if they have taken part in fighting yet. The United States and the United Kingdom reportedly gave permission this week to Ukraine to strike inside Russia with ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles respectively. The missiles are precision, tactical weapons designed to hit command-and-control centers, logistics and arms depots near the front. Ukraine has already used the missiles to strike in Kursk and the neighboring region of Belgorod. Russian Advances Meanwhile, Russian ground forces continue to make incremental advances in eastern Ukraine, including near the town of Velyka Novosilka, according to Deep State, an open-source organization with ties to the Ukrainian Army, and confirmed by other analysts. Ukraine has been struggling to hold back the Russian advances due to a lack of manpower, raising concern about a possible breakthrough. While Russia is losing forces at a greater rate, the Kremlin is able to quickly replace them thanks to lucrative wages and incentives. Putin on November 23 widened those incentives, signing a law permitting the cancellation of debt for new army recruits volunteering to fight in Ukraine. The new law allows the state to forgive up to 10 million rubles ($95,835) of debt for those signing contracts with the Defense Ministry to fight in Ukraine for at least a year, beginning on December 1. The law applies to all potential recruits who have had debt collection proceedings opened against them before December 1. The maximum debt forgiveness is several times the average annual salary in Russia’s provinces. Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, said in an interview published on November 23 that new technological advances will prevent a 'serious breakthrough' at the front. Ukraine and Russia have been rapidly developing reconnaissance and strike drones as well as electronic warfare weapons. The technology advancements have helped Ukraine partially compensate for its lack of manpower. In the interview, Zaluzhniy said that Russia will struggle to expand the front line and break through because it would require huge resources 'which the Russians no longer have.' Trump Presidency U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his counterparts from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized nations outside Rome on November 25-26 to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will be the last G7 meeting for the Biden administration, which is seeking to ensure that support for Ukraine is sustained when Trump enters office in January. Trump has criticized aid to Ukraine, raising questions whether he will continue support should a peace deal not be reached. The president-elect met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Florida on November 22 to discuss Ukraine and other issues facing the alliance. Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly considering Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, for the new post of special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Zelenskiy told reporters that the war could end next year if Ukraine continues to get strong Western support. Zelenskiy spoke with media following the Grain From Ukraine Summit in Kyiv. Ukraine is one of the largest exporters of grains to world markets. Prior to the conference, Zelenskiy visited a memorial to the victims of the Holodomor, the man-made famine orchestrated by the Soviet government in the 1930s that led to the deaths of millions of Ukrainians. In a clear reference to Putin’s war against Ukraine, Zelenskiy said: 'There is something we know for certain. They wanted to destroy us. To kill us. To subjugate us. They failed.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EHU1m4isyQp_	2024-11-23T16:17:18-08:00	
How The West Prospers As The Rest Drown – OpEd	By Hafed Al-Ghwell Global financial systems are metaphorically connected vessels, in which the policies of one country can create ripples felt by another. Recently, a troubling phenomenon has emerged: Wealthier Western economies, in their bid to tame inflation — often driven by corporate greed or 'greedflation' — are adopting high interest rates. This seemingly domestic monetary policy has severe reverberations for the Global South’s poorer economies, precipitating a sovereign debt crisis of unprecedented scale.In their quest to tame domestic inflation, Western central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, often resort to hiking interest rates, a strategy that, while stabilizing their own economies, wreaks havoc on poorer nations. This policy tightens domestic credit but has dire global ramifications, particularly for emerging economies saddled with substantial dollar-denominated debt. As these rates climb, so do the costs of borrowing, making debt repayment increasingly untenable. For example, following the interest rate increases in 2022, many developing countries faced ballooning debt servicing costs alongside severe currency depreciation.These nations end up caught in a vicious cycle: They must allocate more of their scarce resources to debt repayment while their currencies weaken, further inflating their debt burden. The situation echoes the debt crises of the 1980s — often referred to as the 'Volcker shock' — that crippled Latin America and Africa, but now with the additional burden of complex, commercially sourced debt, leading to prolonged economic stagnation and deepening inequalities.The Global South’s debt crisis is not merely a financial predicament but a consequence of deeply entrenched imbalances in the global economic order. As Western nations, such as the US and the UK, enjoy the privilege of issuing debt in their own currencies, countries like Zambia and Sri Lanka are forced to borrow in foreign currencies, often at exorbitant interest rates. This structural disparity means that, while rich countries can manage high debt-to-gross domestic product ratios without existential threat — Japan’s stands at 254 percent — poorer economies buckle under far lower ratios.The result is a drain on their national budgets, diverting funds away from essential sectors like healthcare, education and infrastructure. For instance, Zambia’s external debt ballooned to $12.5 billion by 2021, driven partly by illicit financial flows and loss of export revenues to foreign investors. These dynamics lock these nations in a vicious cycle, with the burden of debt service stifling economic growth and perpetuating poverty, effectively allowing the Global North to outsource economic hardship to already-struggling economies. The question then becomes not just one of immediate debt relief, but of rethinking a flawed multilateral system that continuously disadvantages the Global South.Beyond the surface threats of potential default and sluggish growth, the relentless escalation of debt repayments forces poorer nations into austerity traps, decimating their socioeconomic fabric. Austerity measures, often mandated by international creditors like the International Monetary Fund, primarily hurt the disadvantaged, skewing income distribution by shifting benefits to the top 10 percent, while impoverishing the bottom 80 percent. The austerity cycle leads to stagnant or declining real wages and mounting unemployment, pressuring local labor markets to compromise on pay, worsening existing inequalities. This creates fertile ground for socioeconomic instability, directly impeding human capital development and long-term economic prospects. International financial structures, skewed toward creditor interests, thus perpetuate a cycle in which the Global South is structurally disadvantaged, effectively condemning it to tread water in a sea of debt as wealthier nations consolidate their prosperity.The disparity in global economic policy, with Western economies vigorously combating inflation through aggressive monetary policies, heavily burdens the Global South. As interest rates rise in the Global North, debt servicing costs for poorer nations soar, exacerbating their financial woes and precipitating potential defaults. High inflation and modest global growth compound these challenges, pushing 15 percent of poor countries into debt distress and leaving half on the brink.This is not merely about domestic stability, it also highlights an alarming neglect of the broader international economic repercussions. Such policies significantly strain global economic health, fostering inequality as these nations grapple with austerity measures, deteriorating socioeconomic conditions and hindered long-term recovery. This cyclical debt enmeshment prevents the Global South from achieving sustainable development, while rich nations consolidate their prosperity, laying bare a systemic financial inequity that threatens global stability.It is this precise dynamic that epitomizes how the West prospers as the rest drown. As wealthier nations move to protect their markets and labor forces, poorer countries continue to bear the brunt. An ensuing cycle of debt and dependency effectively ensures that, while the Global North establishes a semblance of economic order, the Global South remains ensnared in a web of borrowing and austerity. In recent years, the inevitable widening gap between the West and the rest of the world has become unsustainable.A comprehensive overhaul of international debt policies is long overdue. The current case-by-case basis of the G20 Common Framework is ineffective, failing to offer the predictability necessary for substantial debt relief. A more systematic approach is essential, one that includes a multilateral sovereign debt restructuring mechanism. This would facilitate fair and equitable treatment across all creditors, ensuring that countries can prioritize investments in green growth and climate resilience without being shackled by debilitating debt service obligations.Moreover, to address the urgency driven by climate priorities that have languished under underfunded commitments, a dual-pillar approach is necessary. Countries with dire debt situations require comprehensive restructuring involving all forms of international creditors — private, bilateral and multilateral. This should be reminiscent of the large-scale debt relief initiatives of the early 2000s, adapted to the current needs of climate and development investments. For less-indebted nations, enhancing credit and providing debt suspension through multilateral institutions could offer more fiscal space and reduced capital costs, enabling them to meet climate and development goals more effectively.Simultaneously, geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism pose significant risks to global cooperation. Multilateral dialogue between major global powers like the US and China is crucial to navigating these geopolitical frictions. Additionally, fostering a supportive environment for affordable lending from multilateral development banks and new issuances of special drawing rights can provide the necessary liquidity for emerging markets.Such innovative, equitable solutions are imperative — not only to address the financial disparities exacerbated by climate disasters but also to stave off the social instability that unchecked debt crises are bound to trigger. Thus, an urgent, holistic and collaborative strategy is essential for a truly balanced global economic order, before the West ultimately drowns the rest.

Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2024: Redefining BJP’s Alliance Dy...	The assembly election results for Maharashtra and Jharkhand have been announced, highlighting a pivotal development in Indian politics. Maharashtra’s results have attracted significant attention because of its critical role in national politics, despite both states having their own political significance. Maharashtra, the second-largest state in India by population and political influence, has 48 Lok Sabha seats, positioning it as a key player in the national political landscape. The state’s role in the recent general elections, conducted six months ago, is crucial, particularly as the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, encountered a notable setback. The BJP, despite being the ruling alliance in Maharashtra, managed to secure only 17 Lok Sabha seats, indicating a disappointing performance for a party that excelled nationally. Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh significantly contributed to the Congress and its allies' performance in the general elections, reflecting a broader trend. The general election results in Maharashtra provided a rare moment of hope, despite Congress’ national defeat. Rahul Gandhi characterized the party's robust performance in the state as indicative of a resurgence, enhancing optimism for the upcoming assembly elections. Congress and its allies sought to replicate their success, driven by confidence in their momentum.The assembly elections represented a crucial opportunity for the BJP to regain its standing. The party underwent a thorough introspection and strategic overhaul, re-energizing its cadre and revamping its campaign. This led to a focused three-month effort aimed at regaining Maharashtra’s trust through an aggressive campaign blitz. However, the recent assembly election results are not just about the balance of power in Maharashtra but also reflect the evolving political dynamics in India. They signify whether the BJP’s corrective measures have borne fruit or if Congress and its allies have managed to consolidate their gains from the general elections. The outcome of these elections will undoubtedly set the tone for future political strategies and alliances, not only in Maharashtra but across the nation. As the analysis of today’s results concludes, Maharashtra’s political importance is clearly reaffirmed. The BJP has secured 132 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena has added 57, and the NCP has claimed 41. This results in a total of 230 seats for the BJP-led NDA, highlighting the state's significance as an indicator of changing political dynamics in India. BJP's Course Correction and Historic Victory in Maharashtra Elections: Key Factors The BJP-led alliance’s success in the Maharashtra assembly elections was a testament to its strategic recalibration and ground-level mobilization. A combination of organizational unity, grassroots outreach, policy-driven engagement, and strategic leadership turned the tide in its favor. Below are the key factors that underpinned this victory: 1. Flawless Coordination Among Alliance Partners The BJP-led alliance, which includes the BJP, Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction), and the Ajit Pawar faction of the NCP, demonstrated effective coordination. This alliance effectively addressed seat-sharing and other contentious issues, unlike their opposition counterparts. Their unified stance provided a notable advantage, as even BJP candidates entered constituencies typically assigned to their allies without undermining the alliance’s unity. The Congress-led coalition experienced significant internal discord. The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP are in conflict regarding seat-sharing arrangements, resulting in public disputes. The disunity among opposition forces created confusion and mistrust among voters, resulting in a distinct advantage for the BJP. 2. RSS Cadre: The Backbone of BJP's Ground Campaign The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) played a pivotal role in mobilizing voters at the grassroots level. The BJP's strength lay in its ability to organize large rallies and mega-events; however, it was the RSS's detailed door-to-door campaigning that proved decisive. The RSS launched a targeted voter outreach program focusing on specific demographics, including the elderly and differently-abled individuals. The campaign effectively mobilized voters over 80 and those with disabilities, resulting in high voter turnout. The RSS conducted more than 60,000 statewide public meetings, establishing a direct link with voters. The meetings focused on local grievances, clarified the alliance’s vision, and established a strong support base. This extensive ground network provides a significant competitive advantage, as no other party in India has a similar organizational structure capable of influencing voters at such a detailed level. 3. Policy Implementation and Welfare Schemes The BJP effectively communicated its success in welfare policies, which appealed to voters. Initiatives aimed at women, including financial incentives, subsidized gas cylinders, and education programs, resonated with female voters, a key demographic in this election. The revision of Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and enhanced market access have been advantageous for farmers. Party workers closely observed the implementation of these programs, confirming that beneficiaries received their entitlements. The hands-on approach strengthened voter confidence in the BJP's dedication to governance. 4. Polarization and Strategic Leadership The strategic involvement of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was a key factor in BJP’s success, as his rallies effectively mobilized the Hindu voter base. The slogan 'Batoge to Katoge' (division leads to defeat) effectively polarized Hindu voters in support of the BJP. This message challenged the BJP’s characterization of 'vote jihad,' a term used to describe the alleged strategic voting behaviors of Muslim voters opposing the party. The opposition’s effort to consolidate Muslim votes and launching caste-based census agenda against the BJP proved ineffective in polarized constituencies, leading to a significant mobilization of Hindu voters in support of the BJP. The BJP’s campaign leveraged this dynamic, strengthening its support base. 5. Youth Engagement and Digital Campaigns BJP launched focused digital campaigns on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and WhatsApp to engage first-time voters. The campaigns emphasized job creation, development initiatives, and nationalist sentiments, targeting the aspirations of younger voters. The party's local leadership engaged with student unions and youth organizations, positioning the BJP as a party of growth and opportunity. This outreach reinforced their dominance in a key demographic. 6. Charismatic Leadership and Star Campaigners Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rallies played a crucial role in the campaign, emphasizing the BJP’s focus on development and national pride. His speeches attracted large audiences, generating momentum that resulted in votes. Devendra Fadnavis and Eknath Shinde were instrumental in localizing the campaign, focusing on regional issues, and effectively countering opposition narratives. The BJP effectively addressed macro-level issues and micro-level voter concerns, resulting in a turnaround that solidified its dominance in the state. Also, this victory reinforces BJP’s state-level dominance and boosts the party’s morale as it prepares for future challenges in the national political arena. Strengthening BJP’s Agenda Amidst a Fragmented Opposition The BJP’s lack of a full majority in the Lok Sabha necessitates reliance on ally support to progress its legislative agenda. A Congress win in Maharashtra would have bolstered the opposition, especially the I.N.D.I.A. Alliance, enhancing their ability to challenge BJP policies nationally.Maharashtra, being India’s second-largest state, holds significant political influence. The defeat of Congress undermines its momentum, hindering its ability to effectively challenge the BJP at the national level. Success in Maharashtra would have enabled Congress to more effectively challenge BJP’s policies, encompassing economic reforms and social issues. Now, the weakened position of Congress allows the BJP to strengthen its dominance within the NDA, thereby increasing its parliamentary power. The weakened and divided position of the Congress undermines the integrity of the INDIA Alliance, diminishing its effectiveness as a cohesive opposition to the BJP. The discord among Congress’s allies in Maharashtra, particularly between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena faction and Sharad Pawar’s NCP faction, has highlighted the alliance’s weaknesses. The BJP-led NDA Alliance is expected to strengthen by capitalizing on the opportunity to attract dissatisfied leaders from opposition parties. The results in Maharashtra will strengthen the BJP's strategy for other states, reducing the INDIA Alliance's overall influence ahead of the upcoming general elections. The discord within the NCP following the elections may lead to additional defections to the BJP, thereby strengthening its influence in Maharashtra and diminishing the opposition's morale on a national level. Increased Rajya Sabha Influence for BJP The Congress defeat in Maharashtra has notable long-term implications for the Rajya Sabha elections. Maharashtra contributes 19 members to the Rajya Sabha, highlighting its significance in shaping the upper house of Parliament. Congress, along with its allies Shiv Sena and NCP, has historically maintained influence in Rajya Sabha, attributed to their dominance at the state level. Their defeat in Maharashtra limits their capacity to obtain sufficient seats in the state assembly for nominating members to the Rajya Sabha. Opposition leaders from these parties are likely to face challenges in accessing Parliament’s upper house. Conversely, the BJP, traditionally weaker in the Rajya Sabha than in the Lok Sabha, is poised for substantial gains. The BJP's enhanced majority in Maharashtra enables it to secure Rajya Sabha seats for its candidates, thereby strengthening its legislative power. The loss of Congress enhances BJP’s capacity to advance its legislative goals while simultaneously undermining the opposition's attempts at unity. This victory represents a crucial advancement for the BJP in preparation for the 2024 general elections, while Congress and its allies must confront the challenge of reorganizing and developing new strategies following their electoral defeat. The BJP’s Electoral Mandate Redefines Alliance Dynamics in Maharashtra The BJP’s victory in Maharashtra has altered the power dynamics within its alliance, especially concerning the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) and the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction). The BJP’s current strengthened mandate enables it to assertively claim the Chief Minister’s position, a role it has traditionally relinquished to allies, despite its electoral advantages in past alliances where concessions were made for coalition stability. Key Historical Context 2014 Elections: In the 2014 Elections, the BJP secured 122 seats, making it the single largest party, yet it did not achieve a majority. The government was formed with Shiv Sena, granting substantial portfolios despite existing tensions. 2019 Elections: In the 2019 elections, the BJP formed an alliance with Shiv Sena, achieving a majority. However, the alliance disintegrated due to Shiv Sena's insistence on the Chief Minister's position. Uddhav Thackeray formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in alliance with Congress and NCP. 2022 Elections: 2022 Political Shift: Eknath Shinde's rebellion led to the split of Shiv Sena, resulting in BJP appointing Shinde as Chief Minister while retaining a junior partner role in state leadership to ensure alliance stability. Post-2024 Election Dynamics The 2024 assembly elections represent a crucial juncture for BJP in Maharashtra, significantly altering the dynamics of political alliances. 1. Shiv Sena (Shinde Faction): Eknath Shinde’s faction, currently in the Chief Minister’s position, faces considerable pressure to transfer authority to the BJP. The faction's dependence on BJP's organizational and electoral strength has increased due to declining public support and internal divisions. The BJP’s vote share exceeds that of its allies combined, indicating a clear power imbalance within the alliance. 2. NCP (Ajit Pawar Faction): The NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar has diminished bargaining power due to a lackluster electoral performance. The emphasis will likely transition to maintaining essential portfolios instead of challenging the BJP's assertion of leadership. This change in alliance dynamics enables the BJP to not only attain the Chief Minister’s position but also to reinforce its dominance in Maharashtra’s political arena, thereby enhancing its influence at both state and national levels. Why BJP Will Push for Chief Ministership Reflecting Electoral Mandate: The BJP’s dominance in the alliance and its claim to the Chief Minister’s position aligns with voter preferences, thereby reinforcing the party’s brand in Maharashtra. Learning from Past Errors: The BJP has recognized the implications of the 2019 setback, where yielding the Chief Minister’s position to Shiv Sena resulted in the loss of government control. The BJP aims to avoid compromises that could lead to defections or internal power struggles within the alliance. Expanding Organizational Control: A BJP Chief Minister enables the party to strengthen its grassroots network and exert greater influence over state-level policies, especially in anticipation of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Precedents and Public Sentiment The BJP has consistently highlighted its focus on stable governance and decisive leadership, appealing to the electorate. Core voters in Maharashtra have previously shown dissatisfaction regarding concessions granted to allies. BJP's claim to the Chief Minister’s office meets its base's expectations and enhances accountability. BJP’s pursuit of the Chief Minister’s position appears assured, yet effectively handling ally expectations will be crucial. The party must provide strategic portfolios to its allies to sustain alliance unity while asserting its leadership position. BJP in Bihar effectively managed its alliances until the coalition structure collapsed. BJP is expected to take a pragmatic approach in Maharashtra by rewarding its allies and maintaining its leadership position. Conclusions The Maharashtra elections have altered the BJP’s position within its alliance. The party, backed by a strong electoral mandate and insights from previous compromises, is set to regain the Chief Minister’s position. This move would strengthen BJP’s control in Maharashtra and enhance its leadership role within the alliance. BJP's strong performance in key assembly by-elections in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan highlight its increasing momentum across various regions. The party experienced a setback in Jharkhand; however, the small state’s limited political significance is unlikely to hinder BJP’s resurgence. These outcomes reinforce BJP’s narrative of governance and organizational strength, establishing it as a significant contender for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. BJP is establishing itself as a leader in state and national politics, reinforcing its position as a central pillar in Indian political dynamics.

China Should Be Worried About North Korea: How To Make Beijing A ...	In recent days North Korea has become a problem child not only for China but for the US as well. Its dictator Kim Jong Un who rules by fear of persecution or death to those people he considers disloyal to his regime, a characteristic that all dictators have to perpetuate their rule. Adolf Hitler who had fought in the First Great War had this characteristic in abundance and took advantage of the burning of Reichstag and total disregard of the treaty he had signed with the Soviet Union. Recently White House confirmed that North Korea—a country with few allies and little money—had sent thousands of soldiers to join Russia in its war against Ukraine. But sending personnel marks a new level of coordination. There are other signs of warming ties, too. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first trip to North Korea in over two decades. CHINA’S DISPLEASURE OVER RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA TIES That proximity has irked China, North Korea’s main backer. Chinese officials fear that Russia’s influence over the insular dictatorship is growing at China’s expense. They also worry that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will strengthen military cooperation in response to Russia and North Korea’s newfound closeness. Over the past year, Beijing has chosen to react to Pyongyang’s collaboration with Moscow by publicly courting North Korea’s adversaries. For instance, in May, China held a trilateral summit with South Korea and Japan after a five-year hiatus. Russia and North Korea signed an agreement on boosting economic cooperation following a meeting between trade officials in Pyongyang. Hungary will install additional air defense systems in the northeast of the country due to concerns over the fighting in Ukraine spreading into Hungarian territory. The Hungarian defense minister said the threat of escalation between Ukraine and Russia is 'greater than ever.' Russia became the top supplier of natural gas to the European Union in September for the first time since May 2022, according to a calculation by Russia’s RIA Novosti using Eurostat data. European purchases of Russian gas in September were valued at 1.4 billion euros ($1.47 billion), an increase of a third over the previous September. Roughly forty percent of the supplies is liquefied natural gas and sixty percent is pipeline gas. CHINA-SOUTH KOREA HOLD SECURITY DIALOGUE Chinese and South Korean officials held a security dialogue in Seoul—the first such meeting in nine years. This seeming friction between China and North Korea has tantalized many Western security analysts, who have argued that the United States and its allies should try to drive a wedge between China and North Korea. Such an effort, however, would be futile. Despite signs of tension between the two countries, North Korea is overwhelmingly reliant on China. Nearly all of its trade, for instance, is with China. The countries have not always seen eye to eye but their relationship has never come close to splintering. WHAT THE USA SHOULD DO? Instead of focusing on what could divide North Korea from China, the United States should collaborate with the Chinese government to rein in North Korea’s volatile behavior. Both the United States and China are ultimately invested in maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula. Working together to restrain the North Korean regime is the best way to achieve it. Although North Korea is often imagined these days as a mere satrap of China, it is not, in fact, a Chinese vassal, and it has long sought to achieve a great degree of autonomy in its foreign policy. The two countries have endured many moments of friction in their relationship. The fact that China tolerated open criticism of North Korea’s leadership put further strain on the relationship between the two governments. During the rapprochement between China and the United States in the 1970s North Korea hosted Soviet naval ships in its ports and allowed Soviet fighter jets to enter North Korean airspace. CHINA’S DIPLOMATIC CONTACT WITH SOUTH KOREA. Throughout the 1980s, in response to North Korea’s tilt toward Russia, China increased its diplomatic contacts with South Korea. Relations between China and North Korea hit another low point in 1992, when China formally established diplomatic relations with South Korea against Kim’s wishes. China further irked North Korea by joining international sanctions against Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons programs in 2006. Pyongyang, for its part, often acted without consulting Beijing on matters that could seriously affect China’s security. In 2006, following North Korea’s first nuclear test, Beijing accused Pyongyang of 'brazen' action, a term rarely used in official Chinese statements. North Korea’s nuclear tests violated a treaty between the two countries that requires them to 'consult with each other on all important international questions of common interest.' WHY NORTH KOREA TURNED TO RUSSIA Unsure of China’s intentions, North Korea has turned to Russia for economic, diplomatic, and military cooperation. Through these punitive measures, China is not just trying to chastise Pyongyang for cozying up to Russia; it’s also seeking to curry favor with the United States and Europe. Since the summit between Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden in November 2023, Beijing has appeared determined to stabilize U.S.-Chinese relations so that it can still attract foreign investment from Western countries and maintain strong trading ties with them. In this context, North Korea’s belligerence toward South Korea and Japan and its military support of Russia has become a liability for China’s engagement with the West, because the United States and Europe see China as North Korea’s patron, and therefore as partly responsible for Pyongyang’s behavior. UNCERTAINITY IN CHINA IF NORTH KOREA IS PUSHED TO A CORNER. It is highly uncertain—even to China’s leadership—how Pyongyang would act if backed into a corner. In the worst-case scenario, Pyongyang may resort to attacking South Korea to deliberately create an external crisis, forcing China to intervene on North Korea’s behalf. Therefore, Beijing has to carefully assess the risks when considering how much it can push North Korea. In the current era of U.S.-Chinese strategic competition, North Korea’s value to China extends beyond its role as a buffer zone between Chinese and U.S. forces. From Beijing’s perspective, during a conflict with the United States over Taiwan, maintaining close ties with North Korea is advantageous because Pyongyang can help tie down U.S. troops in the region by keeping open the possibility of another war. But it remains uncertain whether Beijing would coordinate with North Korea before taking military action against Taiwan or whether they would even want to coordinate such involvement if it could lead to conflict spreading from the Taiwan Strait to the Korean Peninsula. US SHOULD PREVENT OUTBREAK OF WAR ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA To avoid such an outcome, the United States and its allies should focus on identifying interests they share with China: namely, preventing the outbreak of a war on the Korean Peninsula. Expecting Beijing to take extreme measures, such as suspending oil supplies or humanitarian aid to North Korea, is unrealistic. Instead of driving China and North Korea apart, Washington should try to capitalize on Beijing’s power over Pyongyang by urging China to clearly communicate two redlines to its partner. First, North Korea must refrain from directly assaulting South Korean lives and property, as it did in the 2010 Cheonan torpedo attack and Yeonpyeong Island shelling. Since these incidents, South Korea’s military doctrine has become far more offensive. Any North Korean attack, even on a limited scale, would trigger South Korean retaliation, and could spiral into all-out war. Second, North Korea must avoid conducting its seventh nuclear test. A seventh test would likely be geared toward developing a nuclear weapon with a small yield that would be easier to deploy. Such a test would be a sign of China’s weakening influence over Pyongyang and could spur Seoul to try to acquire nuclear weapons of its own—a position that both South Korea and the United States officially oppose but is gaining traction in Western policy circles. DEEPENING TIES WITH RUSSIA POSES CONCERN RELATING TO WAR IN UKRAINE AND SECURITY ON KOREAN PENINSULA. The deepening ties between Russia and North Korea have sparked significant concerns in the US regarding the potential impact on the war in Ukraine and security on the Korean Peninsula. But the rapprochement between Moscow and Pyongyang has also caused mixed feelings in Beijing, as they create new uncertainty for China. Despite being North Korea’s neighbor, economic lifeline and formal ally, China’s relations with North Korea are far from close, as recent developments indicate. North Korea’s condemnation of a joint statement by South Korea, Japan, and China during their first trilateral summit since 2019 was seen as a rare rebuke against China. The statement mentioned denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang’s provocative actions around the same time further signaled its displeasure with the summit. It is remarkable that the Kim regime chose to launch a military spy satellite into orbit during a major diplomatic initiative involving China. The last time North Korea clearly sought to embarrass China was shortly prior to the inaugural Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in May 2017, when it conducted a missile launch from a base near the Chinese border. Since then, the regional dynamics have shifted significantly. IMROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA WITH APPEARANCE OF XI-JINPING. After hitting their lowest point in decades in 2017, China-North Korea relations began to improve significantly following the first meeting between Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un in March 2018. Despite having met five times since then, their relationship is not back to being 'as close as lips and teeth,' as described once by Mao Zedong. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s isolation from the West has led to a deepening of relations between Moscow and Pyongyang, resulting in enhanced military cooperation between the two states. It is believed that in exchange for large amounts of North Korean munitions and ballistic missiles for Russia’s war in Ukraine, Moscow is providing North Korea with military technology, increasing Pyongyang’s military capabilities. CLOSE RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA RELATIONS POSESS A CHALLENGE TO THE WEST Beijing, a key partner of both Pyongyang and Moscow, has refrained. However, the Chinese media was quick to blame the United States claiming that its 'hostile' policy has driven Russia and North Korea closer together, thereby undermining the security situation in both regions. The Chinese portrayal of the United States as the primary instigator of tensions reflects China’s belief that Washington is its greatest threat and enemy, not Pyongyang. In response to North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile capabilities, the United States has strengthened its military cooperation with South Korea and Japan, much to China’s dismay. Beijing has long accused Washington of using the North Korean nuclear issue as a pretext to expand its military presence in the region, thereby further exacerbating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. WHAT DOES WASHINGTON WANT? Most of China’s foreign policy thinkers believe that Washington’s overall goal is not to deter North Korea but to contain China. Given that China views its foreign policy through the lens of its broader rivalry with the United States, both in Asia and globally, it is highly unlikely that Beijing will exert pressure on on either North Korea or Russia to resolve the conflicts in Northeast Asia or Europe. For China, the Kim regime remains an important buffer zone against an increasing encirclement by the U.S. and its allies, while Russia serves as an important ally in countering a U.S.-led world order. However, Beijing’s choice to not 'interfere' might, in the long run, undermine its own strategic interests. By staying on the sidelines as ties between Russia and North Korea deepen, China risks potentially exacerbating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. WITH RUSSIAN HELP CAN KIM JUNG UN DEVELOP NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES? With Russia’s help, the Kim regime is likely to accelerate the development of its nuclear capabilities. This could lead to a stronger response from the United States, and, in a worst-case scenario for Beijing, lead up to the formation of what the Chinese call a U.S.-led 'Asian NATO' aimed at targeting China. Furthermore, an emboldened North Korea increases the possibility of a more aggressive and provocative behavior, possibly stepping up its weapon testing or, even more concerning, conducting a seventh nuclear test. This inevitably would place China in a position where it is exposed to the escalation of conflicts it prefers to avoid. As a result, Beijing would face intense international pressure, particularly from the United States, to take a stronger stance against the Kim regime. DESPITE BEIJING’S TOTAL SUPPORT FOR PYOGYANG RELATIONS WITH RUSIA IS A GREAT WORRY. Despite Beijing’s economic and diplomatic support for Pyongyang, they are anything but close friends. The very fact that Kim’s first post-pandemic foreign trip was to Russia rather than China raises questions about the current state of their relationship. While Kim Jong Un has now held two summits with Putin in less than a year, Xi Jinping has not met the North Korean leader since 2019. Moreover, North Korea’s efforts to strengthen its ties with Iran further alleviate its isolation signaling a strategic attempt toward diversifying its alliances and bolstering its nuclear and ballistic missile cooperation. These new dynamics significantly complicate China’s balancing act in the region. NORTH KOREAN SOLDIERS IN WAR AGAINST UKRAINE In November 2024 Asia Policy Institute for China analysis has revealed confirmation by the White House that North Korea — a country with few allies and little money — had sent thousands of soldiers to join Russia in its war against Ukraine. Pyongyang was already supplying Moscow with weapons: according to the Times of London, half of Russia’s shells used in the war have come from North Korea. But sending personnel marks a new level of coordination. There are other signs of warming ties, too. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first trip to North Korea in over two decades. That proximity has irked China North Korea’s main backer. Chinese officials fear that Russia’s influence over the insular dictatorship is growing at China’s expense. They also worry that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will strengthen military cooperation in response to Russia and North Korea’s newfound closeness. CHINESE REACTION TO NORTH KOREA’S TRUANCY Over the past year, Beijing has chosen to react to Pyongyang’s collaboration with Moscow by publicly courting North Korea’s adversaries. For instance, in May, China held a trilateral summit with South Korea and Japan after a five-year hiatus. Coincidentally it coincided with Putin’s visit to Pyongyang. Chinese and South Korean officials held a security dialogue in Seoul — the first such meeting in nine years. CONCLUSION This seeming friction between China and North Korea has tantalized many Western security analysts, who have argued that the United States and its allies should try to drive a wedge between China and North Korea. Such an effort, however, would be futile. Despite signs of tension between the two countries, North Korea is overwhelmingly reliant on China. Nearly all of its trade, for instance, is with China. The countries have not always seen eye to eye over the past 75 years, but their relationship has never come close to splintering. Instead of focusing on what could divide North Korea from China, the United States should collaborate with the Chinese government to rein in North Korea’s volatile behavior. Both the United States and China are ultimately invested in maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula.

Eni Launches Hull Of Nguya FLNG, Confirming Schedule Of Congo LNG...	Eni announced Saturday the launch of the hull of the Nguya Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility in Wison shipyard in Nantong, China. The state-of-the-art FLNG will have a liquefaction capacity of 2.4 million tons per annum (MTPA), and will complement the existing Tango FLNG, which is operational since December 2023 with a capacity of 0.6 MTPA, bringing the total liquefaction capacity of Congo LNG project to 3 MTPA by the end of 2025. The ceremony was attended by the Minister of Hydrocarbons of the Republic of Congo, Bruno Jean Richard Itoua. Guido Brusco, Eni’s Chief Operating Officer, Global Natural Resources, said: 'We celebrate this milestone together with our partners as a testament of the solid collaboration between Eni and the Republic of Congo. We have been the first to believe in the value of Congo's gas, primarily for domestic power generation, and then for export. With the successful launch of the Nguya FLNG hull, the Congo LNG Project has reached an impressive milestone of 40 million hours worked without any Lost Time Injuries. This achievement underscores the project’s ongoing progress in valorizing Congo’s gas resources, while capitalizing on local and international opportunities to deliver further value for our stakeholders'. The timely launch of the hull confirms the company’s industry-leading time-to-market performances. Completion activities for Nguya FLNG have progressed at 80%, while overall Phase 2 timing - from FLNG contract award to startup - is expected to amount to less than 3 years, leveraging Eni’s fast-track approach that allows the execution of engineering, construction and commissioning activities seamlessly to rapidly develop new projects. Nguya FLNG has a reduced carbon footprint thanks to its design and technology, and to its zero-flaring approach, in line with Eni’s decarbonisation strategy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EBtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-23T16:06:01-08:00	
Ukrainian Archbishop Encourages Trump To Go To Ukraine	By Kate Quiñones A Ukrainian archbishop says he has encouraged President-elect Donald Trump to visit Ukraine to help 'build a policy for the future.' During a Friday interview with 'EWTN News In Depth' anchor Catherine Hadro, Archbishop Borys Gudziak of the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia said that he spoke briefly with Trump before the election at the Oct. 17 Al Smith dinner, where he encouraged Trump to visit Ukraine. Gudziak has subsequently written a letter to the president-elect to the same effect. 'I think if he went now, before the inauguration, for example, with a group of religious leaders on a humanitarian mission, he would see for himself what is happening on the ground,' Gudziak explained. 'Everybody that has gone to Ukraine — cardinals, political leaders, humanitarian workers, people who were skeptical, people that knew a lot — all came out knowing much, much more and understanding more deeply what’s happening.' 'So I would encourage President Trump to go to Ukraine,' Gudziak said, as 'a base on which to build a policy for the future.' Nov. 19 marked 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. Ukraine on Tuesday used U.S. missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory, following President Joe Biden’s authorization of such use. Russian forces shot down five of six of the missiles that were fired at a military facility. Gudziak said of the somber milestone: 'It is a time of mourning.' 'There’s great pain and great wounds in our people, in our Church,' Gudziak noted. 'At the same time, there’s great gratitude. Most observers internationally, and particularly Putin, thought Ukraine would fall in a matter of three days or three weeks. And now, three years later, the people still stand, keep standing, defending their God-given dignity, their freedom, their democracy.' Devastating toll Hundreds of thousands have been killed as a result of the Russian invasion, with more than 14 million people forced to leave their homes. The archbishop noted that 4,000 schools and 2,000 hospitals have been destroyed. 'There’s great suffering, great trauma which will be lasting,' Gudziak said. 'But there is also the sense of courage and gratitude for God’s graces that Russia has not occupied all of Ukraine and that the country is still free.' When asked what it’s like for Catholics in Ukraine, Gudziak said that 'the public life of the Catholic Church has been virtually extinguished' in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia has occupied parts of three regions. 'There [are] no Ukrainian Catholic priests functioning there now, and a couple of priests who were abducted and tortured for 18 months, who were freed in the summer — they show the scars of what Russian captivity is like,' the archbishop said. 'For Catholics, it should be clear that Russian occupation means [the] extinguishing of our normal church life,' he continued. But Gudziak noted that Catholic charities have come together to support Ukrainians, including Caritas Ukraine, a Catholic charity in Ukraine. 'Bishops and priests are in place, serving the people, celebrating the sacraments, announcing the good news, but also very much engaged in humanitarian work, helping those that have lost their homes, their possessions, distributing clothing, food, fostering medical care,' he said. 'Very importantly, the Church reminds people of their God-given dignity, the fact that the Lord is with them, that every hair on their head is counted' and that the country has lived through 'even more harrowing experiences,' he said. 'During World War II, between the Nazis and the Soviets, 6 [million] to 7 million residents of Ukraine were killed and the whole country was devastated,' Gudziak continued. 'Ukrainians know they’ve lived through the crucifixion and have resurrected in the past. So the Church announces this paschal Kerygma: We carry our cross and God will give us life.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EM7O1tblkgm4	2024-11-23T16:04:07-08:00	
Why Muslims OK Abrogated Verses In The Qur’an – OpEd	Muslims believe Allah sent tens of thousands of Prophets to all of the tribes, nations and kingdoms in the world; and 313 Messengers who like Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad, brought to their believers a special sacred book. Jews and Christians can agree to this. All prophets and their followers were Muslims (submitters to the one and only God), though Muslims do tend to conflate the general and specific meanings of the words Islam and Muslim. Five messenger prophets received scriptures from Allah prior to the Qur'an, notably the Scrolls of Abraham (now lost), the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus. Most Muslim scholars in later generations claimed that the messages and books had become corrupted or were lost. Jews and Christians strongly reject this slander because the Qur'an itself states: 'So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you (the Jews and Christians). The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (10:94) Also many Qur'an verses have been abrogated by other verses. Not all Muslims believe that the Quran abrogates itself and would reject these traditions. Yet, many Muslims do believe that the Quran abrogates itself. According to some scholars the Qur'an abrogates only the Qur'an. They base their view on verses 2:106 and 16:101. According to them the Qur'an does not abrogate the sunna (law) nor does the sunna abrogate the Qur'an. This is the view held by Shafi'i. Others claim that the Qur'an may abrogate the Qur'an as well as the sunnah (law). They base their view on Sura 53:3-4 The Muslim scholar Ahmad Von Denffer said regarding the conflicting views held by Muslim scholars over the precise nature of abrogation: 'The number of verses that are considered to have been abrogated increased dramatically between the eighth and eleventh centuries (al-Zuhri mentions 42 abrogated verses, al-Nahhas 138, and Ibn Salama, 238), at which point an upper limit seems to have been reached (Ibn 'Ata'iqi identifies 231 abrogated verses, and al-Farsi, 248). Yet 'al-Suyuti (died 1505 CE) recognized only twenty instances of true abrogation, and Shah Wali Allah (died 1762 CE) reduced that number to five. Here is a good example from: SAHIH BUKHARI Volume 6, Book 60, Number 13: Narrated Al-Bara: The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he (really) wished that his Qibla would be the Ka'ba (at Mecca). (So Allah revealed verse (2:144) and he Prophet Muhammad) offered 'Asr prayers (in his Mosque facing Ka'ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. 'A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, 'I testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.' Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka'ba while they were still bowing. 'Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka'ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:-- 'Allah would never make your faith (prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem are holy). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.' (2.143) The many dozens of Prophets in the Hebrew Bible make only a few references to the religious texts of prior religions. The New Testament is an add on to the Hebrew Bible; which quotes the Hebrew Bible 302+ times, and claims to be the Old Tenement's fulfillment. The Qur'an is a stand alone text which mentions both Torah and Injil together 12 times, mentions Injil three times, and Torah six times by themselves; and quotes the Zabur only once (Psalm 37:9,11,29) in Qur'an 21:105. The term suhuf (scrolls Qur'an 20:133, 21:48, 87:19) is used for texts of Prophets Abraham, Aaron and Moses which were written separately, and later added in as part of the Oral Torah written down by the rabbis in the second century. (Qur'an 6:91) This was the original meaning of Tahrif. At first it would seem that Tahrif (Arabic: تحريف, 'distortion, alteration') an Arabic term used by Muslims for the alterations which Islamic tradition claims Jews and Christians have made to their revealed books, specifically the Tawrat (Torah), Zabur (Psalms) and Injil (Gospels); is the direct opposite of Midrash. In the Zabur of Prophet David it is written: 'One thing God has spoken; two things have I heard' (Psalms 62:12). The rabbis in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 34a) asserted that this means there are multiple interpretations of each verse of Scripture that can be correct, and the word of God, even if they contradict one another. The Hebrew term for this concept of pluralistic interpretation of sacred scriptures is Midrash. Midrash (מדרשׁ) is an interpretive activity of seeking answers to religious questions (both practical and spiritual) by plumbing the meaning of every word in the Torah. In the Bible, the root d-r-sh [דרשׁ] means inquiring into any matter, including seeking out God's word. Midrash responds to contemporary problems and crafts new narratives, making connections between new Jewish realities and the ancient unchanging Hebrew text. Midrash falls into two categories.When the subject is law and religious practice (halacha ), it is called Midrash halacha. Midrash aggadah, on the other hand, interprets biblical poetry, prophecy and narrative, exploring questions of ethics or theology, and creating lessons, new insights and different views all based on the ancient text. In some ways Midrash is like Islamic Tafsir, meaning 'to discover'. Tafsir is the explanation or interpretation of something 'exposing its secrets. Written by rabbis steeped in the Bible and absorbed by the many different questions that arise over the centuries, midrash occupies the meeting ground between reverence and love for the word of the fixed text of the Torah, and religious creativity in meeting new developments in society and culture. Midrash thus yields religious insights that have made Torah directly applicable to the later realities of Jewish life. The best-known rabbinic midrash is the legend of Prophet Abraham, who as a young child in Mesopotamia smashed his father's idols. Not just a simple morality tale about a national hero, the text in Midrash Rabbah for Genesis suggests that Abraham's selection by God did not come out of nowhere, as Genesis 12 literally reads. Rather, Abraham had independently come to a point where he would be receptive to the voice of the one God. This midrash lays out Prophet Abraham's relationship to his family and to the people and culture around him, and his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. It is not only a depiction of this patriarch, but also a model of an ideal spiritual personality for Jews, Christians and Muslims in any age and foreign culture. The narrative about Abraham breaking his father's idols is related in the Qur'an once in 19:41-50 and again in 21:51-66 for a total of 24 verses. In the written Torah this event is not mentioned at all; but it is the center of several oral Torah Midrash accounts. This would be called Tahrif by Muslims; and is called Midrash by Jews, but if you ask most Jews today, especially well educated Jews who are less educated in Judaism, where the Abraham breaking his father's idols event is related; they will respond it is written in the Book of Genesis in the Torah. So the Qur'an states: 'And there is a party among them who twist their tongues while reciting the [Torah] Book to make you think that it [their Midrash/Tafsir] is part of the Book, when in fact it is not. They say: 'It is from Allah', when in fact it is not from Allah. They falsely fix a lie upon Allah, and do so wittingly.' (3:78) As a Reform Rabbi I agree with the above ayah. The party the Qur'an criticizes are those Orthodox Rabbis, who when the subject was law and religious practice (Midrash halacha) kept expanding the number of dietary laws, the strictness of Sabbath restrictions, and female purity laws. Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, 'Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So do not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded.' (Bukhari Vol. 1, Book 2, # 38) Reform Rabbis regard the increasingly restrictive developments in the laws of kosher diet, especially for Passover, as a counterproductive, overburdening of the Jewish people by extra-pious Orthodox rabbis. The expansion of restrictions on Shabbat activities is also seen by Reform Rabbis as a counterproductive, overburdening of the joy of Shabbat. The Qur'an wisely differentiates between extremism and striving to be near perfect (no one is perfect) which involves a rejection of extremism. Just trying to do well will be rewarded. Religion should not be hard. Making religion easier does not mean making religion soft or impious. This is a very important Hadith because all religions have believers that think that more is always better, and that much harder is still better.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EDxQzcghq1AP	2024-11-23T16:02:17-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Challenges Of Financial Realignmen...	In a Visual Capitalist report of September 17th, 2024, it was noted that the US Dollar dominates the world reserve currencies at 59%. It is followed by the Euro at 20%, the Japanese Yen at 6% and the British Pound at 5%. All other currencies followed with smaller shares, indicating that despite the great fanfare of BRICS Plus, most reserves are still held in the West’s major currencies. The above four currencies control some 90% of world currency reserves. The Chinese Renminbi held only 2% while all the others together held some 8% of the US$ 11.5 trillion of global reserves. The US Dollar’s share came down from 70% in 2000 but nevertheless remains the main currency of reserves in the world. It is expected to continue in this leading position in the decades to come, although there is a growing usage of non-traditional reserves, such as the Chinese Renminbi. The BRICS Plus countries are the biggest holders of most non-traditional currencies and mostly the Chinese Renminbi, which contributed some 25% of the shift away from the US Dollar. We will attempt to address in this article the impact of the shifting away from the US Dollar or the impact of the BRICS Plus on the Horn of Africa States region. The region is one of the poorest in the world and when it comes to volumes, nothing much will happen to the issue of reserves. Indeed, the region has no impact on what happens on the world’s reserves at present. Ethiopia has the largest reserves in the region with only a minuscule US$ 3 billion including gold, as of 2020, as reported by the World Bank earlier in this month of November 2024. However, when it comes to politicking and the challenges of the region, there appears to be reasons to watch. Ethiopia earlier this year embarked on challenging Somalia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty as a nation by signing an illegal MoU with one of the regions of country without going through the Federal authorities of the country. Somalia’s reaction was severe and quickly and forcefully defended its territorial integrity through all the diplomatic channels available to it. This included among other seeking help from other countries like Türkiye and Egypt to defend the country’s lands and waters from the blatant invasion, expelled Ethiopia’s ambassador and refused to include Ethiopia in the AUSOM force of the African Union to be deployed in the country after the mandate of the ATMIS force ends on December 31st, 2024. The world held its breath during the whole year and scrambled to avoid a physical war between the two countries. The irony is that two new members of the BRICS Plus countries include Egypt and Ethiopia, which have their own difficulties on the issue of the Blue Nile and the GERD built by Ethiopia on the river. Ethiopia has not so far moved into the realization of the illegal MoU and since then, there was a change of governance in the Somali region, which was forced to sign the MoU by the Ethiopian administration. Somalia has not yet taken other steps which could include suspension of Ethiopian Airlines flights to the country or overflights in Somalia’s airspace, which is vast or other more serious actions that may adversely affect Ethiopia without firing a shot of its own. Ethiopia is currently undergoing one of the most serious not only financial difficulties but also existential threats. The IMF and the World Bank have recently organized extending some conditioned financial assistance for the country, but this may not help in the ethnic-based conflicts in the country. The war in the Amhara State, the OLA war, the Tigray war shimmering under the ashes, the Afar Somali states continuing war, the attempts of the Oromia state to move on to the Somali State and the antagonistic relations the country has developed with all the neighboring countries, all point to a country barely surviving and trying to export its woes to others. Somalia, another fragile country in the region, appears to have been its main target and hence the illegal MoU. Negotiations between Somalia and Ethiopia was organized by the international community and Türkiye played the central role in this respect, but these negotiations have brought any good results fruits, so far, with Ethiopia still insisting on proceeding with the materialization of the MoU. It is not clear whether the new administration of the Somali region, which changed hands recently through a well-organized election process, will follow the policies of the old administration or not. However, there is reason to believe that it would not and would change priorities to meet the needs of its population. This may lead to a more stable region, which will step back from the brink of war. It is most unfortunate that the Ethiopian regime has underestimated the Somali resolve to defend their territories at all costs, including the large Somali population within Ethiopia who number anywhere between twenty-five to thirty million people, although the fake statistics given by the Ethiopian government does not report this. How does one read the Ethiopian BRICS adventure and the region? In this respect, one must note that the West where the Bretton Woods multilateral financial organizations of the World Bank and the IMF are rooted, would vehemently oppose this ill-thought of move on the part of Ethiopia. This is a direct assault on these institutions, which are economically and financially competing with the Chinese BRI project and other financial institutions. It is not clear what the intentions of the arrangements of the two organizations with Ethiopia are or represent. The move of Ethiopia to the BRICS may, however, lead Somalia to move closer to the West. Note the region overlooks a major shipping route connecting Asia, Africa and Europe. It is also reported to own vast natural resources including oil and gas, which seems to have been identified most recently by the Turkish Exploration ship Oruc Reis. If one has already arrangements with the country that owns the longest coast in the region, would there be a need to create new and unpredictable processes such as the Ethiopian forced MoU with one of the regions of Somalia imply? It is clear that Ethiopia is being used by outsider forces. The United Arab Emirates, which has substantial interests in the region is generally reported to be behind the adventure story of Ethiopia as financiers and political backers. Ethiopia, a poor nation grappling with its multitude of problems would not venture into such a major project, some say. The UAE is already in Berbera, a major port of Somalia in the north but does not trust the owners of the port, Somalis and it is why it is pushing, some say, Ethiopia to launch the search for a port in Somali waters and take over Somali territories. Both the UAE and Ethiopia and eventually the BRICS seem to be underestimating the Somali despite the weaknesses in Somali governance. What they do not know is that Somalis are generally better Somalis when foreigners invade their country, and as families, they all congregate to defend the home. The oil and gas potential recently discovered in the country and its seas would generally provide the financial needs of the country and money is what counts in the world of today. Somalia is already improving and rebuilding its land, air and naval forces and its relations with the West is expected to be a wall against the adventures of BRICS Plus and its ally, Ethiopia, an economically small country with not much to contribute.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EOFb4avN7oh8	2024-11-23T16:00:52-08:00	
Facing Armageddon And Yajuj-Majuj With Hope And Faith -OpEd	More than seven percent of all deaths in 10 of India's biggest cities are linked to air pollution. Smog-filled Indian cities like Delhi suffer from some of the world's worst air pollution, with 12,000 annual deaths linked to air pollution. An international study involving 52 researchers from around the world found that one in every five species of reptiles on earth is facing extinction. Out of 10,196 reptile species covered by the research, close to 2,000 species are in danger of dying out, said the authors of the study, the first of its kind to address the issue on such a large scope. The word Armageddon does not appear in the Hebrew Bible, and appears only once in the Greek New Testament, in Revelation 16:16 which makes no mention of armies being predicted to one day gather on or near Mount Megiddo; but instead seems to predict only that 'they (will gather) the kings together to ... Armageddon'. We know now that oil, gas and coal are the kings of global warming. The book of Revelation text does seem to imply, based on the text from an earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the 'place called Armageddon' is 'for the war of the great day of God Almighty' which is now seen as the ongoing battle against Global Warming. The Madhi himself may already have been born. Yajuj and Majuj are mentioned both in Qur'an and hadith. In Islam their appearance will be one of the signs of the end times. These events will transpire after the arrival of Dajjal, Mahdi and Prophet Jesus. Gog and Magog ('Gog u-Magog' in Hebrew and 'Yajuj and Majuj' in Arabic) are names that appear in the Hebrew Bible, and in the Qur'an. They are sometimes personified as individuals, and sometimes identified as nations or as geographic regions: but all references in Bible, Qur'an and Hadith (oral and then written tradition) clearly indicate that they are very numerous in number, and will appear from the north toward the end of times, before the Day of Judgement: 'They said, 'O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are [great] corrupters in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make a barrier between us and them?' (Qur'an 18:94) —[Dhul-Qarnayn] said, 'This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it level, and ever true is the promise of my Lord. And We will leave them that day surging over each other, and [when] the Horn will be blown, We will assemble them in [one] assembly.' (18:98-99) A Hadith transmitted by both Imam Al- Bukhari and Imam Muslim, on the authority of Zainab Bint Jahsh relates that Prophet Muhammad once came to her in a state of fear and said: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. Woe unto the Arabs from a danger that has come near. An opening has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this,' making a circle with his thumb and index finger. Zainab Bint Jahsh said: 'O Allah's Messenger! Shall we be destroyed even though there are pious persons among us?' He said: 'Yes, when evil persons will increase.' In 2011 the 'Arab Spring' filled most of the world with great hopes. Now, 13 years later, the near east is filled with increasing conflict, anxiety, fear, and despair. According to a worldwide poll for Reuters (May 2, 2012) 'nearly 15 percent of people worldwide believe the world will end during their lifetime'. That number is surely much higher by now. 'Whether they think it [the world] will come to an end through the hands of God, or a natural disaster or political events, whatever the reason, one in seven thinks the end of the world is coming,' said Keren Gottfried, research manager at Ipsos Global Public Affairs which conducted the poll for Reuters. Why are so many people so negative and pessimistic about the future of humanity While it is true that human society has changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last 200 years than ever before in human history, humanity has already survived several major revolutions and world wars. Doctors today save the lives of millions; while dictators sacrifice the lives of millions. Populations are exploding in Africa and populations are declining in Europe. Technology produces both worldwide prosperity and worldwide pollution at the same time. Should we look upon the 21st century with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation? Is the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday? Or are both occurring almost concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? The long tradition of trying to foresee the distant, eventual goal of human history started with the Prophets of Israel over 2.700 years ago. The Biblical vision of a Messianic Age may provide us with guidance in understanding the social, economic, scientific and cultural upheavals that will sweep society as it approaches the next stage. Often, it is the dramatic dangers of the pre-Messianic tribulation that are emphasized in Christian, Islamic and Jewish post scriptural traditions. I will focus on the positive signs developing throughout the world that accord with the Messianic vision of the Biblical Prophets.In most religious traditions, redemption is defined in terms of individual enlightenment or personal salvation. However, the Prophets of Israel conceived of redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of a transformation of the Jewish people. This will take place in this world at some future time. Is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her own religion, that would itself bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps. As the Qur'an states, 'Accountability for mankind is getting closer and closer, yet they are heedless and turn away.' (Al-Anbiya 1 and Al-Qamar 1-8) God of course, is always ready to help us defeat evil, if we are ready to work for the establishment of a just and peaceful local and world society; that is why one or more Messiahs will come. A Messiah is a human agent of God who helps bring about this transformation. This agent of God (with several forerunners and many disciples) will be a person with great leadership qualities; similar to Prophets Moses or Muhammad. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Messianic Age is usually seen as the solution to all of humanity's basic problems. This may be true in the long run, but the vast changes the transition to the Messianic Age entails, will provide challenges to society for many generations to come. For example, the Prophet Isaiah, 2,700 years ago, predicted that someday there would be a radically new world in which Jerusalem would be filled with joy for 'no more shall there be in it an infant that lives only a few days.' (65:20) A century ago, the infant mortality rate in Jerusalem (as in most of the world) was 25-30%. Now, infant mortality is less than 1%. For thousands of years almost every family in the world suffered the loss of at least one or two infants; now it happens to less than one out of a hundred. Truly we are close to Isaiah's prophecy, 'One who dies at 100 years shall be reckoned a youth, and one who fails to reach 100 shall be reckoned accursed.' (65:20). Such radical change will necessitate major changes in the way we think and act when faced with decisions about life and death. Yet who among us would want to return to the high mortality rates and early deaths of previous centuries? The fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy has thus gone unnoticed and uncelebrated. If you had told Soviet Jews a generation ago that the Communist regime would collapse, the Soviet Empire disintegrate, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews would emigrate to Israel, they would have conceived it only as a Messianic dream. In our own generation therefore we have seen the dramatic fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy: 'I will bring your offspring from the (Middle) East and gather you from the (European) West. To the North (Russia) I will say 'give them up' and to the South (Ethiopia) 'do not hold them'. Bring my sons from far away, my daughters from the end of the earth.' (43:5-6) Isn't it amazing how people adjust to living in a radically new world and forget the past. Indeed, the Prophet Isaiah himself said, 'Behold, I create a new Heaven and a new Earth, and former things shall not be remembered.' (65:17) Where does the Messiah fit in with all of this? He will still have lots to do when he arrives. Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a small Jewish house of worship 'hologram', which is a 3D projection created with lasers, could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock and 600 feet north of the Al-Aksa Mosque, provided that Muslims would agree to cooperate. Anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important, and anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, Jewish/Christian/Muslim agreements establishing world wide peace would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each Jewish-Christian-Muslim community could consider its leadership to be essentially Messianic, Indeed, such Jewish-Christian-Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its own leadership to be essential Messianic aids as is foretold: ('Saviors [plural] will come up on mount Zion' Obadiah 1:21) and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Micah (4:3-5): 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk, each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings; the Messianic Age of world wide peace will surely have arrived, and then-and only then-will the Temple of Solomon be rebuilt, and God's Holy Kingdom established on earth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EJfa9AtxhdHe	2024-11-23T15:54:50-08:00	
Ukraine Military Situation: Russian Forces Unleash Massive Barrag...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Biden Administration Eases Restrictions on Use of US-Provided Weapons In a major development, the Biden administration gave Ukraine permissionto use American long-range weaponry, particularly the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to strike military targets inside Russia. Subsequently, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that France and the United Kingdom had followed suit by allowing Ukraine to use SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles for the same purpose, though the publication revised that reportshortly after its release to indicate that London and Paris were only engaging in 'debates' on the question. Press sources report that Washington may still be limiting Kyiv’s use of American munitions to targets relevant to Ukraine’s Kursk incursion. Regardless, the Biden administration’s decision to remove the restraints came not a moment too soon. The Ukrainian Armed Forces need to target Russia’s strategic depth, particularly critical military basing structures and force groupings in assembly areas. Depending on its warhead configuration and variant, the ATACMS is well-suited for this role. 2. North Korean Heavy Artillery Spotted in Russia Geolocated open-source imagery identified North Korean M1989 Koksan 170mm self-propelled howitzers on Russian railways near Krasnoyarsk last week, indicating that Pyongyang has stepped up its tactical support for the Kremlin. These North Korean systems are formidable, as artillery has traditionally determined the conventional military balance on the Korean Peninsula. Declassified field assessments conclude that Pyongyang possesses dangerous fire-support capabilities, and the United States Defense Intelligence Agencyhas determined that North Korea’s massed artillery and special forces units pose a significant threat to South Korea. Of all its artillery systems, Pyongyang’s 170mm-class self-propelled howitzers and 240mm-class heavy multiple-launch rocket systems are the most powerful. The 170mm Koksan howitzer has an operational range of 37 miles and can unleash an initial burst of four rounds in one minute, followed by one round every three minutes. It is designed to fire from protected areas and relocate for reloading. Pyongyang has hundreds of Koksan guns in its arsenal and can afford to send a significant number to the Kremlin. What remains unknown is whether North Korea is sending its artillery systems to support Russian units or to augment its own 10,000-strong 11th Corps detachments in the Russian region of Kursk. While open-source intelligence is thus far limited, it is distinctly possible that the North Korean 11th Corps is only the vanguard of a larger follow-on force. 3. Boosting Ukraine’s Growing F-16 Fleet In recent weeks the Biden administration has worked to boost the capabilities of Ukraine’s burgeoning F-16 fighter aircraft fleet. The Pentagon has permitted American defense contractors to operate in Ukraine so weapons systems that Washington has transferred to Kyiv can be maintained and repaired in country. This decision will make US-made F-16s and Patriot strategic air and missile defense systems much easier for Ukraine to use. The United States has also provided the Ukrainian Air Force with an intensive F-16 training program in Arizona, further enhancing Ukraine’s air warfare capabilities. Of Ukraine’s European partners, the Netherlands and Denmark have contributed the most to Kyiv’s F-16 deterrent. Belgium and Norway have also pledged to supply Kyiv with the fighter aircraft, so Ukraine will soon possess over 90 F-16s and may be able to operate two squadrons by 2025. Notably, the Dutch F-16s are Viper Midlife Upgrade variants, which means they have additional precision-guided munitions certifications, better cockpit systems, more capable sensors, and software modernizations that are roughly aligned with the Block 50/52 standards for US-made F-16s. This is particularly important for Ukraine because the fighter aircraft derives much of its combat prowess from the weapons systems and external pods it is equipped with. Kyiv’s air deterrent may also be receiving a boost from Greece. Press sources have claimed that Athens, in retaliation for a Russian missile strike on Odesa during Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s visit to the city, had decided to send its decommissioned, older F-16 variants to Ukraine after refurbishing them in the United States. While this has not yet occurred, the Greek and Ukrainian governments have agreed on the provision of training and technical support for Ukraine’s F-16 fleet. Ukraine’s F-16s have had a mixed record in combat roles. They have been used primarily to shoot down Russian drones and cruise missiles. In August 2024 Russian aircraft downed a Ukrainian F-16 and killed its pilot. While some sources have reported that a Ukrainian F-16 downed a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber, that incident has never been confirmed. Regardless, protecting Ukrainian airspace will remain a key priority as Kyiv and its partners defend against continued Russian aggression. 4. Battlefield Assessment Last week saw a devastating rise in the number of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine. During the night of November 17, the Russian military unleashed a salvo of 42 loitering munitions and 102 missiles, its largest in many months. The attack targeted Ukraine’s energy network in major cities including Kyiv. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, Russia used one Zircon hypersonic missile and one Kinzhal aeroballistic missile in the barrage. The air component of the strike package involved nuclear-capable Tu-160 and Tu-95 strategic bombers and Tu-22M3 tactical bombers, along with other tactical military aviation assets. Ukrainian officials reported civilian casualties across the country in addition to the damage to energy facilities. Despite major political developments, only moderate changes in the battlefield geometry occurred last week. Augmented by North Korean forces, the Russian military pressed to recapture the territory it has lost to Ukrainian forces in Kursk before the Trump administration takes office. In the east, Ukraine’s lines of defense remained overstretched, allowing the Russian campaign to maintain a costly but steady pace. At other flashpoints, including Kurakhove, Pokrovsk, Chasiv Yar, Kupiansk, Klishchiivka, and Velyka Novosilka, Russian combat formations gained territory at the tactical level. Ukraine’s drone warfare prowess also continued to influence the conflict. Ukrainian drone strikes against Russian air defense assets increased, a trend worth monitoring. Russia also erected new defensive structures to protect the Kerch Bridge, which connects occupied Crimea to mainland Russia, from Ukrainian naval drones. A previous Hudson studyassessed Kyiv’s military options for striking this tactically and symbolically significant bridge.

Beijing Grows Anxious Over Internationalization Of Cross-Strait R...	By Yi-Chuan Chiu Four days after Taiwan’s National Day on 10 October 2024, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launched another large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, dubbed ‘Joint Sword-2024B’. While Taiwanese and US officials condemned these drills as ‘military provocations’, China’s justification included a phrase key to understanding Beijing’s anxiety about recent tensions in the Taiwan Strait— ‘the internationalisation of the Taiwan issue’. The term reflects Beijing and Taipei’s different views of the status quo and how this complicates cross-strait dynamics. ‘Internationalisation’ refers to framing China–Taiwan relations as a state-to-state relationship and an international dispute open to third-party intervention. Though the term originated in the 1950s, it resurfaced in Chinese official discourse when Beijing resisted comparisons between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. Such rejections reflect Beijing’s long-standing assertion that Taiwan belongs to China, is an unresolved issue of the Chinese Civil War and that solving the issue in any way is a domestic Chinese matter. Beijing’s disdain for internationalisation has been repeatedly quoted in its justification for launching PLA exercises protesting Taiwanese President Lai Ching-Te’s inauguration speech in May 2024 and National Day address in October. Lai’s speeches sought to frame cross-strait relations as state-to-state, which differed from the cautious approach of his predecessor, Tsai Ing-Wen. Unlike Tsai’s inaugural speeches in 2016 and 2020, Lai did not pledge to manage cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. These documents nominally commit to unification while also portraying cross-strait relations as an area-to-area relationship rather than a typical foreign relationship. Tsai referenced these legal texts to circumvent Beijing’s ‘One China Principle’ while seeking political common ground. She also referred to the governments in Beijing and Taipei as ‘both sides’ instead of using official country names. Lai’s citation of the ROC Constitution aimed to assert that Taiwan is an independent sovereign country and that ‘the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China are not subordinate to each other’. While Lai’s claim partly originated from Tsai’s 2021 National Day address, Beijing has criticised it as a new two-state theory and a disguisedpursuit of Taiwanese independence. Lai’s cross-strait approach indicates a priority for broadening domestic support rather than engaging Beijing. Most Taiwanese prefer a distinct Taiwanese identity without formally declaring independence. Lai intends to unify Taiwanese advocating for Taiwanese independence and those valuing the legacy of the ROC, which originated in mainland China. He has asserted that the 75-year-old People’s Republic of China (PRC) could not be the motherland of the 113-year-old ROC. Lai’s claim was condemned by Beijing as absurd but supported by 57 per cent of Taiwanese. Lai’s sharp rhetoric to carve Taiwan out of China not only reflects his self-defined pragmatismtowards Taiwanese independence, but also shows that Taiwanese politicians are constrained by the status quo preferred by the Taiwanese electorate. Most Taiwanese prefer to maintain de facto independence under the ROC banner and reframing cross-strait relations under an ambiguous One China concept — like the 1992 Consensus — is unpopular. Taiwan’s idea of the status quo differs from Beijing’s. Beijing’s ideal of the status quo stresses that most countries have de-recognised the ROC to formalise relations with the PRC. Therefore, Beijing finds it unacceptable for other countries to show diplomatic support for Taipei, especially when Taipei seeks to resist unification with Beijing. Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation benefits Beijing’s multifaceted campaign to coerce Taipei into unification and keep the Taiwan issue a domestic matter. This includes denying the Taiwan Strait’s status as international waters, increasing Chinese maritime patrols near Taiwanese territory and renewing efforts to reinterpret the United Nations’ resolution 2758. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, Beijing refused Tsai’s cross-strait engagement proposal — which lacked a direct mention of the 1992 Consensus — and has been unilaterally pushing for unificationunder the PRC. This has led to a cycle of action and reaction where both sides fear that ambiguity would either formalise continued separation or lead to forced unification. It is a difficult balancing act for Beijing to counter internationalisation while deterring Taiwanese independence with military means. On the one hand, Beijing aims to repel Western accusations of China as a systemic rival or revisionist power. Consequently, Chinese rhetoric has sought to characterise the One China Principle as an international norm integral to the post-World War II global order. On the other hand, massive PLA drills have the countereffect of drawing global attention to Taiwan. Other countries are likely uninterested in the contentious debate over the nuances of cross-strait terminology, but would be concerned about Beijing’s appetite for wielding its military power. The Chinese threat of war has so far deterred Taipei from abandoning the ROC name and establishing a Taiwanese republic. Yet it fails to dim Taiwanese aspirations for international participation and cannot force a Chinese identity on Taiwanese voters. Though cross-strait divergence is deepening, whether another Taiwan Strait crisis will happen depends on US actions. Unable to change Taiwanese public opinion in the short term, Beijing is more concerned about Washington amplifyinginternationalisation. Under President Joe Biden, former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit in August 2022 triggered massive PLA exercises but heightened Taiwan’s international visibility. Washington has also continuously raised international concerns about Taiwan Strait stability with US allies. With US President-elect Donald Trump’s isolationist and transactional style returning to the White House, it is uncertain whether Biden’s Taiwan approach will continue. Symbolic gestures that might trigger another military crisis and Beijing’s requests to change US language regarding Taiwan must be treated cautiously if the second Trump administration intends to keep the fragile cross-strait balance.

Trump 2.0 And The Indo-Pacific: Balancing Economic And Security I...	By Abhishek Sharma and Sayantan Haldar The United States (US) elections have come to a close, with Donald Trump emerging as the winner of the White House race. World-over, speculation is rife about the shifts in global geopolitics that the new Trump administration will likely usher in. Donald Trump’s previous stint in Washington as the 45th President of the United States (between 2017-2021) is helpful for analysts in drawing clues about the priorities and interests of his incoming administration. However, the state of the world has changed dramatically since Trump’s previous term in office and is likely to be reflected in his government’s actions going forward. While it is natural that the incoming administration will change how the US continues to engage with the world, in the Indo-Pacific context, the shifts are likely to be nuanced. On the economic front, the intensification of a contest against China may be on the horizon. In many ways, this will shape Washington’s security outlook in the Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacific legacy of Trump 1.0 In many ways, Donald Trump formalised America’s position on the Indo-Pacific. The previous Trump administration presided over America’s shift from the erstwhile Asia-Pacific towards a broader ‘Indo-Pacific’ focus. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, sought to anchor Washington’s defence, economic, and diplomatic ties with maritime Asia through the ‘Pivot’ strategy, later rechristened the ‘Rebalance to Asia’ strategy. Much after, world leaders began to grapple with the need to unify two important oceans—the Indian and Pacific oceans—into a single strategic theatre. In 2018, the Trump administration renamed the erstwhile Hawaii-based US Pacific Command (USPACOM) to the US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). While much of Trump’s campaign leading up to his previous administration was built on the need to check US spending on its allies and partners, the previous Trump administration had done well in gathering momentum towards building partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. This partly resulted from the imminent threat of China’s rise and the need to contain Beijing’s unilateral actions, which posed significant risks to American strategic interests in the region. Importantly, it was under the Trump administration, in 2017, that the Foreign Ministers of the four Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) countries—Australia, India, Japan and the US—held talks for the first time, which paved the way for the group to emerge as a formidable platform for governance in key domains of the Indo-Pacific. However, the strategic realities of the Indo-Pacific have undergone significant shifts in the last few years. This has also propelled new American partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. Apart from the Quad, three key partnerships guiding Washington’s outlook towards the Indo-Pacific are: The trilateral security cooperation with South Korea and Japan; Squad comprising US, Japan, Australia, and Philippines; and AUKUS comprising Australia, the United Kingdom (UK), and the US. While the US-Japan-South Korea trilateral seeks to address security challenges posed by North Korea, the Squad took shape recently in response to continued Chinese belligerence in the South China Sea, which often led to physical confrontations between various maritime services of China and the Philippines. Meanwhile, AUKUS emerged as a trilateral to deliver nuclear-powered submarines to Australia to deter potential conflict in an increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific. Given the shifting regional geopolitical landscape, the question of how the new Trump administration recalibrates its security and foreign policy is likely to be tied to the way Washington views the utility of its labyrinth partnerships in its pursuit of national interests. Strategic competition to strategic contestation The incoming Trump administration will inherit a robust security 'latticework' established by the Joe Biden administration in the Indo-Pacific. It is uncertain if the initiatives seeded and nurtured by Biden's ‘Diplomacy First’ approach will be continued with the same diplomatic rigour in the Trump administration. The answer to this will likely shape the trajectory of the US’s Indo-Pacific approach. The future of minilateral partnerships is likely to remain subject to the merits of Trump’s transactional diplomacy. It is quite evident that US foreign policy will be dominated by Trump’s priorities and interests. However, based on the Trump 2.0 cabinet appointments, a trade war with China appears certain. This will spill over into Washington’s approach towards the Indo-Pacific and the way US alliances and partnerships are sustained, which might play out adversely for the US-led security architecture. Due to the Trump administration’s great emphasis on economic issues related to China, security considerations will likely take a back seat. The ensuing economic sentiment in Washington is a factor that will heavily influence Trump 2.0 diplomacy. The trade war against China that started during his first tenure will likely resume and sharpen. In this context, the US’s traditional allies in the Indo-Pacific will need to recalibrate their strategies to ensure their security interests remain unhindered. Drawing from their experiences with the previous Trump administration, the election results seem to have spurred concerns about the future of a US-led security architecture in the Indo-Pacific, especially with regards to Washington’s allies’ place in the new American outlook towards the region. Consequently, whether the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will remain the focal point of US Indo-Pacific Strategy is still unclear. Moreover, the incoming of the new Trump administration might lead to the proliferation of more minilaterals in the Indo-Pacific, especially if Washington neglects or discontinues security cooperation, allowing emerging and middle powers to step up and cooperate. For instance, during Trump 1.0, Japan under Shinzo Abe took the initiative to continue engaging and reassuring regional stakeholders like the Southeast Asian countries, keeping initiatives like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) alive, while also managing China’s economic profile in the Indo-Pacific. Conclusion The incoming Trump administration is expected to be more hawkish towards China than Trump 1.0, shifting from Biden’s approach of managed competition to more open confrontation. This will lead to an intensified contest between the US and China in the Indo-Pacific, which, going forward, will also shape its Indo-Pacific policy and relations with regional stakeholders. Nonetheless, what remains to be seen is whether the US approach towards China will remain the dominant factor shaping its relations with regional allies in the Indo-Pacific, or whether earlier friction points of the Trump 1.0 era will re-emerge in the US foreign policy agenda. Either of the two scenarios will significantly alter the Indo-Pacific regional security and economic architecture. For instance, the US is expected to revert to its earlier mercantilist position on the economic front, so we will likely see the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) becoming dormant, giving more space to Beijing. However, on the security front, it is expected that Trump will continue to invest in minilateral security groupings like AUKUS and Quad. In the Indo-Pacific, a major concern will be whether the US will continue to seek a leadership role as it did during the Biden administration through a ‘relentless diplomacy’ approach, or whether it will be content with pursuing its ‘America First’ agenda in the Indo-Pacific.

Elderly Care Service Industry In China’s Silver Economy Has Enorm...	By Qian Xiaozhi In recent years, the Chinese authorities have been looking into the issue of health consumption in public health and livelihoods. The introduction and implementation of a series of policies, such as the Healthy China 2030 (HC 2030), have become powerful tools for promoting nationwide health. Such policies focus on the future development goals for the country's health industry, with particular attention to the market size and positioning of the 'big health' industry. The 'big health' industry is an extension of the health concept. It covers a wide range of human activities related to food, clothing, housing, transportation, aging, illness, and death. It spans the entire lifecycle, from disease prevention and diagnosis to treatment, care, and health management. According to the HC 2030, it is expected that by the year 2030, the market size of China's 'big health' industry will reach RMB 16 trillion where the sector has seen rapid growth since 2018. According to data from Intelligent Research Group, in 2023, the market size of China's big health industry grew to RMB 77.127 trillion; among which the health and elderly care sector accounted for RMB 31.357 trillion, making up more than 40% of the total. This indicates that with the increasing aging population, elderly care in China has become an important component of the big health industry. Furthermore, based on the forecasts of HC 2030 and the current estimates of the industry's scale, it is expected that in the next 6 to 7 years, the market size of China's big health industry will double. The rapid increase in market size is primarily due to the booming demand from current societal factors. A report from the World Bank highlights that chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases, have become China's top health threats, with the proportion of deaths from these diseases exceeding 80%, and the share of the national disease burden reaching 68.6%. Chronic diseases have now replaced infectious diseases as the primary health concern of the Chinese population. According to relevant data, the prevalence rate of chronic diseases among China's total population is 169.8 per 1,000, while among the elderly population is 540.3 per 1,000, which is 3.2 times the national average. As the elderly care sector expands, the related service industry plays an increasingly important role. Based on daily observations by researchers at ANBOUND, there are several areas within the Chinese elderly care service industry that may hold potential for further development.: 1. Specialized Medical Food: Dr. Wei Junmin, a chief physician at Beijing Hospital, noted that based on a nationwide survey, over 40% of individuals aged 60 and above face nutritional risks or malnutrition. In hospitals, more than half of elderly inpatients are at nutritional risk, and about 30% are malnourished. With substantial market potential, specialized medical food is expected to experience rapid growth. According to a report on market trends of medical food for 2023-2024 by iiMedia Research, the global market for specialized medical food grew from RMB 58.3 billion in 2014 to RMB 89.64 billion in 2022, and it is projected to exceed RMB 100 billion by 2027, reaching RMB 111.06 billion. The market size of China's specialized medical food industry grew from RMB 2.59 billion in 2016 to RMB 11.93 billion in 2022. iiMedia analysts believe that only 1.6% of malnourished patients in China consume specialized medical food, which is significantly lower than the 65% rate in the U.S. With factors such as population aging, increasing downstream demand, and the development of hospital nutrition departments, the specialized medical food sector is expected to see further growth due to its crucial role in clinical nutritional support. 2. Elderly care travels: In the criteria set by the China Silver Industry Association (CSIA), travel-based elderly care is defined as a lifestyle where elderly individuals travel and reside in towns outside their usual place of residence for more than 15 days, during which they enjoy various age-friendly services and continue their elderly care. According to a June 2023 report by the China Tourism Academy, it is estimated that by the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), the number of younger, healthier elderly individuals who travel frequently and have higher tourism consumption will exceed 100 million. Tourism revenue from elderly people in China is expected to reach RMB 1.14 trillion. The report indicates that the supply and demand in the elderly tourism industry in China are currently mismatched. It mentions that in 2019, the total expenditure of elderly tourists aged 65 and above in the country was RMB 319.78 billion, accounting for 5.6% of the total domestic tourism revenue of RMB 5.73 trillion. However, from the perspective of consumption structure, there is still significant potential for growth in the elderly tourism industry. Elderly tourists aged 65 and above in urban areas spent an average of RMB 1,209.20 per trip, which is only 74.3% of the average spending of RMB 1,626.50 of urban tourists. Meanwhile, elderly tourists in rural areas spent only RMB 847.50 per trip. The relatively low spending in elderly tourism can be attributed to the fact that the current tourism industry still primarily targets the middle-aged and young populations, with few products that cater to the needs of the elderly. There is insufficient integration of elderly tourism with industries in elements like culture, sports, and healthcare services. The silver communities often feel that the available travel products are not suitable for them, and the products they need are unavailable. However, behind this vast market is a pension service sector that is still in need of further development. 3. Rehabilitation Assistive Devices: According to data released by the World Health Organization, more than one billion people worldwide require some form of rehabilitation assistive devices, with the majority of these individuals being elderly or disabled. In China, the number of people in need of rehabilitation medical services has already exceeded 100 million. As the aging population issue intensifies and the likelihood of elderly people suffering from various health conditions gradually increases, this number is expected to continue rising. Data from Zhiyanzhan Industry Research Institute reveals that in 2019, the sales revenue from rehabilitation assistive device rental services in the Chinese market was RMB 20 million, and it is predicted that by 2030, this figure will rise to RMB 1.432 billion. As the aging population continues to increase in China, the imbalance between supply and demand in the rehabilitation assistive devices market is becoming particularly pronounced. According to relevant data, the proportion of people who have access to assistive device services has not yet surpassed 10% of the total population's demand. One reason for this is that China's elderly care industry started relatively late, and the types of rehabilitation devices are still rather limited. Compared to developed countries, the supply of high-quality rehabilitation assistive devices is clearly lagging behind. Among these factors, the insufficient variety of products is undoubtedly a key factor contributing to the scarcity of high-quality supply resources. Additionally, the technology of China's rehabilitation assistive products is generally low, and product quality varies significantly. In the current market environment, the production of low-cost products far exceeds demand, while the demand for high-quality products remains unmet and is mainly reliant on imports. Part of the reason for this is China's previous neglect of this industry, as well as a severe lack of investment in research and development. Additionally, the production model is relatively outdated. The government has also begun to pay attention to this issue. In 2024, China's State Council issued a policy document on promoting a 'silver economy to improve the well-being of the elderly.' It called for the improvement of the rehabilitation assistive devices industry, upgrading functional compensation devices such as hearing aids, orthotics, canes, and prosthetics, and enhancing life care products such as smart wheelchairs, transfer machines, and rehabilitation nursing beds. Crucially, in areas such as specialized medical foods, elderly care tourism, and rehabilitation assistive devices in China, the supporting policies and industrial infrastructure are underdeveloped. As elderly care services increasingly become a vital component of the health and silver sector, these industries present significant opportunities for further development and investment. Final analysis conclusion: As the aging population in China continues to grow, health-oriented elderly care has become a prevailing trend within the broader health industry. Within this context, the importance of elderly care services is becoming increasingly prominent. However, China remains significantly behind in several sectors, including specialized medical foods, elderly care tourism, and rehabilitation assistive devices. These industries present considerable potential for further development.

Distress In Commercial Real Estate Bonds Hit All-Time High – Anal...	By Artis Shepherd Commercial real estate continues to suffer despite the Federal Reserve’s attempt at ameliorating the capital markets with a 50-basis point rate cut in September. The pain is especially apparent in the so-called 'CRE-CLO' bond market. CRE-CLO bonds are packaged commercial real estate mortgages comprising short-term floating rate loans. These bridge loans were recently, and most notably, used to facilitate the biggest apartment investment bubble in history, but were also used in financing other commercial real estate sectors including office, retail, hotel, industrial, and self-storage. Most of the current batch of bridge loans originated in the 2020-2022 period—when benchmark rates were near zero and commercial real estate prices were peaking—and carried maturities of three to five years. Benchmark rates are now much higher, prices much lower, and property performance far worse than anticipated. Thus, a wall of maturities is staring borrowers, lenders, and bondholders in the face, all while underlying property performance disappoints. Despite attempts by lenders to extend and pretend—kicking the can down the road in the short term to avoid defaults until the Federal Reserve lowers rates enough to bail them out—their delusions of reprieve may be fading fast. Apartment Investors Play Checkers Instead of Chess At the end of Q3, the distress rate for CRE-CLO loans across all commercial real estate sectors reached 13.1 percent, an all-time high. Distress in this instance is defined as any loan reported 30 days or more delinquent, past the maturity date, in special servicing (typically due to a drop in occupancy or a failure to meet certain performance criteria), or any combination thereof. Figure 1 While roughly one in seven loans meets these criteria, the weakness is concentrated in two or three sectors. Unsurprisingly, office properties have the highest rate of distress, with nearly one in five CRE-CLO office loans experiencing current distress. This is to be expected after the covid panic of 2020, subsequent to which various 'work-from-home' directives essentially made the office market obsolete. For similar reasons, distress is also high in the retail segment, as all but the most well-heeled retailers were forced under by the maniacal and criminal government edicts of the time. However, the real story here is in the apartment, or multifamily, sector. Seen in Figure 1, the distress rate for apartments touched 16.4 percent in August. An astonishing number, indicating that one in six apartment bridge loans were distressed. The improvement to 13.7 percent shown for September is seasonal, as renters settle in at the start of the school year. While this picture is bad enough, the reality under the surface is far worse. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, using Q2 data from MSCI, the batch of currently distressed apartment bridge loans comprise roughly $14 billion in total loans, but there exists an additional $81 billion in potentially distressed loans. MSCI categorizes loans as 'potentially distressed' if they have seen delinquent payments, forbearance (when the lender lets interest payments accrue rather than taking a default action), or where key performance metrics like occupancy and net operating income are dangerously low. Figure 2 The arithmetically-aware will note that if the $14 billion of currently distressed apartment bridge loans comprise a roughly 14 percent distress rate at the end of Q2 (as shown in Figure 1) and there are an additional $81 billion in potentially distressed loans not yet categorized as 'currently distressed' (as shown in Figure 2), then MSCI data implies that 95 percent of all apartment bridge loans are either currently distressed or in imminent danger of distress. While astounding, this level of distress will come as no surprise to veterans of the apartment market. In the 2020-22 period, bridge loans of this variety were ubiquitous above a certain minimum loan size. And, because of the extreme and reckless nature of money printing undertaken by the Federal Reserve during this time—when interest rates were effectively zero—lenders underwrote property acquisitions with a 1.0x debt service coverage ratio ('DSCR'), meaning the initial net operating income of the property was projected to just cover interest payments, with nothing left over. Bridge loan interest rates floated at a spread (typically around 350 basis points, or 3.5 percent) to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), which was essentially 0 percent until mid-2022. Because of the 1.0x DSCR standard, a property acquired during this period that had net operating income of $1 million would have also had interest payments of $1 million at the then-prevailing interest rate of 3.5 percent. SOFR is now 4.9 percent, indicating a total interest rate of 8.4 percent (SOFR + 3.5 percent spread). This same property now has interest payments of $2.4 million while net operating income is unlikely to have increased to any significant extent, if at all. Insurance and property tax increases in particular have damaged apartment profitability while rent increases have been difficult to execute in the face of stagnating real wages. By the same token, absurdly optimistic renovation plans have been impossible in the face of cash flows increasingly shunted towards paying interest. The Amazing Disappearing Rate Cut The high amount of potential distress in CRE-CLO bonds, and the loans that underlie them, indicate an expectation on the part of lenders that help is coming in the form of lower interest rates. After all, capital markets have become used to being bailed out by the Federal Reserve, all but demanding that the taxpayer—not they—be held responsible for their poor decisions. Nevertheless, the Fed’s recent rate cut is proving not to be the magic bullet on which lenders relied. By August of this year, futures markets had fully priced in a 25-50 basis point Fed rate cut in September, and were expecting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December. This expectation for the Fed Funds Rate carried over into Treasury yields, a key benchmark for the commercial real estate industry. Particularly important in the case of distressed bridge loans since any hopes of refinancing are placed not on more bridge loans—which are now much less pervasive—but on the fixed-rate agency market comprising Fannie- and Freddie-backed apartment loans, which prices loans off a spread to treasuries. At the beginning of August, as markets priced in 75-100 bps of Fed rate cuts by year-end, 10-year Treasury yields reacted accordingly, dropping from 4.30 percent in late July (they had been 4.70 percent in April) to 3.65 percent in the middle of September. As of early November, most of that move had been erased—with yields back near 4.30 percent—roughly where they were prior to market pricing in this year’s Fed rate cuts. Fear and Trembling Undeniably, participants in the commercial real estate market—apartment bridge lenders in particular—are relying on loose monetary policy for their immediate salvation. They may get their wish. While Treasury rates have moved stubbornly higher, market forces only mean so much if the Fed decides to supplement rate cuts with purchases of treasuries, driving yields lower—another round of quantitative easing. Nevertheless, to the extent they’re allowed to be heard, market signals are unmistakable. A regime that can’t stop spending and continues to appropriate the property of its citizens through inflation will provide upward pressure on Treasury yields, all else equal. In a free market context, the rent-seekers that comprise the commercial real estate market will have to work out their own salvation.

The Counter-Insurgency Is ‘On’ – Against Trump’s ‘Storm’ – OpEd	The Deep State whispered to Trump: ‘You cannot withstand the storm’. Trump whispered back: 'I am the storm'. The war is on. The Deep State has launched a war of disruption to disable Trump’s ‘storm’. This week’s ATACM strike was but one part to an inter-agency counter-insurgency – a political strike directed at Trump; so too are all the inter-agency false narratives attributed to the Trump camp; and so too, the escalating provocations directed at Iran. Be assured the Five Eyes are full participants in the counter-insurgency. Macron and Starmer openly conspired together in Paris ahead of the U.S. announcement to promote the ATACMS strike. The inter-agency grandees clearly are very fearful. They must worry that Trump may expose the ‘Russia Hoax’ (that Trump in 2016 was a Russian ‘asset’) and put them in jeopardy. But Trump understands what’s afoot: 'We need peace without delay … The foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict. The greatest threat to Western civilization today is not Russia. It’s probably more than anything else ourselves… There must be a complete commitment to dismantling the entire Globalist Neo-con establishment that is perpetually dragging us into endless wars, pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad while they turn us into a Third World country and a Third World dictatorship right here at home. The State Department, the Defense bureaucracy, the intelligence services and all of the rest need to be completely overhauled and reconstituted. To fire the Deep Staters and put America first – we have to put America First'. Whilst the long-range ATACM launch on ‘deep Russian pre-2014 territory’ is no game-changer – it will not change the course of the war (ATACMS regularly are – at 90% – downed by Russian Air Defences); the salience of this act however, is not strategic; rather, it lies with the crossing into the realm of direct NATO attacks on Russia. Colonel Doug MacGregor reports that two sources are telling him that 'Russian nuclear rocket forces are on full alert. They are at the highest level of readiness ever achieved. It suggests that Russia has taken this crossing of the line very seriously'. Yes, it was a provocation, and President Putin will respond appropriately. He has to – but not necessarily through nuclear escalation. Why? Because the war in Ukraine is moving rapidly in his direction, with Russian forces closing-in on the Dnieper east bank. Effectively, facts on the ground will be the outcome determinant, leaving little point to external mediation. But more than just a dangerous provocation aimed at Russia, the ATACM and Storm Shadow attacks represent an attempt to turn foreign policy – literally – on its head. Instead of policy being aimed directly at a rising foreign adversary threatening U.S. hegemony, it is being transformed into a loaded weapon locked onto America’s domestic war. It is aimed specifically at Trump – to ‘hog tie’ him in, and to divert his attention to wars that he does not want. Logic suggests that Trump would want to keep clear of Netanyahu’s scheming for a war against Iran. But the ‘Israel Firsters’ and the Lobby (as Professor Jeffrey Sachs argues) long have had effective control over Congress and the U.S. military – more than does the President. Explains Sachs: 'Because the Zionist Lobby is so powerful, Netanyahu basically has had control over the Pentagon to fight wars on behalf of Israeli extremism. The war in Iraq in 2003 was a Netanyahu War. The attempt to overthrow Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the overthrow of Moamar Gaddafi – All were ‘Netanyahu Wars’'. The important point is that Netanyahu can ‘do what he does’ because it was always planned this way – a plan that has been 50 years in execution. The ‘Israel First’ strategy was fully embraced by Scoop Jackson (a two-times Presidential candidate). And just so the policy could not be rolled back, Scoop insisted on Zionists staffing the State Department, and that neo-cons and Zionists hold the reins at the NSC. That same pattern continues until today. At bottom lies the ultimate boondoggle by which the political class of both U.S. parties become wealthy and afford the campaign costs of remaining legislators: 'It’s quite a dandy deal that the Israel Lobby or the Zionist Lobby puts in, say, a hundred million dollars into campaigns and it gets trillions out –trillions, not billions, trillions out [in government] expenditures. And so, when Netanyahu speaks, it’s bizarre to me, but it is not Trump who is appointing or naming [those ‘Israel Firsters’ who are part of his Team, but Netanyahu]', Sachs says. When Netanyahu describes Trump’s ‘Israel First’ nominations as his ‘dream U.S. team’, the explanation is not difficult to see. On the one hand, Trump has a ‘Revolution’ to conduct in America and wants his nominations to office approved. And, on the other, Netanyahu has a further war he wants the U.S. to fight for him. 'The ‘Big Ugly’ was always a description of the battle that few understood',another commentator notes: 'The Senate is factually the core of republican opposition to MAGA and President Trump. The visible battle … consumes the most attention. However, it is the less-visible battle against the entrenched ideological Republicans that proves to be the hardest'. 'The Republicans in the upper chamber will not relinquish power easily. They have a multitude of weapons to use against the (Trump) insurgency … We are seeing this play out now in the alignment of Republican Senators who stand in opposition to Trump’s nomination of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, [as] this recent report[explains]'. 'The basic outline is that the senate leadership will reluctantly support Matt Gaetz for Main Justice, where ‘support’ means they will not directly oppose; in exchange for the nomination of FBI Director Mike Rogers [a co-founder of the ‘Never Trump’ group] to defend inter-agency interests at FBI'. The prospective Republican Senate Leader, John Thune, will play his cards carefully in order to extract maximum damage. He has leverage by trying to connect Trump to Netanyahu’s carnage in the region. Thune, whilst announcing huge quantities of weapons for Israel, said: 'To Our Allies in Israel, and to the Jewish People Around the world, my message to you is this: Reinforcements are on the way. In six weeks, Republicans will reclaim the Senate Majority, and we will make clear that the United States Congress stands squarely In Israel’s Corner'. Trump will need to play his cards carefully, too. Since, for his purposes, the absolute priority are his two domestic wars: First, 'dismantling the entire Globalist Neocon Establishment', and secondly, ending the out-of-control government expenditure that has bloated the Deep State boondoggle and turned the U.S. real economy into a shadow of its former self. Trump needs those radical reform nominations to pass, even if he has to sacrifice one or two to secure Senate approval for the others. The Israel First nominees, needless to add, will be approved seamlessly. Of the two ‘entanglement’ threats to Trump’s reform agenda, Russian escalation is the lesser of the two. The Ukraine war is motoring steadily towards some form of dénoument. One that works for Russia. Putin is in the driving seat, and does not need a major war with NATO. Nor does Putin need Trump’s ‘art of the deal’. A resolution of some sort will occur without him. However, Trump’s role will be important subsequently to define a new border between the security interests of the Atlanticists and those of the Asian heartland (including China and Iran). The other putative war – Iran – is the more dangerous to Trump. Jewish political influence and the Lobby has taken the U.S. into multiple disastrous wars before. And now, Netanyahu desperately needs a war and he is not alone. Much of Israel is clamouring for war that would end ‘all the fronts’ facing it. There is a profound conviction in this prospect as the solution and the ‘Great Victory’ that Netanyahu and Israel so desperately need. The ground has been dug-over, both by propaganda that Iran’s nuclear programme is ‘staggeringly vulnerable’ (which it isn’t), and by the media’s onslaught that replays the meme that to attack Iran now represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, with Hizbullah and Hamas already weakened. War with Iran – totally erroneously – is thus being sold as an ‘easy war’. There is an unshakeable certitude that it must be so. ‘We are strong, and Iran is weak’. Who will roll-back the Israel Firsters? They have the momentum and the fervour. A war against Iran will fare badly for Israel and the U.S. The wide ramifications likely will precipitate precisely the severe financial and market crisis that could derail Trump’s ‘Storm’.

Fencing The Ocean: Australia’s Social Media Safety Bill – OpEd	The Australian government is being run ragged in various quarters. When ragged, such a beast is bound to seek a distraction. And what better than finding a vulnerable group, preferably children, to feel outraged and noble about? The Albanese government, armed such problematic instruments as South Australia’s Children (Social Media Safety) Bill 2024, which will fine social media companies refusing to exclude children under the age of 14 from using their platforms, and a report by former High Court Chief Justice Robert French on the feasibility of such a move, is confident of restricting the use of social media by children across the country by imposing an age limit. On November 21, the government boastfully declared in a media release that it had officially 'introduced world-leading legislation to enforce a minimum age of 16 years for social media.' The proposed legislation, known as the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024, is supposedly going to 'deliver greater protections for young Australians during critical stages of their development.' The proposed legislation made something of an international splash. NBC News, for instance, called the bill 'one of the toughest in the world', failing to note its absence of muscle. To that end, it remains thin on detail. These laws constitute yet another effort to concentrate power and responsibilities best held by the citizenry in the hands of a bureaucratic-political class governed by paranoia and procedure. They are also intended to place the onus on social media platforms to place restrictions upon those under 16 years of age from having accounts. The government openly admits as much, seemingly treating parents as irresponsible and weak (their consent in this is irrelevant), and children as permanently threatened by spoliation. 'The law places the onus on social media platforms – not parents or young people – to take reasonable steps to ensure these protections are in place.' If the platforms do not comply, they risk fines of up to A$49.5 million. As for the contentious matter of privacy, the prime minister and his communications minister are adamant. 'It will contain robust privacy provisions, including requiring the platforms to ringfence and destroy any information collected to safeguard the personal information of all Australians.' The drafters of the bill have also taken liberties on what is deemed appropriate to access. As the media release mentions, Australia’s youth will still 'have continued access to messaging and online gaming, as well as access to services which are health and education related, like Headspace, Kids Helpline, and Google Classroom, and YouTube.' This daft regime is based on the premise it will survive circumvention. Children, through guile and instinctive perseverance, will always find a way to access forbidden fruit. Indeed, as the Digital Industry Group Inc says, this '20th Century response to 21st Century challenges' may well steer children into 'dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet'. In May, documents uncovered under Freedom of Information by Guardian Australia identified that government wonks in the communications department were wondering if such a scheme was even viable. A document casting a sceptical eye over the use of age assurance technology was unequivocal: 'No countries have implemented an age verification mandate without issue.' Legal challenges have been launched in France and Germany against such measures. Circumvention has become a feature in various US states doing the same, using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). While this proposed legislation will prove ineffectual in achieving its intended purpose – here, protecting the prelapsarian state of childhood from ruin at the hands of wicked digital platforms – it will also leave the apparatus of hefty regulation. One can hardly take remarks coming from the absurdly named office of the eSafety Commissioner, currently occupied by the authoritarian-minded Julie Inman Grant, seriously in stating that 'regulators like eSafety have to be nimble.' Restrictions, prohibitions, bans and censorship regimes are, in their implementation, never nimble. For all that, even Inman Grant has reservations about some of the government’s assumptions, notably on the alleged link between social media and mental harm. The evidence for such a claim, she told BBC Radio 5 Live, 'is not settled at all'. Indeed, certain vulnerable groups – she mentions LGBTQ+ and First Nations cohorts in particular – 'feel more themselves online than they do in the real world'. Why not, she suggests, teach children to use online platforms more safely? Children, she analogises, should be taught how to swim, rather than being banned from swimming itself. Instruct the young to swim; don’t ringfence the sea. Rather appositely, Lucas Lane, at 15 something of an entrepreneur selling boys nail polish via the online business Glossy Boys, told the BBC that the proposed ban 'destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen.' Already holed without even getting out of port, this bill will serve another, insidious purpose. While easily dismissed as having a stunted moral conscience, Elon Musk, who owns X Corp, is hard to fault in having certain suspicions about these draft rules. 'Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the internet by all Australians,' he wrote to a post from Albanese. One, unfortunately, among several.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuUH2Ry01l1K7	2024-11-22T16:50:13-08:00	
Surviving The New Trump Era – OpEd	Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election was surprising in a number of ways. He won every swing state as well as the popular vote, which a Republican candidate hadn’t done in two decades. He led his party to a congressional sweep, with the Republicans maintaining control of the House of Representatives and seizing a majority in the Senate. And he benefited from an unexpectedly large shift in votes among Latino and African-American men. In 2016, when Hilary Clinton won the popular vote by a significant margin but lost the Electoral College, anti-Trump forces could plausibly argue that most of the country opposed the new president. This time around, a very slim plurality of voters had no problem putting back into the White House a convicted felon who supported efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. In 2016, Trump himself was surprised by his own victory, and his team was ill-prepared to take power. In 2024, the Trump team is ready to hit the ground running on day one. It has already made some of the most extreme choices in U.S. history for the top positions in U.S. government: serial rule-breaker Matt Gaetz for attorney general, conspiracy theorist Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, right-wing TV host Pete Hegseth to head up the Pentagon, and extremist Stephen Miller to oversee immigration. This time around, the conservative establishment has a detailed game plan for the administration—Project 2025—that will guide Trump and his team. A new conservative thinktank in Washington, DC, the America First Policy Institute, will also be shaping the administration’s agenda. The Biden administration is scrambling to preserve some of the achievements that the Trump team plans to destroy, particularly around clean energy. Federal employees are fearful that they will lose their jobs in Trump’s promised attacks on the 'deep state.' Prominent anti-Trumpers are worried about the retribution that the former and future president has vowed to pursue. A demoralized Democratic Party is busy trying to figure out why it lost so badly in the elections. The next four years promise to be chaotic, vengeful, and dangerous. U.S. democracy is certainly in peril. The international rule of law will likely sustain numerous challenges, as it has already from Russia and Israel. And the planet itself, thanks to the climate denier returning to the White House, faces the prospect of a big step backward. What can be done to prevent the new Trump administration from doing its worst? At the global level, many countries will step into the vacuum created by U.S. withdrawal—from the Paris agreement, the effort to supply Ukraine, and various global human rights institutions. European powers will likely step up their assistance to Ukraine if the Trump administration ends all military support for the besieged country. Europe, too, will continue to take the lead in terms of a clean energy transition, but China, Brazil, and India are also producing a growing amount of electricity from renewable sources. Europe, however, is divided, with a number of far-right leaders who are thrilled to have a U.S. leader like Trump pushing for change from the outside. And the authoritarian leaders of other countries—Russia, China, Turkey—will happily take the U.S. side in eroding human rights norms and institutions. Inside the United States, the greatest resistance will come from the states. These states controlled by Democrats—California, Washington, Massachusetts—are already preparing to work together to block Trump from executing his extremist agenda. This resistance will likely take the form of filing suits that tangle up the new administration in court. During Trump’s first term, states joining together to stymie Trump succeeded in 94 cases. Unfortunately, thanks to all of Trump’s judicial appointees in his first term, these legal challenges will face longer odds. States also have considerable authority to set policy. For instance, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, a number of states preserved access to abortion services through court rulings, legislative policy, or popular referenda. In the case of Trump’s determination to proceed with mass deportations, some Democratic governors have already said that they will not allow state police to assist federal authorities with the removals. Democrat-led states will do their best to create islands of sanctuary against the overreach of federal authorities. NGOs and social movements will also mount resistance. A women’s march in Washington, DC just after Trump’s inauguration in 2017 demonstrated the depth and breadth of anger at the new president’s attitudes and proposed policies toward women. A comparable march is planned for January 2025. In addition to using the courts to stop or delay Trump policies, the resistance is organizing to push the Democratic Party toward economic populism. Harris lost a lot of working-class voters. As Maurice Mitchell of the Working Families Party puts it, 'Donald Trump has no solutions to address the needs of working-class people in this country. And we know that when he tries to implement his agenda of more tax cuts for billionaires, gutting health care, deporting millions, and supporting war crimes with public dollars, people will rise up.' The goal of these progressives is to highlight the economic costs of Trump’s early moves—mass deportations, tariffs, corporate tax cuts—to build momentum to win the 2016 midterm elections. Resistance will be much easier if the Democrats control at least one chamber of Congress. A number of key movements exploded during Trump’s first term: the Sunrise Movement around climate change began just a couple months after Trump’s inauguration, #MeToo went viral in October 2017, #BlackLivesMatter went global after police killed George Floyd in May 2020. Inevitably, after the despondency of the election fades and the outrage at Trump’s actual policies explodes, new movements will emerge to mobilize public anger. The centrists in the Democratic Party failed in the last election because they refused to embrace the kind of economic populism that the Republicans, traditionally the party of the rich, began to cultivate under Trump. The challenge for the Democrats will be negotiate between the two progressive parts of the party—the cultural left and the economic left. Although these parts often overlap, the party failed to emphasize the latter in the last election, which could have appealed to so many voters who ended up pulling the lever for Trump because of the rising cost of food and rent. In the seven stages of grief, progressives are wallowing right now in the first three stages of shock, denial, and anger. It would be a mistake to get stuck in the seventh and final stage of acceptance. When Trump’s policies begin to bite, the anger will return and, with it, a new determined resistance.

A US Federal Shield Law Is Needed To Protect The Press – OpEd	Like it or not, the Constitution’s First Amendment gives the media special protection in the American republic. That amendment says, 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press.' With one of the recent presidential candidates unconstitutionally threatening to shut down media outlets or take away their (non-existent) licenses when they say or do something he doesn’t like, it is not hard to imagine him in office trying to ferret out government whistleblowers by applying legal coercion to force members of the press to cough up their sources. In fact, this candidate, when he was president previously, did precisely that, as did his predecessor from the opposite party to an even greater extent. Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have laws or state court rulings that shield reporters from such government coercion. Despite the special protection of the media by the Constitution at the national level, no similar federal law exists to provide the same safeguard. Thus, federal Circuit Courts of Appeals rulings have had to give some stopgap protection. Why is a federal shield law for reporters needed? If the government cannot keep its essential information under wraps, then the press should be free to publish it for public inspection. However, the government doesn’t see it that way, and it has plenty of coercive legal power to subpoena reporters of leaked information to divulge their sources so that any government leaker can be prosecuted. And legally, if reporters gather or transmit vaguely defined 'national defense information' from leakers or whistleblowers, the journalists can risk being prosecuted criminally through the Espionage Act of 1917; only tradition has circumscribed the prosecution of reporters under the law. Of course, the general lack of protection for reporters’ sources dissuades such federal whistleblowers from talking to reporters about wrongdoing or corruption in government. Even in a republic, the public should be aware that plenty of corruption and skullduggery exist in government. A proposed federal reporters’ shield law, the PRESS (Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying) Act, is going through Congress and passed by the House of Representatives unanimously twice (an unusual feat of consensus in today’s polarized political world). However, the bill has been opposed in the Senate by a small group of members because it would encourage leaks of national security and law enforcement information. Yet, the bill has exceptions to force reporters to divulge sources to prevent any acts of terrorism or imminent violence and does not provide immunity to reporters who commit illegal acts to obtain information (such as hacking, etc.). Also, it is widely acknowledged that much overclassification exists in information classified by the feds for 'national security' reasons and that classification can be flagrantly abused to hide information that is embarrassing to the government. Finally, the few senators objecting to the bill claim to be constitutional textualists and originalists. Yet, the First Amendment’s prohibition on abridging the freedom of the press mentions no exception for 'national security.' Besides, the government has so much coercive power that it can often find leakers and prosecute them without intimidating reporters to divulge their sources. With any federal shield law, it may seem that reporters have been designated as a special class of citizens, but the First Amendment already realizes that keeping a vibrant republic demands special protections to maintain a free press. (In the internet era, however, any conception of journalists may need to be widened to include new forms of the profession.) And those safeguards for the press may be especially needed if a candidate is elected who parrots Joseph Stalin by deeming the press 'an enemy of the people' and regularly threatens media outlets with retribution and coercion.

Democrats Lost By Overly Orchestrating Anti-Trump Efforts – OpEd	Nancy Pelosi got blamed for top-down 'orchestration,' but the Cabal was broader than that The primary reasons voters elected Donald Trump over Kamala Harris and chose a Republican Congress were Joe Biden and the Democrats' miserable handling of the economy, immigration and foreign policy – and their embrace of far-left 'woke' polices, like sex-change operations for prisoners and other 'transgender rights.' However, the Democrat 'strategy' of hitting Trump with multiple indictments, tagging him and his supporters as 'existential threats to democracy,' and scaring women over abortion rights after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision may also have backfired, because these efforts were really designed to deflect attention from the harmful impacts of Biden's bad policies and actions. Topping it off, when he was pushed off the ticket for Vice President Kamala Harris in July, many voters may have smelled a rat. In essence, all of this was masterminded by a few political chieftains, notably former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), House Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and probably the Obamas, Clintons and their 'strategists.' Indeed, on MSNBC November 9, former Harris spokesperson and one-time Bernie Sanders operative Symone Sanders-Townsend (no relation to the senator), mouthed off against Pelosi, saying she 'orchestrated the very public demise of the president. And thank God for Joe Biden, that he came out and, yes, endorsed his VP. Pelosi is known for being 'calculated,' she went on to say, but 'where is her calculator now?' The key words here are 'orchestration' and 'calculating.' One could say 'None dare call it conspiracy,' or resurrect then-First Lady Hillary Clinton's 1998 phrase 'vast right-wing conspiracy' that 'has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.' Ms. Clinton was denounced for calling it a 'conspiracy.' In reality, a group of conservative activists and publications did continue an 'opposition research' campaign against President Bill Clinton from the day he was elected in 1992, to persuade Congress and courts to investigate him, impeach him and undermine his presidency. It didn't really work. Like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton was impeached, but he resurrected himself, while Hillary went on to become a US Senator from New York and Secretary of State – and came close to defeating Trump for president in 2016. The vast-left wing orchestration against Trump, however, was much more intricate, extensive and orchestrated than what conservatives used to tarnish Clinton. For example: * Advancing the phony 'Russiagate' scandal, at the highest levels of government * Supporting and glorifying the 'mostly peaceful' 'Resistance' against the Trump presidency * Instigating the 2019 House impeachment * Demanding school and business lockdowns during the Covid pandemic, to hurt the economy and President Trump * Supporting and capitalizing on the George Floyd riots * Perpetuating 'January 6' investigations, hearings, indictments and media coverage * Promoting fear and hysteria following the Dobbs decision and various state limitations on abortion * Pushing challengers out of the 2020 primaries to anoint Joe Biden (South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's 'masterstroke') * Preventing a competitive 2024 primary against Biden * Holding a Biden-Trump debate after primaries had ended, to see how President Biden would perform – and then forcing him off the ticket because he bombed * Coronating Kamala Harris after Biden was ousted Many are convinced that all these schemes were orchestrated by the Cabal of Pelosi, Schumer, the Obamas, the Clintons, and their strategists. Perhaps they wanted Biden to be the 2020 nominee, instead of independent-minded people like Senators Amy Klobuchar or Elizabeth Warren, or outsiders like Pete Buttigieg or Michael Bloomberg, because they knew they could manipulate Biden more easily. However, Joe Biden was never a leader in the US Senate; he was a follower. He does little thinking for himself, but makes decisions based on the advice of bureaucrats, political aides and special interests. He largely approved all the big-spending legislation and regulatory initiatives the Democrats and his Obama-holdover aides wanted when they regained control of Congress after 2020. And he opened the nation's borders to salve the bleeding hearts of his policy wonks. 'Joe Biden is nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical socialists,' former Vice President Mike Pence warned in 2020. In the end, that radicalism doomed the Democrats in 2024. In anointing Biden 'The Nominee' during the 2020 primaries, octogenarians Clyburn and Pelosi looked over Biden's eroding cognitive abilities. When he inevitably became a liability to the Democratic cause, they orchestrated his departure from the ticket for the younger Harris. They also engaged in incessant 'lawfare,' Trump indictments and January-6 investigations. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested the Democrats should have focused 'on one or two' charges against Trump, not four, and the indictments 'will backfire on the Left.' But The Cabal apparently wanted to extend the Trump-tarnishing so that there would be no trial before the GOP nominating process, thereby giving Republicans little opportunity to nominate someone else. Prolonging the 1/6 congressional investigation into the 2022 elections was an effort to tarnish not just Trump, but his supporters. Biden's unforgivable September 2022 speech in Philadelphia, when he attacked 'MAGA Republicans' for being disloyal to America, was part and parcel of this effort The media covered up the Cabal's intrigues. Anyone who watches CNN or MSNBC has seen how Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin, Pelosi, Clyburn and other leading Democrats are treated with kid gloves. The media hated Trump for calling them 'fake news' and colluded with the Democrats nearly every step of the way. It's unlikely that Symone Sanders-Townsend will come clean on all of this, though our nation would benefit greatly from the disinfecting sunshine she could provide. Regardless, it seems highly unlikely that the Democrats can change their stripes, because their base and big donors have gone Loony-Left. The Cabal probably thought throwing all those indictments and civil penalties at Trump would make him crack and cop a plea with the prosecutors. But Trump had the money and backbone to slug it out. He also had excellent lawyers, who mucked up the lawfare wheels. Essentially, he ran the clock out on the Democrats. There's a lesson here about being 'overzealous' in politics. Jerome Lawrence coauthored the 1955 play (and 1960 film) 'Inherit the Wind,' which examined extremism in 'the Scopes monkey trial,' as a metaphor for the McCarthy investigations. Lawrence wrote: 'Is it possible to be overzealous, to destroy that which you hope to save – so that nothing is left but emptiness?' With Trump wining a near landslide despite the criminal cases – and taking the Congress – it seems all the Democrat orchestrations left them nothing but emptiness.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuXBLrZUSNRzZ	2024-11-22T16:34:40-08:00	
Saudi Arabia: Public Investment Fund Linked To Abuses, Says HRW	Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), has facilitated and benefited from human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch said in a report. The 95-page report, 'The Man Who Bought the World: Rights Abuses Linked to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Its Chairman, Mohammad bin Salman,' found that Saudi Arabia’s vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is effectively controlled by one person, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Human Rights Watch found that the crown prince wields this enormous economic power in a largely arbitrary and highly personalized manner rather than for the Saudi people’s benefit and that the PIF is used to whitewash the Saudi government’s abuses. 'Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has unchecked control over the country’s nearly trillion dollar Public Investment Fund,' said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'The crown prince has used the Saudi sovereign wealth fund’s economic power to commit serious human rights violations and whitewash the reputational harm from these abuses.' Sovereign wealth funds are funds accumulated by a government, often consisting of government revenue, trade surpluses, and reserves, and are invested domestically and abroad. Many have been built on oil wealth. The report is based on a review of government statements, Saudi court documents; Saudi laws and government decrees; documents released during court proceedings in Canada and the United States; company records and reports; investigations and analyses by journalists financial experts, and academics; as well as interviews with Saudi activists and dissidents, journalists, experts, and lawyers with long experience in Saudi Arabia. The PIF has benefited directly from serious human rights abuses linked to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS. This includes the crown prince’s 2017 'anti-corruption' crackdown that consisted of arbitrary detentions, abusive treatment of detainees, and the extortion of property from Saudi Arabia’s elite. The PIF has facilitated serious human rights violations linked to MBS through companies it owns and controls, such as the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the anti-corruption crackdown. Sky Prime Aviation, one of the companies transferred to the PIF during the crackdown, owned the two planes used in 2018 by Saudi agents to travel to Istanbul, where they murdered Khashoggi. MBS overhauled the PIF’s governance framework and concentrated an immense degree of control and oversight of the fund into his own hands, enabling him to unilaterally direct enormous sums of state wealth to megaprojects that do little to realize economic, social, or cultural rights in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s most marginalized people—migrant workers, rural communities, and poor and working-class residents—have borne the brunt of abuses stemming from the fund’s projects. Capital from the PIF has been used for projects that have forcibly evicted residents, razed neighborhoods, subjected migrant workers to serious abuses, and silenced communities. Human Rights Watch also found violations linked to some of the PIF’s most high-profile megaprojects, including the NEOM region, an economic zone and new city on the Red Sea that is being erected from scratch, as well as the Jeddah Central Project, an urban development project in Jeddah. Saudi authorities forcibly evicted members of the Huwaitat tribe, who have for centuries inhabited the Tabuk province, in the planned NEOM area, arrested those who protested their evictions, and killed one protesting resident. Two residents received sentences of 50 years in prison, and three received death sentences for resisting the forced evictions. The wholly-PIF-owned Jeddah Central Development Company, which is carrying out the Jeddah Central Project, forcibly evicted large numbers of middle and lower-class Saudis, foreigners, and migrant workers from their homes in Jeddah’s previously vibrant working-class neighborhoods to transform the area into a luxury shopping and tourism district. Under internationally recognized human rights norms, the Saudi government should progressively realize economic, social, and cultural rights to the maximum of available resources, including those the PIF controls. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Saudi Arabia has the highest poverty headcount rate for nationals in the GCC at 13.6 percent, meaning that poverty affects nearly 'one in seven nationals in Saudi Arabia.' This figure does not include all Saudi residents, particularly migrant workers who make up approximately 42 percent of the population. The PIF under MBS operates with little transparency and accountability, raising concerns over whether these funds are ultimately invested and managed in a way that satisfies these international norms. The existence of a centrally controlled stream of revenue, such as oil revenue, can exacerbate an undemocratic ruler or governing elite’s abuses and misrule by providing the financial wherewithal to entrench and enrich itself without any corresponding accountability. These problems are clearly present in Saudi Arabia and raise significant risk that MBS is using the PIF to entrench his de facto rule by providing him with direct access and control to nearly a trillion dollars of Saudi Arabia’s wealth, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch did not find evidence that PIF-funded projects advanced the government’s obligations to fulfill economic, social, and cultural rights of its people. The Saudi government does not define or disclose basic data on poverty, or set a poverty line, making it likely that the poverty rate is much higher than the UN figure, especially affecting groups that are economically marginalized and vulnerable to systematic labor abuses. PIF investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in the world have been used as a tool of Saudi soft power and influence. These investments include sports such as the LIV golf tour, the FIFA 2034 World Cup, and Premier League football club Newcastle United, in the UK, are a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s influence operations abroad. These investments which seek to garner uncritical foreign support for MBS’s agenda, spread disinformation about the country’s rights record, neutralize scrutiny, silence critics, and undermine institutions seeking transparency and accountability, Human Rights Watch found. As a state entity, the PIF has an obligation to uphold Saudi Arabia’s international human rights commitments. Businesses have a responsibility to avoid causing or contributing to human rights harm. In line with these responsibilities, businesses should conduct thorough and independent human rights due diligence prior to any engagement with the PIF and should refrain from activities that would bolster the reputation of government entities or officials recently and credibly accused of serious abuses. When serious adverse human rights impacts stemming from engagement with the PIF are unavoidable, businesses should suspend their engagement with the PIF. 'Businesses with ties to the Saudi Public Investment Fund have a responsibility to end their engagement with it if serious human rights violations connected with the PIF are unavoidable,' Shea said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuTDFtH9RotFd	2024-11-22T16:31:12-08:00	
US House Of Representatives Approves Legislation Threatening Nonp...	On Thursday, the United States House of Representatives approved legislation that would threaten nonprofit organizations’ exercise of free speech rights. The legislation would accomplish this goal by empowering the US government to selectively clamp down on nonprofits to an extent that targeted organizations may cease to exist. This is all being done in the name of countering terrorism, a trusty standby excuse for the US government exercising authoritarian powers. The House approved the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act (HR 9495) by a vote of 219 to 184. The 'yes' votes came mainly from Republican members, and all the 'no' votes were from Democrats plus Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, an Advisory Board member for the Ron Paul Institute. J.D. Tuccille provided an informative critique of HR 9495 in a Friday Reason article. The bill, explained Tuccille, 'allows for the ‘termination of tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations.’' Continuing, Tuccille wrote: The designation of organizations as such is left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, based on that official’s judgment that a non-profit group has, in the last three years, provided ‘material support or resources’ to what the U.S. government considers a terrorist organization. The language provides for a 90-day window during which time supposed ‘terrorist supporting organizations’ can appeal the designation, but the burden is on them to prove that they’re not guilty. This turns due process on its head. The threat from this new bureaucratic power is extreme for targeted organizations. As Tuccille puts it in his article, the loss of 'tax -exempt status' is essentially a death penalty for most non-profit organizations.' What a censorship power this legislation hands over to the executive branch bureaucracy. Nonprofit organizations whose activities challenge the ambitions of the US government and connected individuals, businesses, and organizations, can be snuffed out. Meanwhile, other organizations will have a big incentive to limit their own speech to avoid being similarly targeted for destruction. During the House floor debate on HR 9495, Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) presented a brief, persuasive speech against the bill. Here is the text of his speech: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 9495. As Members of Congress, it is our duty to stand against terrorism and stand up for our common values, but this bill does neither.What does it do?What it does is grant sweeping draconian powers to the executive branch to essentially shut down any nonprofit.On what basis would future administrations, Democratic or Republican, be able to exercise such power?On a mere accusation.I repeat, an accusation.All nonprofits could be under scrutiny. These are decent people who are advocating on issues from religious freedom to animal welfare.Mr. Speaker, why would conservatives, the very same people who gnashed their teeth at executive overreach, support such a measure?Why would they suddenly about-face and sacrifice the values they claim to stand for?It is because this is a gift to the President-elect, Mr. Trump, wrapped up in a bow right before the holidays.On the campaign trail, he has made no secret of who he would seek to go after. This is bigger than the President-elect because now every President who would be king would be free to seek vengeance on their political opponents for every perceived slight.I caution my colleagues to consider how far-reaching the consequences of this bill would be. This bill would apply to all future Presidents.At a time when we should be strengthening our checks and balances and shoring up our guardrails, this legislation would do the opposite.Mr. Speaker, in the strongest possible terms, I urge my colleagues to vote against this executive branch power grab. This legislative threat to nonprofit organizations and their free speech can be expected to be rejected by the Democratic controlled Senate and President Joe Biden. But, it will likely be back for another go-round under more amenable conditions come January when the House, Senate, and presidency are all in Republican control.

Putin’s Order To Promote Patriotism Repeats Stalin’s ‘Almost Word...	Vladimir Putin’s May 2024 directive to use history lessons in the schools to boost patriotism and a willingness to sacrifice one’s life for Russia repeats Stalin’s May 1934 order to do the same thing in the Soviet Union 'almost word for word,' according to Boris Kerzhentsev. The historian and commentator traces the evolution of Kremlin policy toward history and its use as a propaganda tool in the first decades of Soviet power and then says that the changes Putin has introduced are virtually the same (moscowtimes.ru/2024/11/16/istoriya-v-zakone-kak-gosudarstvo-ispolzuet-proshloe-dlya-podgotovki-pushechnogo-myasa-a147872). 'Like Stalin, Putin’s ‘ideological front’ is rapidly turning into a real military front, on which people fooled by propaganda are dying senselessly. To be sure, foreign agents are not yet mentioned in the text of Putin’s ‘Foundations,’ but this is most likely a matter of time,' Kerzhentsev says. Indeed, he continues, 'some propagandists are already close to, as before, demanding from a high rostrum that ‘rootless cosmopolitans’ be shot ‘like mad dogs,’' as Stalin’s notorious prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky did. And thus one must conclude that despite everything, 'for almost a century, nothing has changed in Russia.' 'Using its unlimited resources of violence, control and coercion, the government constantly steals the country's truth about the past, composes its own alternative version of history, and declares it the only true one. And it does so not for the love of writing, but purely for the sake of ensuring the self-preservation of the regime,' Kerzhentsev concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuTwEB3BCQvc6	2024-11-22T16:26:43-08:00	
What Kennedy Must Do To Defeat Regulatory Capture – OpEd	President-Elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services is cause for celebration for anyone who cares about the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over regulatory agencies, and the deleterious effect it has had on the health of Americans. It is nearly impossible to express just how remarkable and potentially world-changing this is. Only a few years ago, it would have been beyond the imagination of any serious political commentator. Those of us who believe in the freedom of medical choice – and especially those who have been personally harmed by the industry – have every reason to be ecstatic. But even if Kennedy is confirmed, and even if he manages to implement his ideas, will they be enough to bring about real, lasting, change? One of Kennedy’s primary targets will be the regulatory capture that practically defines the pharmaceutical industry and the agencies tasked with overseeing it. He has spent decades tirelessly battling this particular beast, and has recently articulated a number of specific policy ideas aimed at rooting out the 'corruption' that characterizes the regulatory agencies as well as the world of medical research. But is that even possible? In order to answer this question, we need to examine the nature of the regulatory state itself. The Regulatory State There is nothing new about private commercial interests seeking to use government force to subvert the free market to their advantage – and to the disadvantage of everyone else. The medical and pharmaceutical industries are hardly unique in this regard. Generally, interest groups, or individual corporations, do this by convincing politicians to erect barriers – in the form of laws and regulations – to those who would compete with them. Much has been written about the extent to which the regulation of business sprang, not from a desire to protect consumers, but rather from the desire on the part of a few businesses to secure for themselves an environment in which they are insulated from competition. In their 1993 paper, 'The Protectionist Roots of Antitrust,' for example, Don Boudreaux and Tom DiLorenzo look at some specific examples of business interests lobbying government to enact antitrust legislation that would stifle their competition. They write: '(F)or over a century the antitrust laws have routinely been used to thwart competition by providing a vehicle for uncompetitive businesses to sue their competitors for cutting prices, innovating new products and processes, and expanding output. This paper has argued that, moreover, antitrust was a protectionist institution from the very beginning; there never was a ‘golden age of antitrust’ besieged by rampant cartelization, as the standard account of the origins of antitrust attests.' The world of health care as we know it today in America is the result of similar efforts by some practitioners and professional associations to defeat their competitors, not by outperforming them in the marketplace, but by enacting laws to limit their ability to practice. Most notorious among these efforts was the 1910 Flexner Report. Commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation, the Report recommended closing down the vast majority of medical schools; streamlining medical education to exclude non-allopathic modalities (and mostly eliminating medical schools for women and African Americans); giving state governments the power to approve medical schools; and dramatically tightening medical licensing restrictions. In fact, the Flexner Report was, for the most part, an unpublished 1906 reportwritten by the American Medical Association (AMA). At the time, the AMA made no secret about its motives in seeking the reforms to which Abraham Flexner lent his name. It sought to reduce the supply of physicians in order to further enrich its own members. In 1847, the Association’s committee on educational standards reported that: 'The very large number of physicians in the United States…has frequently been the subject of remark. To relieve the diseases of something more than twenty millions of people, we have an army of Doctors amounting by a recent computation to forty thousand, which allows one to about every five hundred inhabitants…No wonder, then, that the profession of medicine has measurably ceased to occupy the elevated position which once it did; no wonder that the merest pittance in the way of remuneration is scantily doled out even to the most industrious in our ranks…' The very history of the regulatory state informs us that it was not implemented for the purpose of protecting consumers from powerful corporate interests, but to protect the interests of certain powerful corporations and groups of professionals. It is important to remember this when we hear critics bemoan the 'corruption' in the regulatory agencies, and insist that this can be remedied if we just put the right people in charge of them. No. 'Corruption' is the primordial swamp from which these agencies emerged. It is in their DNA. It is, in fact, their very reason for being. There is no 'reforming' that which is operating precisely as it was designed to operate. Moreover, even if these agencies had been designed with the interests of the public in mind (and never mind that 'the public' is not a single entity with uniform interests to begin with), the reality remains that there is no mechanism by which they can be made accountable to us. Accountability between two parties can only come when each party has choice regarding whether or not they interact with the other. This is not the case with regulatory agencies. These are imposed upon us. We are forced to use their 'services' whether we are happy with them or not; whether they do a good job or not; whether they make our lives more dangerous than they otherwise would be or not. No matter how badly regulatory agencies perform, we are not free to take our business elsewhere. The FDA What this means is that – just as with all other political actors – the leaders of these agencies are removed from the consequences that their actions have on others. In the case of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this has led to decades of malfeasance and error that have cost many, many, lives. Perhaps the most infamous example in recent times is the FDA’s complete failure to protect the public from the painkiller Vioxx. The agency approved the drug in 1999, following which it is believed to have killed as many as 55,000 Americans before being withdrawn in 2004. Significantly, the FDA did not withdraw Vioxx from the market, Merck did that itself. In fact, it appears that the regulatory agency worked to suppress information about the known risks of the drug: 'A Merck memo uncovered in November showed that Merck scientists were aware in 1996 that the drug might contribute to heart problems. Then in 2000, a Merck study found that patients taking Vioxx were twice as likely to suffer heart attacks as patients taking older painkillers. Meanwhile, mid-level FDA officials who warned of these dangers were shunned by the agency. In FDA parlance, those with a 'point of view' on Vioxx were unwelcome in certain meetings concerning the drug.'' To believe that the Vioxx scandal was an isolated event would be a mistake. Indeed, the history of the agency is littered with similar stories. Worse, it also uses its power to prevent people from having access to treatments that may help them, but that would not be very profitable, or which might otherwise go against the interests of the agency’s industry benefactors. We witnessed this in the extreme during the past few years, when the FDA and the rest of the regulatory establishment waged a war on Covid-19 treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, and even Vitamins C and D. The FDA does not fail to protect the public because it happens to have bad people in its leadership, or because they are 'incompetent.' It fails to protect us because it has no incentive to do so. We are captive 'customers.' We cannot take our money elsewhere. The leadership at the FDA has no tangible reason to care about our interests. And there is no amount of 'draining the swamp' that can change this. What Can Be Done? The only hope, within this kind of system, is to defy the odds – and not insignificantly, to defy the vast sums of industry lobbying money – and get someone into a position of power over the regulatory agencies who has the will to force them to act contrary to their own incentives within the system. That person right now is undoubtedly Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and, should he be confirmed as Secretary of HHS, he will undoubtedly do some good things. But what happens after he is gone? The system itself will not have been changed. The incentives that are in place now will still be in place then. What happens when there is no longer a good person, with good intentions, in a position of some power over these agencies? Should our right to informed consent, for example, rely on our being fortunate enough to have 'good people' in charge of fundamentally unaccountable agencies? Agencies that have the power to withhold potentially life-saving products from the marketplace, while at the same time providing a false sense of security about the dangerous ones they allow? One of the proposals Kennedy has put forward is to reform the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. He writes: 'Pharmaceutical companies pay a fee every time they apply for a new drug approval, and this money makes up about 75% of the budget of the Food and Drug Administration’s drug division. That creates a barrier to entry to smaller firms and puts bureaucrats’ purse strings in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry.' Reforming, or better yet, eliminating, this fee would be a step in the right direction. But it would not change the fundamental nature of the FDA. It would not magically make that agency accountable to the public, nor would it remove the ability of those in the pharmaceutical industry to make other forms of payments to the agency. Even now, the industry has other ways of exerting its influence, including the infamous 'revolving door,' whereby agency officials who do well by a particular drug company while working for the FDA are later rewarded with lucrative positions in that company. And according to an investigative report by Science, post-approval payments in varying forms are also common. Science examined payment records between 2013-2016, and found that: 'Of the more than $24 million in personal payments or research support from industry to the 16 top-earning advisers—who received more than $300,000 each—93% came from the makers of drugs those advisers previously reviewed or from competitors.' Critics of this kind of industry capture have long called for 'getting money out' of the regulatory structure. But it remains unclear how this might be achieved. Certainly, specific payment channels, such as the Prescription Drug User Fees, can be eliminated or banned. But to imagine that those in the industry would not contrive of other ways to buy influence is not realistic. Just as critically though, even if pharmaceutical companies were somehow prevented from being able to pay off the agencies that regulate them, this would still not render those agencies accountable to the public, or to anyone other than themselves. The only way to 'get money out' of the regulatory state is to stop giving that state favors to sell. It is to eliminate the state’s power to restrict market entry and market participation. These are the political favors that powerful industry interests bid for. If we want to stop that from happening, we need to eliminate those favors. But We Need the Regulatory State to Keep Us Safe! Astonishingly, even after the past four years, there are still a great many people who believe that the regulatory state exists to keep us safe. That it withheld potentially life-saving therapeutics from us, not out of malice or the interests of its corporate cronies, but for our protection. That it worked hard to censor information about these therapeutics, and about the dangers of the experimental product it was promoting, for the same reason. That maybe some mistakes were made during this time, but that really, truly, these agencies are designed to protect us and if we just get the right people in charge, and maybe do a little tinkering with the machinery, they will work as they are supposed to. Again, no. They are working precisely as they are supposed to. But for those who remain unconvinced, for anyone who still believes that existing laws against fraud, malpractice, and other torts are not enough, that we need some sort of government oversight over the medical industry, let’s look a little closer. Economist Milton Friedman famously recommended abolishing both medical licensing and the FDA. He wrote: 'The FDA has done enormous harm to the health of the American public by greatly increasing the costs of pharmaceutical research, thereby reducing the supply of new and effective drugs, and by delaying the approval of such drugs as survive the tortuous FDA process.' Others who have examined the agency’s track record concur that the agency does more harm than good. Nobel laureate George Hitchings, for instance, estimated that the FDA’s five-year delay in introducing the antibiotic Septra to the market resulted in 80,000 deaths in the US. Drug regulation expert Dale Gieringer says that the death toll resulting from the FDA forcibly keeping new medications from the market far outweighs any benefits it may have produced. He writes: 'The benefits of FDA regulation relative to that in foreign countries could reasonably be put at some 5,000 casualties per decade or 10,000 per decade for worst-case scenarios. In comparison…the cost of FDA delay can be estimated at anywhere from 21,000 to 120,000 lives per decade.' Economist Daniel Klein notes that, prior to the FDA’s powers being expanded in 1962, existing tort law did a good job of protecting consumers: 'The FDA was much less powerful before 1962. The historical record—decades of a relatively free market up to 1962—shows that free-market institutions and the tort system succeeded in keeping unsafe drugs to a minimum. The Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy (107 killed) was the worst in those decades. (Thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States.) The economists Sam Peltzman and Dale Gieringer have made the grisly comparison: the victims of Sulfanilamide and other small tragedies prior to 1962 are insignificant compared to the death toll of the post-1962 FDA.' He goes on to compare medical regulation to safety regulation in other industries: 'How is safety assured in other industries? In electronics, manufacturers submit products to Underwriters’ Laboratories, a private organization that grants its safety mark to products that pass its inspection. The process is voluntary: manufacturers may sell without the UL mark. But retailers and distributors usually prefer the products with it. 'Suppose someone proposed a new government agency that forbade manufacturers from making any electronic product until approved by the agency. We would think the proposal to be totalitarian and crazy. But that is the system we have in drugs…' Conclusion As long as regulatory powers exist that allow state entities to restrict entry into markets, and to dictate how producers may participate in those markets, there will always be those who are incentivized to gain access to the levers of that power and use it to further their own ends. Those who have the means to pay for this power will always find ways to do so. What many call 'corruption' is rather the predictable and inevitable outcome of institutions that are, by their very nature, unaccountable to those they purport to serve. The solution is not to get 'better people' in charge of these institutions, nor is it to engage in a never-ending battle to stop participants from following the incentives the system has created for them. The solution is to remove those incentives. The solution is to remove the powers of the regulatory state itself. If Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is confirmed as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, he will undoubtedly strike some blows against regulatory capture. Whatever he does in this position can only be an improvement over what we have now, and it is possible that some of his reforms may even endure beyond his own tenure. But he has the chance to do much more. The regulatory state is a Gordian knot, and it is not enough to work at untangling its various components. It needs to be sliced through once and for all. The way to do this is simple: Abolish the FDA, abolish the NIH, abolish the CDC. End all medical licensing and accreditation. Get the government out of health care everywhere. Perhaps this sounds like a political impossibility. And perhaps it is. But until very recently, RFK, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services was a political impossibility. I submit that we do not know what is possible and what is not. Kennedy has an unprecedented opportunity to strike at the root of what makes our healthcare system so dysfunctional: to dismantle the institutions that stifle the production of medicine, distort information about its safety, and suppress alternatives. He has an opportunity to make a profound difference not only for the next four years but for generations to come. We should all hope that he does not waste it.

The Operational And Strategic Genius Of The Kursk Offensive – Ana...	By Dan Cox (FPRI) -- Current analysis of the recent offensive conducted by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of Russia is incomplete at best and misguided at worst. Most of the pundits are focused on speculating whether the recent offensive will anger American politicians, lead to an eventual victory, or halt the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Dealing with the anger of American politicians first, it is unlikely that Ukraine conducted this counteroffensive in a vacuum. American politicians were likely aware of the operation. Dealing with the next question, speculating on whether one operation will 'tip the scales' fits into the American culture of viewing events, wars, and almost everything as a black-and-white or win-lose dichotomy. Finally, the attack on Russia was not intended to halt the main Russian offensive in Pokrovsk. At most, this attack was aimed at drawing troops from the Russian attack on Kharkiv, which, being one of the largest population centers in Ukraine, would represent a major loss for Ukraine, should it fall into Russian hands. Instead of entering this American cultural quagmire, this essay examines the situation by looking at the Kursk campaign holistically and through the intersection of military operations and strategy. This intersection is often referred to as the area where operational art occurs. By examining the Kursk offensive holistically, this approach does not fall into the rut of determining winners and losers. Instead, myriad potential opportunities and pitfalls can be examined simultaneously. The evidence shows a great deal of cleverness and foresight in developing the Kursk battle plan. The West should support this new propensity in the system as it puts Vladimir Putin and his military planning staff on the horns of multiple dilemmas. A Brief Analysis of the Kursk Campaign So Far One of the best analyses of the Kursk campaign comes from Foreign Policy Magazine. However, the debate is emblematic of the narrowness and black-and-white construct of argumentation over the Ukrainian military campaign. This debate between two Foreign Policy Magazine columnists produces some curious insights into the Kursk offensive. Emma Ashford took the con side of the debate, arguing that it was unlikely that Ukrainian forces could hold what they had taken. She painted the operation as producing, at best, a short-term narrative shift in Zelensky’s favor. She concluded that the offensive is not likely to produce lasting positive results; although, she admits later in the debate that Putin has at least temporarily lost the claim of freezing the conflict and easily controlling what they have already taken in Ukraine. Matt Kroenig countered by noting that the offensive accomplished several key strategic aims, such as taking the war home to Russia (hundreds of thousands of Russians had to be evacuated), challenging Putin as a wartime leader, buoying Ukrainian morale, and shocking the West. The narrative of 'shocking the West' is common in analyzing the Kursk offensive and is dubious. It is doubtful that NATO military planners had no idea of this offensive. Whether or not Ukraine directly informed the US and other Western policymakers, the level of coordination between Ukrainian and Western military planners makes it likely that Ukraine’s partners were able to infer an impending operation. This assertion may prove untrue in the future, but that would only point to deeper strategic problems between the West and Ukraine. It is not the case that any of the assertions are necessarily wrong. The main complaint is that they are incomplete and largely reside in narrow strategic and political arguments and assertions. Other standard refrains in the analysis so far are that this operation was a gamble for Ukraine and the offensive was ineffective at stopping the Russians’ forward progression in eastern Ukraine. Few military operations are a true gamble despite current assertions to the contrary. Military planning revolves around assumptions and risk. The main risk in this mission is that the assumptions are wrong. I would posit that the most likely assumptions that preceded this operation have, so far, proven to be correct. Likely Assumptions and Risks in the Kursk Campaign The first set of assumptions had to be that Putin’s military had no strategic reserve and was so desperately trying to win in Ukraine that Russia had devoted little or no attention to defending the Russo–Ukrainian border from the Russian-controlled Donbas Region to the border of Belarus. The ease with which fifteen thousand soldiers were able to take land in Kursk supports such assumptions on the ground. A little over a few divisions’ worth of Ukrainian forces expanded past the initial incursion of a few hundred square kilometers to more than double that area in just a few weeks. The Ukrainian planners also likely assumed that they could make it far enough into Russian territory to threaten logistical lines and necessary electrical and gas hubs supplying troops in Ukraine. Since Ukrainian forces have been able to destroy several critical Russian bridges that resupply its troops and an oil depot, this assumption has borne fruit as well. The planners must have also assumed it was better to use fifteen thousand troops to advance into Russia and build defensive positions than to hold positions that would likely be overrun. Therefore, fifteen thousand Ukrainians could potentially hold out against a force five times that size or larger in Russia depending on whether the force sent to dislodge is ill-trained and ill-equipped conscripts. Putin ordered thirty thousand soldiers from eastern Ukraine to march to the Kursk region to defend it, and he has also apparently thrown some eight thousand against the Ukrainian incursion. This represents a significant expansion of war and a de facto admission of Russia’s limited ability to generate labor. Eventually, the Russian offensive in Donetsk might be put at risk because of the Kursk campaign, even though this was not the main point of invading Russia. Finally, the Ukrainian military and political leaders assessed that an invasion of Kursk would change the narrative in their favor. Further, this would place Putin at a strategic disadvantage and expose fundamental weaknesses in Russia continuing the war. The discussion below points to these assumptions also being true. Placing Putin on the Horns of Multiple Dilemmas The Kursk offensive exposed many deficiencies and vulnerabilities in the Russian offensive as the war approached the third-year mark. Unfortunately, some pundits and news outlets prefer to view the Kursk offensive as a gamble or even a failure. France 24 recently reported that Russia is making gains in eastern Ukraine despite the Kursk action. The news outlet also reported that Ukrainian planners had hoped to draw Russian troops away from this offensive, but it did not happen. This is factually incorrect and an overly narrow view of the Kursk offensive. It is factually incorrect to assert there was no effect on the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russia redeployed thirty thousand troops to stop the advancement of the Ukrainian forces into Russia. Whether this puts the Russian offensive at risk remains to be seen, but it does not matter as much as some think. The move illustrates to the world that Putin has no strategic reserve to put into the fight and is likely desperate. Further, arguing that delaying the Russian offensive was the only operational objective is short-sighted. The fact that Russia is pressing on with its offensive may counterintuitively be good for the Ukrainian war effort. Russia continues to take unsustainable losses, and the Kursk offensive has accelerated that trend. They have already taken an additional 6,600 casualties and lost 70 tanks because the Ukrainian military infiltrated Russia. Putin panicked and made yet another strategic mistake by telling his own people that the Ukrainian forces would be dislodged from Kursk by October 1 of this year. By early November, Putin had finally garnered a force to attack the Kursk oblast. However, the ground retaken is negligible and the losses the Russians are suffering are great. Putin is desperate. Every day beyond October 1 that the Ukrainian forces remain in Russia, Putin is losing political credibility. Further, this is the second summer in a row that Putin has faced a major credibility challenge. Last summer, the leader of the Wagner Group private military organization, Yevgeny Prigozhin, mounted an insurgency that briefly marched toward Moscow. This summer, Ukrainian forces successfully invaded Russia in the historic Kursk region. To add insult to injury, the Ukrainian success in Russia came mere months after Putin gave a speech commemorating the Russian sacrifices during World War II in Kursk. The Kursk offensive has also increased the Ukrainian military’s operational reach. The Ukrainian forces have already destroyed some key supply bridges supporting Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have also been able to destroy fuel depots, particularly oil, deeper into Russia, threatening both the Russian economy and the ability of Russia to continue to supply its mechanized units. Ukraine has also been able to hit an oil refinery and a power station deeper into Russia. The loss of the refinery could seriously damage oil exports, which are already lagging due to economic sanctions imposed by the West. Putin is also suffering from a foreign policy and narrative perspective. Several pundits have noted that Putin seems to be losing allied support as Ukraine demonstrates its ability to compete with Russia in Ukraine and, shockingly, take Russian territory. Putin cannot carpet-bomb Ukrainian positions now that they are on Russian soil. Further, even though Putin diverted thirty thousand troops in an attempt to repel the Kursk incursion, their move will likely be insufficient for the task. The recent addition of some ten to twelve thousand North Korean troops to the Russian counter-offensive may tilt the odds a bit in Russia’s favor, but also telegraphs Russia’s lack of a strategic reserve and was the catalyst for Western countries to allow Ukraine to use their weapons to strike inside Russia. Now, Putin is facing a dilemma that he may have to throw poorly trained conscripts at the situation. He promised he would not do this; many of these conscripts are ethnically Russian, so their deaths carry more negative political weight for Putin, who cannot afford a collapse in support for his war among ethnic Russians. All of these negative strategic dilemmas are now on Putin’s shoulders. Further, he now has to consider that a long border between the Donbas region, which Russia controls, and Belarus is now at risk. He can hardly respond to the Kursk incursion. Another incursion at a different point along the border would be devastating. Pundits reporting that the Kursk offensive has failed because Putin continues a costly advance at a snail’s pace in eastern Ukraine are short-sighted. Recent polls show that trust in Putin has fallen precipitously in the wake of the Kursk offensive. Putin might find himself in political trouble because the planners of the Ukrainian offensive successfully linked operations to strategic ends, placing Putin on the horns of multiple dilemmas.

Putin Warns Of More Combat Tests For New Missile After Ukraine St...	(RFE/RL) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, a nuclear-capable weapon, will continue to be tested, including in combat conditions, as Moscow struck several Ukrainian regions with other, less powerful weapons. 'We will continue these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and the nature of the security threats that are created for Russia,' Putin said on November 22 at a meeting with Defense Ministry officials and military-industrial complex officials. The Kremlin leader also called for serial production of the large missile to begin. Russia launched the so-called Oreshnik ballistic missile against Ukraine on November 21 in a strike targeting the city of Dnipro. Putin said at the time it was part of Moscow's response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil with U.S.-supplied ATACMS and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. The use of the Oreshnik 'is first and foremost a messaging and saber rattling kind of weapon. This is the sort of delivery system that's not cheap. It's not a battlefield sort of weapon,' Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told RFE/RL. Putin added on November 22 that the Oreshnik is new and not an upgrade of previous Soviet-designed weaponry. The United States said the new missile is 'experimental' and based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Ukraine initially accused Russia of having used an ICBM in the Dnipro attack. An ICBM has never been used in a war. Strategic Weapons Russia has been striking Ukraine with Iskanders, ground-launched, short-range ballistic missiles, and Kinzhals, air-launched, intermediate-range ballistic missiles, as well as various cruise missiles. Russia probably only has several units of the Oreshnik in stock, a U.S. official told media following the November 21 strike. Ukraine's military intelligence put the figure at up to 10 units.If Russia were to move forward with serial production of the Oreshnik, it would be for its nuclear force posture and not for use in a conventional war like the one with Ukraine, Karako said. 'This is not an alternative to a cruise missile. It's probably designed for strategic weapons,' he said. Zelenskiy's Response In his November 21 address to the nation announcing the use of the Oreshnik, Putin said that the missile traveled at a speed of Mach 10, or 2.5-3 kilometers per second, claiming that 'there are currently no ways of counteracting this weapon.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on November 22 that Ukraine was working on developing new types of air defenses to counter 'new risks,' a reference to missiles like the Oreshnik. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said testing a new weapon for the purposes of terror in another country was an 'international crime' and called for a worldwide 'serious response' to keep Russia from expanding the war. 'When someone starts using other countries not only for terror, but also for testing their new missiles through acts of terror, then this is clearly an international crime.' A lack of air defenses has been one of Ukraine's major weak spots in the 33-month war with Ukraine. Zelenskiy has called on the West to deliver more air defense systems since the first days of the invasion. He had also called on the West to ease restrictions preventing Ukraine from striking inside Russia with powerful long-range weapons. Zelenskiy said the deep strikes were necessary to target airfields critical for Russia's daily aerial attacks. The United States and the United Kingdom reportedly lifted the restrictions on November 17 with Ukraine using their long-range weapons -- ATACMS and Storm Shadow respectively -- to hit targets in Russia's regions of Belgorod and Kursk. Putin launched the Oreshnik into Ukraine to warn the West against arming Ukraine. Parliament Session Canceled Russia did not use the Oreshnik to strike Ukraine during another deadly air attack on November 22. Two people were killed and 12 wounded in Russian strikes on Sumy, Artem Kobzar, the mayor of the northeastern Ukrainian city, reported in a video statement on Telegram. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russian drone attacks were under way in four regions -- Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Zhytomyr. In the capital, which has been on edge for several days amid intense Russian attacks on Ukraine, lawmakers were advised to avoid the government district on November 22 and parliament canceled a scheduled session due to warnings of a potential missile strike. 'We were informed about the risk of a missile strike on the Verkhovna Rada in Kyiv in the coming days. Putin has significantly raised the stakes. Tomorrow's parliamentary session is canceled,' lawmaker Taras Batenko said. Oleksiy Honcharenko, another lawmaker, said on Telegram that the next session was now planned for December, although parliament leaders have not officially commented on the warnings. Zelenskiy's office assured the public that the presidential administration would continue operating 'as usual' on November 22.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuU3v2dZmQm4T	2024-11-22T15:42:37-08:00	
Myanmar: Rebels Capture Town On Main Road To Chinese-Built Port	Insurgents in western Myanmar have captured a town on a road junction leading to a Chinese-funded deep sea port, which is bound to raise new concern about the fate of an extensive development that includes energy pipelines running from the coast to southern China. The Myanmar junta that seized power in a 2021 coup has in recent weeks been reinforcing its defenses at the Kyaukpyu economic zone on the coast of Rakhine state, where China is building a port and energy facilities, including its cross-country natural gas and oil pipelines. Insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA), which is fighting for self-determination in Rakhine state, have made significant advances against the military over the past year, leaving junta forces confined to ever smaller pockets of territory, including Kyaukpyu. On Wednesday, AA fighters captured the town of Toungup, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southwest of Kyaukpyu on the main road links to central and southern parts of the country, after nearly a month of fighting. 'The AA has captured Toungup town and surrounding battalion bases,' a resident of the town, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals, told Radio Free Asia. 'In the city, the soldiers deserted and the AA is evacuating residents,' said the resident. Junta forces were attacking Toungup with aircraft and artillery and some houses were ablaze, residents said. Residents had no information about casualties. RFA tried to contact both the junta’s spokesperson in Rakhine state, Hla Thein, and the AA spokesperson, Khaing Thukha, to ask about the situation but neither responded by the time of publication. The AA has dealt the military some of the most devastating setbacks since the 2021 coup, seizing over half of state’s townships, naval and military bases and stretches of coast, including foreign development projects. The AA had been fighting for control over Toungup township since Nov. 4. The town was home to the military’s last operational command headquarters in Rakhine state, as well as the headquarters of several battalions, including an engineers battalion. The capture of the town represents the removal of a major obstacle for the AA if it decides to try to capture Kyaukpyu, a hub in China’s Belt and Road network of energy and infrastructure projects. The military has recently been sending reinforcements to Kyaukpyu, insurgent sources and residents said. The AA is also attacking the military in its last important bases in Rakhine state’s Ann and Gwa towns. Of Rakhine state’s 17 townships, the AA has captured 10, in addition to one in neighboring Chin state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuaIpL6WnoxJF	2024-11-22T15:41:04-08:00	
US Weapons Delays Costly For Ukraine Yet Again – Analysis	By Luke Coffey US President Joe Biden last week finally allowed Ukraine to use American-made long-range missiles against targets inside the Russian Federation. In addition, the administration disclosed that, for the first time, the US would provide Kyiv with antipersonnel landmines — something Biden had been reluctant to do because of pressure from within his own party. Make no mistake: both these measures will have a positive impact on the battlefield, especially in the area surrounding Kursk Oblast. But the White House’s delay is concerning. For more than 100 days, Ukrainian soldiers have controlled a piece of Russian territory in this region. Ukraine’s decision to launch operations in Kursk back in August made perfect sense. By holding Russian territory, Ukrainian forces have forced Moscow to divert resources from other sections of the front line to Kursk and created bargaining power for any future negotiations. Furthermore, Ukraine’s success in this operation reminded the world that success is possible when the right weapons and support are provided. The capture of Russian territory also gave a much-needed morale boost to Ukrainians, who have endured slow but steady Russian advances along other parts of the front line. Yet, from the moment Ukraine launched its operation in Kursk, it had been asking for permission to use American-made missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Ukrainian officials knew that Russian forces were preparing a major counterattack. This threat became even more pressing with the arrival of more than 10,000 North Korean troops deployed to help Russia retake the territory Ukraine had captured. Throughout Russia’s buildup in the region, Ukraine was able to pinpoint where troops were staging and where supply points were located. Frustratingly, these targets were out of range for Ukraine’s existing weapons. Until this week, the US was unwilling to approve the use of its systems, fearing such actions might be viewed as escalatory by Moscow. This week’s decision to allow these weapons’ use, along with Washington’s agreement to supply antipersonnel mines to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, highlights a recurring theme: the US delivering aid to Ukraine too little, too late. This pattern has plagued America’s support for Ukraine since the early days of the war in 2022. To give credit where it is due, Biden rushed crucial aid to Ukraine in the early weeks of the conflict, enabling the successful defense of Kyiv and later counteroffensives. But for much of the war, Ukraine’s requests for critical weapons systems have gone unanswered — or have remained unfulfilled until the need became urgent. For example, from the start of the conflict, Ukraine requested the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, which proved to be highly effective. However, it was not until after Mariupol fell to Russian forces in May 2022 that the first HIMARS arrived. That summer, Ukraine repeatedly sought Patriot air defense systems to protect its skies. The US did not approve their transfer until Russia escalated airstrikes in October and November of that year. Even then, it took months to train Ukrainian forces to operate them, leaving the country vulnerable throughout the winter. Other delays affected the provision of cluster munitions, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and the long-range ATACMS missiles. While the US eventually authorized all these systems, its indecision cost Ukraine dearly, forcing it to respond reactively instead of proactively. So, how does Biden’s recent announcement affect Ukraine’s prospects in the war? Had these weapons been approved sooner, they could have disrupted some of Russia’s progress along the front lines. Now, their impact will likely be limited to the ongoing fighting around Kursk Oblast. Some critics argue that the timing is irresponsible, considering Biden is now a lame-duck president who will hand over power to Donald Trump in January. On the contrary, Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian targets actually strengthens Trump’s position in potential peace talks. These weapons give Trump an additional bargaining chip to pressure Moscow — a tool he would not otherwise have had. The White House’s delays in providing key military equipment is one reason why many Ukrainians are open to the idea of a Trump presidency. Few deny that Trump sincerely wants to end the war, though many are unsure how he intends to accomplish this. Ukrainians have grown increasingly frustrated with the current administration’s approach: providing just enough support to give the appearance of action, but not enough to ensure success. The delay in allowing Ukrainians to strike inside Russia is only the latest example of this hesitancy. This frustration has led some Ukrainians to consider gambling on Trump. Speculation even suggests that Trump, during his recent meeting with Biden, influenced the timing of this policy shift. While unconfirmed, it seems unlikely that the two leaders met without discussing Ukraine, one of the most pressing foreign policy challenges facing the US. If Trump is serious about bringing all sides to the negotiating table, his top priority should be getting Ukraine into a position of strength. Allowing Ukraine to target Russian command and control centers while disrupting supply chains is a critical first step. These actions could tilt the balance of power, paving the way for meaningful negotiations. The US’ reluctance to act decisively has undoubtedly prolonged the war and increased its costs. While the latest decision comes late, it still holds the potential to shape the outcome of the current battle in Kursk in a positive way. The lesson from this war is clear: timely aid can mean the difference between stalemate and success. The latest announcement, though overdue, underscores the importance of providing Ukraine with the tools it needs in a timely manner and not months after the fact. As the US undertakes a transfer of power, the coming months will be crucial for Ukraine. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Brazil: Bolsonaro Indicted By Federal Police For Coup Attempt	By Alex Rodrigues Brazil’s Federal Police have concluded their investigation into a criminal organization allegedly working to prevent President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin from assuming office in 2022, following the defeat of then-President Jair Bolsonaro in the presidential elections. In a statement released on Thursday (Nov. 21), the Federal Police confirmed that the final investigation report had been sent to the Supreme Court. Among the 37 individuals indicted for crimes including violent abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law, coup d'état, and criminal organization are former President Jair Bolsonaro; ex-Navy commander Almir Garnier Santos; federal representative Alexandre Ramagem (Liberal Party) and former director of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin); former Justice Minister Anderson Torres; ex-Institutional Security Cabinet Minister Augusto Heleno; Army Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former aide; Liberal Party president Valdemar Costa Neto; and former President’s Chief of Staff and Defense Minister Walter Souza Braga Netto. According to the Federal Police, the evidence against the individuals indicted was gathered over nearly two years through a range of investigative measures. These included telematics, telephone, banking, and tax record analysis, plea bargains, search and seizure operations, and other actions authorized by the Judiciary. The investigations revealed that the individuals involved were organized into distinct groups, each with specific responsibilities, including the Disinformation and Electoral System Attack Cell; the Military Incitement Cell; the Legal Cell; the Operational Cell Supporting Coup Activities; the Parallel Intelligence Cell; and the Operational Cell for Executing Coercive Measures. 'With the submission of the report [to the Supreme Court], the Federal Police are concluding their investigation into the attempted coup d'état and the violent overthrow of Democratic Rule of Law,' stated the police.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuudBdUR0M3bl9	2024-11-22T15:36:27-08:00	
Russia: Pentecostal Pastor, Buddhist In Pre-Trial Detention For A...	By Victoria Arnold A Pentecostal pastor has become the first person to be accused of publicly calling for actions 'against state security' for speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine from a religious perspective. Nikolay Romanyuk, senior presbyter of Holy Trinity Church in the Moscow Region town of Balashikha, gave a sermon in September 2022 in which he explicitly stated that believers should not go to fight in Ukraine 'on the basis of Holy Scripture'. If convicted, Pastor Romanyuk could face up to 6 years' imprisonment or a fine of up to 1 million Roubles (7 months' average Moscow wage) (see below). Investigators arrested Pastor Romanyuk after early-morning armed raids on his home and those of several other church members on 18 October 2024. Two days later, a court ruled that he should be detained for two months. He is currently being held in Investigation Prison No. 11 in Noginsk, 50 kms (30 miles) east of Moscow (see below). Because the sermon was livestreamed and then uploaded to the church's YouTube channel, Pastor Romanyuk is under investigation under Criminal Code Article 280.4, Part 2, Paragraph V – 'Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet' (see below). It remains unclear which investigative agencies carried out the raids on church members' home and initiated the criminal case against Pastor Romanyuk. Forum 18 sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the Federal Security Service (FSB). Forum 18 asked in what way Romanyuk's sermon threatened state security, why he had been placed in detention, whether any criminal or administrative cases had been opened against any other church members, and why it had been deemed necessary to carry out armed raids on their homes. Forum 18 has received no response (see below). While Pastor Romanyuk is the first religious figure to be charged under Criminal Code Article 280.4, small numbers of Russians who oppose the war on religious grounds continue to face prosecution under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'), Criminal Code Article 280.3 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, [and] maintain international peace and security'), and Criminal Code Article 207.3 (dissemination of 'false information' about the Armed Forces). Ilya Vasilyev, founder and director of the Moscow Zen Centre, is due to go on trial soon on charges of spreading 'knowingly false information' about the Russian Armed Forces 'on grounds of hatred or enmity' (Criminal Code Article 207.3, Part 2, Paragraph D). He is being prosecuted for an English-language Facebook post about Russian rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities. He made the post – and others for which he was previously prosecuted under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 – 'solely out of religious conviction', his lawyer told Forum 18. If convicted, Vasilyev could be imprisoned for 5 to 10 years or be fined 3 million to 5 million Roubles (see below). Vasilyev has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina Investigation Prison (see below). At a court hearing on 19 November 2024, where the judge extended Vasilyev's period in custody by six months, Vasilyev noted the difficulties of carrying out Buddhist rituals in the detention centre, but said in a message to supporters that he continues to meditate twice a week (see below). On 12 November, a court in Moscow fined Russian Orthodox Christian Aleksey Sevastyanenko 5 days' average Moscow wage under Article 20.3.3 for accusing President Vladimir Putin and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill of murdering civilians in Ukraine. During his conversation with his church's pro-war priest, Sevastyanenko stated: 'Thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house' (see below). Forum 18 asked the Moscow Interior Ministry in what way Sevastyanenko's statements had 'discredited' the Russian Armed Forces. Forum 18 received no response (see below). Charges and punishments President Vladimir Putin signed Criminal Code Article 280.4 into law on 14 July 2022. This was one of several new criminal offences designed to discourage and punish criticism of the authorities in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Part 1 punishes 'Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation' with the following possible penalties:– a fine of 100,000 to 500,000 Roubles;– 2 to 4 years' imprisonment, with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to three years. Part 2 covers the same offence when committed 'a) by a group of persons by prior conspiracy; b) by a person using their official position; v) using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet; g) for selfish motives or for hire; or d) motivated by political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or motivated by hatred or enmity towards any social group', and carries the following punishments: – a fine of 300,000 to 1 million Roubles; – 3 to 6 years' imprisonment with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to 5 years and with or without restriction of freedom for a period of 6 months to 2 years; On 4 March 2022, specific Criminal Code and Administrative Code penalties for 'discrediting' the Russian Armed Forces came into force, alongside criminal penalties for spreading 'false information' about the Armed Forces' actions (Criminal Code Article 207.3). Some of the punishments were increased on 28 March 2023. Although the government introduced Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 and the associated Criminal Code Article 280.3 on 4 March 2022 in order to punish 'discreditation' of the Armed Forces, amendments to the law on 25 March 2022 expanded the definition of this offence to include 'discreditation' of 'the execution by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers for the specified purposes', ie. protecting Russian interests and 'maintaining international peace and security'. The government has used a range of tactics to pressure religious leaders into supporting the renewed invasion of Ukraine. These tactics include warnings to senior and local religious leaders, and prosecuting and fining religious believers and clergy who have publicly opposed the war. Similar warnings and prosecutions have been used against many Russians who express opposition to the war for any reason. Since February 2022, courts have on criminal charges jailed two and fined three for opposing Russia's war in Ukraine on religious grounds. Another, independent Christian preacher from the Urals Eduard Charov, is under restrictions at home awaiting criminal trial on charges of repeatedly 'discrediting' the Russian armed forces and state bodies. Investigators have also opened three criminal cases against people who have left Russia. Many others have received administrative fines. The government has blocked websites that oppose the war on religious grounds, and those that report on the impact of the war on people and places of worship in Ukraine. It has also blocked websites of Ukrainian religious organisations. Romanyuk: 'Activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation' On 25 September 2022, at the first Sunday service after President Vladimir Putin announced the 'partial mobilisation' of Russian army reservists, Pastor Nikolay Nikolayevich Romanyuk (born 15 August 1962) gave a sermon at the Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church in Balashikha, calling on fellow believers not to take part in the war in Ukraine. Like other worship services at the church, the event was livestreamed on the church's YouTube channel and the recording was subsequently made available on YouTube and the Russian social network VKontakte. In October 2024, investigators (it is unclear from which state agency) opened a case against Romanyuk under Criminal Code Article 280.4, Part 2, Paragraph V ('Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet'). Investigators arrested Romanyuk – who studied at a Pentecostal seminary in Kyiv after the collapse of the USSR – on 18 October 2024 after searches of his home and those of other church members. At a closed hearing on 20 October, a judge at Balashikha City Court ordered that he should be kept in custody until 16 December (Romanyuk appealed unsuccessfully against the detention order on 12 November). It is unknown whether Romanyuk has yet been formally charged or when his case is likely to come to trial. The Memorial Human Rights Centre named him a political prisoner on 31 October 2024. Forum 18 sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the FSB security service, asking in what way Romanyuk's sermon threatened state security, why he had been placed in detention, whether any criminal or administrative cases had been opened against any other church members, and why it had been deemed necessary to carry out armed raids on their homes. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Moscow of 21 November. Holy Trinity Church, which is a registered religious organisation, has several sister communities located in the outskirts of Moscow and Moscow Region. No other criminal cases appear to have been opened against any other clergy or church members so far. Romanyuk: Simultaneous armed raids Roman Zhukov, another pastor at Holy Trinity Church, described the early morning house raids on his Telegram channel on 24 October 2024. 'The conversation was softer with some, harsher with others,' he noted. He wrote that 'special forces soldiers' arrived at about 6.20 am on 18 October at his family's home, the Romanyuks', and the home of the Repins, another family from the church. Officials also conducted searches at the church itself and 'in Volokolamsk' (the church owns land in Volokolamsk District, where it runs children's camps). At the home of Ilya and Sergey Romanyuk (who are among Nikolay Romanyuk's adult sons), the armed men did not carry out a search but 'broke in and put the guys on the floor, where they lay for 12 hours, one and a half of which they spent in light indoor clothes and barefoot on the ground outside. At gunpoint'. At the other addresses, the troops 'entered with armoured shields, in some cases breaking the door frames; they made the men lie on the floor with their hands behind their heads; [and] seized digital devices and documents, Maksim Repin's bank cards, his mother's pension card, and foreign-travel passports'. Investigators asked Nikolay Romanyuk 'to make some statements on camera', which he refused to do. Investigators then took him away for questioning at about 6pm. 'The entire family has gone through great psychological trauma today, but such searches and arrests in modern Russia are predictable and expected – to our great regret', Ukrainian pastor Vladimir Franchuk, an acquaintance of the Romanyuk family, wrote in a blog post on 20 October 2024. 'One of the main accusations against Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk is that he expressed his disagreement with the bandit-like and cruel war that the Russian Federation is waging on the territory of Ukraine', Franchuk noted. 'Honourable and just people in Russia (believers and non-believers) suffer - and will suffer! - for their position as an honest person, which is deeply and consistently based on Biblical truth and the Christian worldview.' Romanyuk: 'Find me in the Old Testament even a hint that we could somehow participate.. This is not our war' The video of Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk's sermon has disappeared from the church's YouTube channel, but several other YouTube channels uploaded copies after the prosecution of Romanyuk became known. (Among these is the channel of Pastor Vyacheslav Boynetsky of the Slavic Christian Church in Salem, Oregon, who posted the sermon under the title 'For this sermon they arrested a pastor'.) Much of the 41-minute video is taken up by Pastor Romanyuk's sermon, during which he says: 'When you are offered a hit, when you are offered a bottle of alcohol or you are given a summons to send you to combat – this is the same sin, and the same drug, and the same Satan.. Find me in the Old Testament even a hint that we could somehow participate. And it does not matter which tsar calls for this – [whether] the Ukrainian tsar, the American tsar, or our tsar calls for this. I would like this to be a vaccination, at least in some way. This is not our war.' 'It was written in our doctrine that we are pacifists and cannot participate in this', Romanyuk continues. 'It is our right to profess this on the basis of Holy Scripture. We do not bless those who go there [to war]. [Those] who are taken by force, we do not bless them, but we pray that they are rescued from there. There are different legal ways to do this.' Nikolay Romanyuk is the brother of Vasily Romanyuk, who was pastor of the Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church when the Moscow city authorities bulldozed its building as an 'unlawful structure' in 2012, forcing the congregation to split across different locations. Vasily Romanyuk died in 2015. The church managed to find a new site and construct a new building in 2016. Pastor Romanyuk's address in detention is: 142412, g. Noginskul. 1-ya Revsobraniy 17FKU Sledstvenniy izolyator No. 11 UFSIN Rossii po Moskovskoy oblasti Vasilyev: Criminal trial of Buddhist leader The trial of computer programmer and Zen Buddhist Ilya Vladimirovich Vasilyev (born 9 December 1973) on charges of spreading 'false information' about the Russian Armed Forces is due to begin in Moscow on 3 December 2024. It had earlier been twice postponed. He has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina. Before his prosecution, Vasilyev had been on the point of taking his vows as a monk of the Soto Zen school. He has been director of the Moscow Zen Centre since 2010, and held regular meditation sessions at his home. Investigators opened the case against Vasilyev on 20 June 2024 under Criminal Code Article 207.3 ('Public dissemination, under the guise of credible statements, of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens [and] maintain international peace and security, or about the exercise by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers outside the territory of the Russian Federation for those purposes, as well as [knowingly false information] on the provision of assistance by volunteer formations, organisations or individuals in the performance of tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation'), Part 2, Paragraph D ('for reasons of political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or for reasons of hatred or enmity against any social group'). Criminal Code Article 207.3 Part 2 carries the following possible punishments: a fine of 3 million to 5 million Roubles; or up to 5 years' assigned work 'with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years'; or 5 to 10 years' imprisonment 'with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years'. According to the Investigative Committee charging decision of 16 October 2024, seen by Forum 18, the case is based on an English-language Facebook post of 25 December 2022: 'Putin rejected Christmas armistice. His rockets are right now shelling peaceful Ukrainian cities and towns. Only yesterday 16 people died in Kherson, where my father's family lives. Or lived? Millions of Ukrainians are now without electricity and water supply'. The Paragraph D charge derives from Vasilyev's alleged motivation of 'political hatred' for 'the current organs of executive and legislative power of the Russian Federation'. Vasilyev made the post, and others on VKontakte which led to an earlier administrative conviction, 'solely out of religious conviction', he told Forum 18 through his lawyer Gevorg Aleksanyan on 20 November. He added that he is 'not a politician and is engaged only in religion'. In a message to supporters, posted on the 'Ilya Vasilyev – support group' channel on Telegram on 20 November, Vasilyev wrote: 'It is unacceptable to be persecuted for posting on the internet, but this is happening under the new laws of the Russian Federation. One day the world will be a better place!' Vasilyev added: 'On a brighter note, I am in Moscow. I continue to meditate on Monday and Wednesday evenings. One way to support me – meditate with me on Wednesdays from 18.00 to 18.30 Moscow time. Unite in person and via video link and our practice will help to manifest the good that already exists, both in us and in the world!' Preobrazhensky District Court in Moscow scheduled the first hearing in Vasilyev's case for the 5 November, then for 19 November, but on both occasions Judge Valentina Lebedeva postponed it (in the latter case because Vasilyev was improperly notified of the hearing details). It is now due to take place on 3 December 2024. At the 19 November hearing, the judge extended Vasilyev's period of detention by six months to 24 April 2025 – he has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina. Vasilyev and his lawyer had requested that he be placed under house arrest instead. They noted that 8 December is the day of Buddha's enlightenment, which Vasilyev had wanted to mark at home. Vasilyev: Earlier fine Ilya Vasilyev appears to have first come to investigative agencies' attention in early 2023, either because of his religious activities or because he had 'ended up on some list of unreliable Russians', as he commented to human rights group OVD-Info on 1 October 2024. The FSB security service examined his profile on the VKontakte social network on 4 February 2023, finding a number of anti-war comments. Police searched Vasilyev's flat on 11 May 2023, seized his phone, tablet computer, and laptop, and took him to a police station. There they charged him under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'). Moscow's Preobrazhensky District Court fined him 40,000 Roubles (1 week's average Moscow wage) the same day. According to the written protocol detailing the charges, police based this case on three statements in Russian from Vasilyev's VKontakte page (which he used under the name 'Arvi Hacker' ('Arvi Kheker')): 'No to war with Ukraine. Shame on Putin's thugs'; '#notowar'; and 'Russian army – out of Ukraine. Putin – out of the Kremlin! Russia did not choose you as president.' According to OVD-Info's 1 October 2024 account of his prosecution, after the administrative hearing, an investigator tried to question Vasilyev there and then in the court corridor about his activities on Facebook and Twitter. In response, Vasilyev cited Article 51 of the Constitution (according to which nobody is obliged to testify against themselves), then went home and deleted his social media accounts. Investigators had already found, however, two Facebook posts which formed the basis of the case they eventually opened on 20 June 2024 (only one of which they later cited in the indictment). They searched Vasilyev's home and arrested him the same day. Investigators sent the Facebook posts for psychological and linguistic examination by the 'Independent Expert' centre, whose 'expert analyses' have been used by the security services in similar cases against people who have spoken out against the war or otherwise opposed the authorities, including in the conviction of former Yekaterinburg mayor Yevgeny Roizman for 'repeat discreditation' of the Armed Forces. According to OVD-Info, Danila Mikheyev, the founder and sole employee of the 'Independent Expert' centre, was apparently fighting in the Russian army in Ukraine when he supplied the 'expert analysis' of the materials in Vasilyev's case. (Russia's Justice Ministry has conceded that Mikheyev does not have the necessary qualifications for linguistic expert analysis. In July 2024, the Federal Tax Service removed the Independent Expert centre from the Unified Register of Legal Entities as inactive.) Vasilyev's address in detention is: 107076 g. Moskvaul. Matrosskaya Tishina 18FKU Sledstvenniy izolyator No. 1 UFSIN Rossii po g. Moskve Moscow: Another 'discreditation' case On 12 November 2024, Moscow's Basmanny District Court fined 54-year-old Russian Orthodox Christian Aleksey Sevastyanenko 30,000 Roubles (5 days' average Moscow wage) under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'). His appeal was registered by the lower court on 18 November, but has not yet reached Moscow City Court. According to the written verdict, seen by Forum 18, on 10 November in the grounds of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Life-giving Trinity in Khokhly, Sevastyanenko 'spoke out against the SVO [special military operation] and accused the President of the Russian Federation and the Patriarch of murdering the civilian population in Ukraine .. in this way, [he] committed public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for the purposes of defending the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, [and] supporting international peace and security'. Sevastyanenko 'adheres to an anti-war position', his lawyer commented to the 'Ostorozhno, Moskva' Telegram channel on 19 November. 'That day, in the courtyard of the church, he raised this issue in the context of religious commandments'. According to Radio Liberty's Russian Service, he told the church's rector, Fr Andrey Tkachyov, that that support for the war in Ukraine goes against the commandments 'Thou shalt not kill' and 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house'. Sevastyanenko believes a fellow parishioner or a member of church staff then called the police, who detained him for several hours before releasing him with a summons to appear the next day for charging. On 11 November, police lodged a case against him under Article 20.3.3, Part 1 at Basmanny District Court. Judge Anna Rasskazova sent it back the same day, however, as officers had not produced proof of the defendant's identity and had cited the wrong Administrative Code Article on a document in the case materials, according to court documents seen by Forum 18. Police resubmitted the case on 12 November, when the same judge found Sevastyanenko guilty. Forum 18 asked the Moscow Interior Ministry on 18 November in what way Sevastyanenko's statements had 'discredited' the Russian Armed Forces. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Moscow of 21 November. Fr Andrey Tkachyov is known for his support of Russia's war in Ukraine. The Moscow Patriarchate sacked and defrocked his predecessor at the Trinity Church, Fr Aleksey Uminsky, in January 2024 over his criticism of its pro-war stance and his refusal to read the 'Prayer for Holy Rus' (Patriarch Kirill added this prayer to the liturgy after the invasion of Ukraine, to be read after the Gospel). The Ecumenical Patriarchate later restored Fr Aleksey's priestly status and he is now serving at a Russian church in Paris (not affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58Auualy6t3vn-8Y	2024-11-22T15:34:23-08:00	
Myanmar’s NUG: A Test Of Ethics And Gender Equality – Analysis	By Dr. Htet Khaing Min The recent sexual harassment case involving Salai Isaac Khen within Myanmar’s National Unity Government (NUG) highlights critical issues of gender equity, accountability, and ethical governance in the struggle for democracy. Key Takeaways: The NUG’s commitment to gender equality is under scrutiny following sexual harassment allegations against a key representative, revealing gaps in its internal accountability mechanisms. Myanmar’s patriarchal culture and the NUG’s position in an ongoing conflict complicate efforts to address gender-based violence effectively within its ranks. The international community’s support for the NUG should be conditioned on its demonstrated progress in implementing gender equity reforms and accountability measures. Since Myanmar’s 2021 coup, the National Unity Government (NUG) has emerged as a beacon of hope in the struggle for democratic governance, opposing the military junta’s oppression. Tasked with protecting human rights and restoring democratic values, the NUG faces public expectations to uphold high ethical standards, especially as it seeks international recognition as Myanmar’s legitimate government. However, a recent sexual harassment case involving Salai Isaac Khen, the NUG’s representative in India, has cast a shadow over this mission. This incident tests the NUG’s dedication to the principles of gender equity and accountability, questioning its ability to protect vulnerable populations within its ranks. This analysis dives into the context, implications, and necessary steps for reform within the NUG. Background: Gender Inequality in Myanmar Myanmar’s deeply rooted gender inequality is exacerbated by long-standing military rule, where women are often marginalized in both public and private sectors. Despite limited gains, like increased female representation to 16% in the 2020 elections, patriarchal norms still impede women’s involvement in decision making. Furthermore, women in conflict zones face widespread abuse from military personnel, as these areas often see the worst violations against female citizens. The lack of legislative protection against gender-based violence has perpetuated a climate of impunity, deepening the challenges women face in Myanmar. The NUG’s Position on Gender Equity Positioning itself as a progressive force for change, the NUG has touted its commitment to inclusivity and gender equality. With 24% of senior NUG roles held by women and the establishment of the Ministry of Women, Youth, and Children Affairs (MOWCYA), it has demonstrated a historic commitment to women’s representation. However, Khen’s alleged misconduct raises critical questions about whether the NUG’s policies on gender equity are implemented effectively or exist merely as symbolic gestures. The Case of Salai Isaac Khen Salai Isaac Khen, a former advocate for gender equality, allegedly harassed a female secretary who worked at the NUG's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in India. According to reports, the harassment began shortly after her employment started in April 2023, escalating as her requests to resign were initially dismissed. Beyond sexual advances, Khen allegedly assigned personal tasks unrelated to her role, which created a toxic and exploitative work environment. An internal investigation led the NUG’s Policy Central Committee to conclude that Khen’s actions were inappropriate, resulting in his dismissal on August 1st, 2024. The allegations of sexual harassment against Issac Khen cast a stark shadow of hypocrisy, especially given his public image as a prominent advocate for gender rights, human rights, and women’s empowerment. Known for his research and publications on gender-based violence and equality, Khen’s actions sharply contradict his own purported values. However, on October 8, Khen publiclydenied the allegations, claiming that the investigation was flawed and that he was not afforded a fair process. In his public denial, Khen asserted that he was not involved in any actions violating PSHEA’s (Protection from Sexual Harassment, Exploitation, and Abuses) sexual harassment policy. He contended that the investigation team never questioned him about specific allegations, such as inappropriate comments or advances. Khen further claimed that some witnesses gave false testimony, aiming to damage his reputation through social media and false statements. Despite the PSHEA policy permitting an appeal, Khen stated that he was denied this right after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs completed its inquiry, a move that he argues violated procedural fairness. Impact on NUG’s Credibility The allegations against Khen come at a critical juncture for the NUG, which seeks domestic and international legitimacy. This incident risks alienating the NUG’s core supporters, including women and civil society organizations integral to Myanmar’s resistance movements. Also, this erosion of trust underscores the necessity for the NUG to implement robust accountability mechanisms that align with its commitment to human rights. Broader Context of Gender-Based Violence in Myanmar’s Conflict Myanmar’s military has long employed sexual violence as a weapon against women, particularly in ethnic conflict areas. Women’s rights groups report routine abuses by military personnel, with many survivors reluctant to come forward due to cultural stigma and fear of reprisal. Unfortunately, gender-based violence is not limited to the military; some resistance groups have also been implicated in abuses, further challenging the NUG’s moral authority. Resistance forces have also been implicated in cases of abuse, as highlighted by incidents of rape and murder by NUG-linked defense groups. For example, in May 2023, NUG pursued legal action against Aung Min, an NLD official, for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl in a Mae Sot safe house for Myanmar dissidents. After the child’s mother, a former teacher involved in Myanmar's Civil Disobedience Movement reported the assault to NUG officials, the NUG collaborated with Thai authorities for the arrest. He was arrested swiftly by the Ministry of Home Affairs, reportedly escaped detention, and has not been found since. While the victim and her mother have been relocated for safety, public frustration over delayed action has escalated, with advocates urging NUG accountability and justice for the victim. Another disturbing incident in Chaung-U Township, Sagaing Region, highlights the urgent need for the NUG to address sexual violence within its forces. In August 2022, NUG-linked resistance fighters executed seven civilians, including three underage girls who were raped before being killed. While the NUG has acknowledged the unlawful killings, it has failed to address the horrific sexual violence perpetrated by its own forces. And other abuse cases have also emerged, such as a Rohingya woman who fled to Bangladesh and was raped by Arakan Army (AA) soldiers, while they killed her husband. Such cases illustrate a disturbing normalization of violence, where even revolutionary factions adopt brutal tactics historically associated with the junta. Cultural and Social Barriers In Myanmar, patriarchal traditions often pressure women to endure harassment silently, discouraging them from reporting abuses due to societal stigma. Women face severe criticism and victim-blaming, especially in cases of sexual violence, with expectations of obedience to cultural norms that view them as protectors of family honor. This cultural backdrop further complicates the NUG’s challenge in implementing gender-equitable policies, as deep-rooted biases continue to discourage victims from speaking out. Policy Gaps and the Need for Reform While the NUG has taken some initial steps to address gender-based violence through the PSHEA policy, Khen’s case reveals severe gaps in enforcement. Women’s organizations have called for independent investigative bodies to handle harassment cases within the NUG transparently and effectively. Establishing credible processes for reporting, investigating, and addressing abuse allegations will demonstrate the NUG’s commitment to a gender-responsive government structure, restoring public confidence in its ethical integrity. Moving Forward To rebuild its credibility and affirm its commitment to gender equality, Myanmar’s NUG should implement critical reforms. First, precise reporting mechanisms should be established, enabling victims to report harassment confidentially without fear of retaliation. Next, enforce accountability through strict disciplinary actions against offenders at all levels, demonstrating a zero-tolerance policy toward gender-based violence. Additionally, mandatory gender sensitivity training should be introduced to promote respectful workplace conduct and prevent future incidents. Finally, collaborate with women’s rights organizations to create safe environments for women and include their perspectives in policy-making, ensuring their voices are genuinely represented. Role of the International Community Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Myanmar have led to a rise in gender-based violence, especially affecting displaced women and girls. While Ukraine's developed infrastructure and international support allow for comprehensive support systems for victims, including crisis hotlines, shelters, and counseling services, Myanmar's NUG faces limitations in providing adequate care. NUG should learn from Ukraine's approach and strengthen international collaborations to improve its response. The international community, including governments and NGOs that support the NUG, can play a vital role in promoting these reforms. International humanitarian agencies should condition financial aid and diplomacy on the NUG’s demonstrated progress toward gender equity, reinforcing the importance of human rights within the government-in-exile. Such conditions would compel the NUG to take meaningful action, ensuring its policies are not merely rhetorical. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for the NUG’s Commitment to Gender Equity The sexual harassment case within the NUG is a pivotal moment in Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement, demanding transparency, accountability, and tangible reforms from the NUG. Addressing this incident decisively would signal to both Myanmar’s citizens and the international community that the NUG stands firmly against abuse, embodying the ethical standards it claims to uphold. The NUG Human Rights Ministry should establish a digital reporting system for sexual abuse cases to facilitate victim reporting. Collaborating with the Women's Ministry can also enhance collective efforts to address this issue. By embracing these reforms, the NUG can reinforce its image as a genuine advocate for human rights and equality, advancing Myanmar’s path toward a democratic society that values all voices. This case underscores the urgency of addressing systemic gender-based violence, ensuring that the NUG remains a trusted symbol of ethical governance in a country that desperately needs it.

Beyond Guns And Ships: India’s ‘Soft Power’ Strategy In Maritime ...	While cultural elements like yoga, Bollywood, cuisine, and spirituality have historically shaped India's international image, a modern dimension has emerged within its strategic framework, leveraging maritime soft power. In recent years, the Indian Navy has assumed a central role in India's humanitarian outreach and maritime diplomacy through Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This shift emphasises India's ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family) and enhances its reputation on the global stage by projecting security, resilience, and regional solidarity. Under the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) initiative, maritime diplomacy is now a cornerstone of Indian foreign policy, positioning the Indian Navy as a vehicle for goodwill and cooperative engagement. Here is how the Indian Navy fortifies India's global influence through a balanced soft and hard power approach and advances its interests across the IOR. Pioneering HADR Operations: India's capacity for HADR operations was first spotlighted during the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, where the Indian Navy's rapid response exemplified its commitment to regional solidarity. The deployment of 40 ships, 42 helicopters, and 35 aircraft to various disaster-affected locations in India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Indonesia marked the beginning of India's role as a regional 'first responder.' Since then, operations like Madad, Rainbow, and Castor have demonstrated India's dedication to swift and effective humanitarian relief. In 2008, the Navy's response to Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar strengthened India's humanitarian identity. Later missions like Operation Neer in the Maldives (2014) highlighted India's adaptability in addressing diverse regional crises. These efforts have cemented India's reputation for HADR capabilities and extended its influence across the IOR. India as a 'First Responder' in the IOR: The Navy's consistent humanitarian support to neighbouring countries highlights its role as a first responder. Noteworthy missions include aid to Sri Lanka during Cyclone Roanu (2016) and to Mozambique in 2019, demonstrating a commitment to timely disaster relief. These actions display logistical capacity and reinforce India's dedication to the welfare of neighbouring nations, a core component of its soft power strategy. Expanding Capacity for HADR: To enhance its HADR capabilities, the Indian Navy has upgraded medical facilities, invested in technology, and expanded its fleet's adaptability for disaster response. Technological advancements like satellite communications and UAVs have strengthened situational awareness, allowing quicker and more coordinated interventions. This comprehensive approach positions India as both a capable and compassionate regional leader. Strategic Foundations: SAGAR and Neighbourhood First: Launched in 2015, India's SAGAR initiative articulates a vision for regional stability and shared growth, with the Indian Navy playing a vital role in safeguarding the IOR. SAGAR exemplifies India's commitment to a secure and prosperous regional environment through regular patrols, capacity-building initiatives, and resource-sharing. Neighbourhood First and Act East Policies: Aligned with SAGAR, India's 'Neighbourhood First' and 'Act East' policies emphasise security cooperation and friendly relations with neighbouring countries. Through naval resource sharing, humanitarian aid, and training programs, India has cultivated strong ties with Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Myanmar, and other IOR nations. These collaborative efforts demonstrate India's vision of a stable Indian Ocean, where regional partners benefit from Indian expertise and resources. Capacity and Capability Building: India as a Preferred Security Partner Training and Resource Sharing: A critical component of India's maritime soft power is its investment in training regional navies. Each year, the Indian Navy trains approximately 1,000 personnel from smaller neighbouring forces, fostering security knowledge and regional camaraderie. This cooperation strengthens the capacities of IOR nations to manage their maritime challenges while reinforcing India's image as a partner in regional security. Asset Transfers and Long-Term Support: India's provision of naval assets to regional partners further solidifies its role as a security partner. In recent years, India has been transferring offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) and other assets to countries like Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and the Maldives. Adhering to a 'Womb to Tomb' principle, India provides maintenance and operational support for these assets, fostering trust and ensuring long-term collaboration in maritime security. Showcasing India's Maritime Diplomacy Through Major Initiatives High-Level Maritime Engagements and Exercises: High-profile engagements, such as the 2016 International Fleet Review and the biannual Milan exercises, reflect India's commitment to maritime collaboration. The Milan exercises, for instance, involve over 40 countries and promote the themes of 'Camaraderie, Cohesion, Collaboration.' By fostering these multilateral engagements, India reinforces its position as a trusted and collaborative regional partner. The Information Fusion Centre - Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR): Since 2018, the IFC-IOR in Gurugram has facilitated real-time maritime information sharing among 25 nations, enhancing maritime domain awareness and supporting efforts against piracy, illegal fishing, and smuggling. Hosting liaison officers from multiple countries, IFC-IOR embodies India's commitment to a secure and open Indo-Pacific, strengthening its leadership in maritime diplomacy. The Role of Technological Advances in Expanding India's Soft Power Integration of Advanced Systems: India's adoption of strategic technology has significantly bolstered its HADR, NEO, and SAR capabilities. Satellite-based communication, UAVs for surveillance, and advanced maritime radars improve crisis response and showcase India as a technologically capable humanitarian force. High-Impact Operations as a Technological Showcase: India's technological capabilities have been demonstrated in critical operations, such as the 2017 rescue of the merchant vessel MSC Daniela off Sri Lanka and anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden. These operations, backed by advanced technology, project India's competence and reliability as a maritime power. Leveraging Maritime Diplomacy to Reinforce India's Image as a Global Leader Building Trust Through Crisis Response: Operations like Samudra Setu, which repatriated citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent efforts to supply critical medical materials under Samudra Setu II highlight India's commitment to global humanitarianism. Additionally, evacuations from conflict zones such as Sudan in 2023 underline India's dedication to the welfare of its citizens and its capacity to respond effectively in crises. Strengthening Diplomatic Ties Through Non-Partisan Humanitarian Efforts: India's impartial humanitarian missions, including rescuing Pakistani sailors from Somali pirates, underline its commitment to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. By offering aid regardless of geopolitical divides, India fosters regional goodwill and strengthens diplomatic ties. Future Supervisions and Strategic Implications Enhancing HADR Capabilities for Greater Reach: To broaden its humanitarian reach, the Indian Navy is exploring ways to enhance its HADR resources. Potential expansions include developing specialised HADR ships, increasing relief storage, and augmenting water purification and medical facilities on ships. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining India's role as a first responder in the IOR. Strategic Implications of India's Soft Power in the IOR: India's robust HADR, SAR, and NEO operations continue strengthening its influence within the IOR. As a stabilising force, India's growing presence supports the Free and Open Indo-Pacific agenda, positioning it as a counterbalance to other major maritime powers while reinforcing its image as a compassionate and stabilising force. The Indian Navy's soft power initiatives, from disaster relief to strategic capacity-building, have established India as a benevolent regional leader committed to security, humanitarianism, and cooperation. By blending hard and soft power, India embodies the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam philosophy, fostering stability in the IOR and enhancing its global standing as a responsible, stabilising force. This strategy promotes regional harmony and significantly positions India to shape a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjYjwOP08pqdw	2024-11-22T08:36:17-08:00	
What’s Driving Decreasing Gasoline Consumption In China? – Analys...	(EIA) -- Gasoline consumption in China has begun to fall in recent months amid increased sales of electric vehicles, slow economic growth, and population decline. We estimate gasoline consumption in China averaged 3.2 million barrels per day (b/d) in August 2024, 14% less than in August 2023. The trend continued in September and October, which were down from the same months in 2023. From January through July of this year, more gasoline was consumed in China than the year before. These trends led us to reduce our forecast growth in consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels in China in 2024 and 2025 in our Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). China’s growth of 0.1 million b/d in 2024 and 0.3 million b/d in 2025 will mostly be driven by petrochemical feedstocks instead of transportation fuels, reflecting increased petrochemical manufacturing in the country. Combined sales of hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles (BEV) were more than half of total passenger vehicle sales in China in October 2024, according to Bloomberg data. This share of sales is up from 40% in October 2023. Credit: EIA Although increased BEV and plug-in hybrid sales are only one factor moderating recent gasoline consumption in China, continued market penetration of these vehicles could weigh on the future of gasoline consumption. In China, typically between 20 million and 25 million passenger vehicles are sold every year. In the future, depending on future sales trends and the number of internal combustion engines decommissioned, BEVs and hybrids could make up a large portion of the total vehicle fleet in China. Although we do not forecast consumption for individual petroleum products such as gasoline or diesel in countries other than the United States in our STEO, we factor in fundamental shifts that affect petroleum product consumption in our forecasts. In China, increased sales of BEV and hybrid vehicles, a declining population, and slower economic growth have limited growth in gasoline consumption. Based on the latest forecast from Oxford Economics, China’s GDP is expected to grow by 4.1% in 2025, which is slower than the 6.7% GDP growth rate average from 2015 to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil consumption correlates with economic activity, and slower GDP growth could also be limiting gasoline consumption. In addition, China’s population has begun to decline, which may reduce total miles driven and gasoline consumption. China’s National Bureau of Statistics and General Administration of Customs publish monthly data on crude oil refinery processing, refined petroleum product output, crude oil and petroleum product imports, and crude oil and petroleum product exports. The agencies do not publish inventory levels or stock changes. Because of this exclusion, we calculate China’s apparent demand of gasoline as refinery production of gasoline plus imports minus exports. This calculation is different from product supplied, our proxy for consumption in the United States, which accounts for stock changes. Despite lacking inventory data, China’s monthly petroleum statistics can serve as a useful guide for general trends in the country’s petroleum market.

The Influence Of Baloch Student Unions In Promoting Separatism An...	Baluchistan, one of Pakistan’s most resource-rich yet underdeveloped provinces, has been plagued by unrest for decades. While genuine grievances of the Baloch people warrant attention, the activities of certain Baloch student unions have raised significant concerns. Groups like the Baloch Student Organization-Azad (BSO-A), Baloch Student Council (BSC), and Baloch Student Action Committee (BSAC) have allegedly become breeding grounds for extremism and separatism under the guise of advocating for nationalism and student rights. Their influence not only fosters divisiveness but also disrupts the academic and social development of Baloch youth. Student unions have historically played a vital role in advocating for rights and fostering political awareness. However, some factions of Baloch student unions have deviated from these ideals. Organizations like BSO-A and BSAC have reportedly been linked to militant outfits like the Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA). These unions often use university campuses as recruitment grounds, targeting impressionable students with narratives of victimization and nationalism. Instead of promoting peaceful dialogue, these groups perpetuate the notion that violence and separatism are the only solutions to Baluchistan’s challenges. Under the banner of Baloch nationalism, these student unions propagate anti-state sentiments, portraying Pakistan as an oppressor. While nationalism in itself is not inherently negative, these groups manipulate it to justify their extremist agendas. They pollute the minds of young Baloch students, instilling hatred for other ethnicities and discouraging harmonious coexistence. This not only undermines national unity but also jeopardizes the educational and professional prospects of these students. Baloch student unions frequently disrupt the peaceful environment of universities, particularly in Baluchistan. They organize protests, sit-ins, and demonstrations, often forcing students to participate under threat or coercion. This culture of intimidation extends to female students, who are pressured to join these activities as a symbolic 'soft face' to garner public sympathy. Such actions not only hinder academic progress but also create an atmosphere of fear and instability on campuses. Education is a powerful tool for empowerment, but the disruptive activities of Baloch student unions undermine its potential in Baluchistan. There have been reports of these unions interfering with classes, examinations, and academic schedules. By keeping students away from education, these groups deprive them of opportunities to improve their socio-economic conditions and contribute positively to society. This deliberate strategy ensures a steady supply of disillusioned youth for their separatist agenda. The psychological manipulation of young, impressionable students is a key tactic employed by these unions. A recent case highlights this disturbing trend. Talat Aziz, a third-semester political science student at Punjab University, revealed that he was coerced into joining a BLA training camp after being recruited at a Baloch Youth Council (BYC) protest. He admitted that a girl he met at the protest played a significant role in convincing him, and peer pressure from his fellow students further fueled his decision. Such cases underscore how Baloch student unions exploit vulnerabilities to recruit individuals for extremist activities. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that balances enforcement with socio-economic development. Below are some recommendations to mitigate the influence of these unions: University administrations and law enforcement agencies should collaborate to monitor and counter the disruptive activities of extremist student unions. Strict action must be taken against individuals or groups found inciting violence or promoting separatist ideologies. The government and educational institutions should encourage the formation of inclusive student organizations that focus on academic, cultural, and extracurricular activities. These platforms can provide students with constructive outlets for their energy and ambitions. The grievances of Baloch youth often stem from genuine socio-economic disparities. Addressing these issues through targeted development programs, scholarships, and job opportunities can reduce the appeal of extremist ideologies. The government and civil society should launch awareness campaigns to educate students about the dangers of extremist ideologies. Highlighting success stories of Baloch individuals who have excelled in education and professional fields can inspire others to follow suit. Many students targeted by these unions suffer from psychological manipulation and peer pressure. Providing counseling services in educational institutions can help vulnerable students resist coercion and make informed decisions. While enforcement measures are necessary, a long-term solution requires dialogue and reconciliation. Engaging with moderate voices within the Baloch community and addressing their legitimate concerns can help build trust and reduce support for extremist groups. The activities of Baloch student unions like BSO-A, BSC, and BSAC pose a serious threat to the peace and progress of Baluchistan and Pakistan as a whole. By exploiting young minds, these groups perpetuate a cycle of hatred, violence, and underdevelopment. It is imperative for the government, civil society, and educational institutions to work together to counter this menace. Through a combination of strict enforcement, socio-economic development, and awareness campaigns, Baloch youth can be empowered to reject extremism and contribute positively to their communities and the nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjY83ZgXm-4UF	2024-11-22T08:31:17-08:00	
Attock Cement Takeaways From Analyst Briefing – OpEd	Attock Cement Pakistan (ACPL) held its corporate briefing to discuss its FY24 and 1QFY25 financial results and future outlook. Following are the key highlights: Company posted topline of PKR28.5 billion for FY24 as compared to PKR25.4 billion for FY23, up 12%YoY, mainly due to higher offtakes. Company’s earnings were reported at PKR3.6 billion (EPS: PKR25.9) for FY24 as against PKR1.5 billion (EPS: PKR11.0) for FY23. The said increase was largely attributed to divestment gains of PKR4.3 billion (pre-tax) from the sale of its subsidiary, ‘Saqr Al Keetan Cement production company in Iraq for US$23.4 million. Earnings for 1QFY25 were recorded at PKR62 million (EPS: PKR0.45) as compared to PKR1.5 billion (EPS: PKR11.23) for the same period last year, down 96%YoY. Cement industry's total dispatches increased by 1%YoY to 45.3 million tons, though overall utilization levels fell to 55% in FY24 as compared to 60% in FY23. ACPL’s local dispatches were recorded at 1.2 million tons, down by 9%YoY. Meanwhile, export dispatches increased by 57%YoY to 1.0 million tons, on the back of 77%YoY higher clinker exports. Subsequently, total dispatches increased by 14%YoY to 2.3 million tons. Moreover, offtakes rose by 1%YoY in 1QFY25, with local dispatches dropping by 21%Yoy but exports increasing by 42%YoY. Management stated that company primarily rely on imported coal, constituting 85-90% of their coal mix. While, local coal component is limited to 10-15% due to its higher sulfur content. Company’s retention prices in FY24 averaged PKR14,700/ton, up from PKR13,400/ton in FY23. Meanwhile, export retention prices decreased to PKR9.400/ton from PKR10.400/ton. Consequently, weighted average retention prices for FY24 declined to PKR12.200/ton from PKR12.400/ton for the same period last year, given a higher export mix. Production cost increased to PKR10.000/ton in FY24, from PKR9.600/ton in FY23. Wherein, fuel cost reduced to PKR5,000/ton from PKR5,200/ton in FY23, due to efficient coal mix and higher efficiency of Line-4. However, power cost increased due to a 39%YoY increase in power tariff. Current clinker exports price hovered at US$30/ton, whereas cement export prices were US$40/ton. Meanwhile, MRP in the local market was PKR1,350/bag or PKR27,000/ton. Company power mix comprises 38% coal-fired boilers, 30% Waste Heat Recovery (WHR), 13-15% solar, and the remainder from grid tariff. Company's current capacity stands at 4.3 million ton following the addition of Line-4 in FY24. Management stated that the company is setting up a 4.8MW wind power plant, which is expected to be commissioned by 3QFY25. Management expects local cement demand to improve in the coming months. Additionally, the company is striving to secure orders with positive contribution margins despite the prevailing lower export prices.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjby51QE7HLhO	2024-11-22T08:27:09-08:00	
Body Image Of Women: Changing Concept And Updates – OpEd	For women, body image is a complex and deeply personal issue that is influenced by multiple factors, including cultural ideals, media portrayals, family, peers, and individual psychological factors. The key points about body image in women include: a. Cultural and Societal Influences: Societal standards of beauty often emphasize certain body types, skin tones, and features as ideal, which can lead women to feel pressured to conform. Historically, these standards have shifted – from the fuller-figured ideals of the Renaissance, to the thinness celebrated in the 90s, to the 'fit' and 'curvy' ideals promoted today. Advertising, movies, and social media often showcase a narrow standard of beauty that may not reflect the diversity of real women’s bodies. This has contributed to an unrealistic and often unattainable image of what women 'should' look like. b. Media and Social Media Impact: Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok can have a mixed impact on body image. They provide a platform for self-expression but also intensify body image concerns by exposing women to edited images, filters, and an endless stream of idealized bodies. This can lead to comparison, self-doubt, and negative self-esteem. Influencers and celebrities play a role in promoting certain body standards, although there has been a growing trend toward body positivity and inclusivity in recent years. c. Body Positivity and Body Neutrality Movements: The body positivity movement encourages acceptance and celebration of all body types, aiming to reduce stigma around larger bodies and to challenge societal beauty standards. Body neutrality goes a step further by promoting the idea that bodies don’t have to be loved or celebrated; instead, it emphasizes viewing the body as functional and focusing less on appearance. d. The Role of Family and Peers: Family and friends often influence body image. Comments, even if well-intentioned, can shape how women see their bodies. Positive reinforcement of diverse body types can improve body image, while critical comments can lead to negative self-perception. Peer pressure, especially among younger women and teenagers, can also be strong, with comparisons and insecurities fuelled by trends in fashion and beauty. Body image is a dynamic, multifaceted issue that affects women differently based on their personal experiences and societal context. Conversations about body image are moving toward promoting self-acceptance, inclusivity, and a focus on health and well-being rather than solely appearance. Development of the concept The concept of body image has evolved over time, shaped by changes in cultural standards, psychological research, and shifts in media representation. An overview of the concept include: a. Early Views: The term 'body image' was first introduced by neurologist Paul Schilder in the 1930s. He described body image as the mental representation one has of their physical self. Schilder explored how this image is influenced by social interactions and emotions, laying the groundwork for understanding body image as a psychological construct. b. 1980s–1990s: Body Image and Eating Disorders: In the 1980s and 1990s, studies highlighted a strong link between body image dissatisfaction and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Researchers started to recognize the harmful effects of media portrayals on women’s self-esteem and mental health. c. 2000s: Body Positivity and Critical Media Literacy: With the rise of the internet and social media in the early 2000s, body image issues became more visible and widely discussed. Online communities started promoting body positivity, which encourages people to accept and celebrate diverse body shapes and sizes. Researchers and activists promoted critical media literacy, encouraging individuals to question and resist unrealistic portrayals of beauty in the media. This included a shift towards valuing the functionality of the body, moving beyond appearance-based assessments. d. 2020s: Inclusivity and the Shift Towards Holistic Well-being: Recently, body image discussions have broadened to include diverse body types, skin tones, abilities, and gender identities. Brands and media outlets are increasingly featuring a wider range of bodies, challenging traditional beauty ideals. The concept of body neutrality has gained traction as an alternative to body positivity. While body positivity focuses on loving one’s body, body neutrality emphasizes reducing the focus on physical appearance altogether, valuing the body as a functional entity and shifting focus to well-being. e. Psychological and Social Impact of Evolving Body Image Concepts: Over time, research has revealed the deep connection between body image and mental health, especially among women. Negative body image is linked with issues like depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, whereas a positive body image is associated with better psychological resilience and satisfaction. The growing emphasis on holistic well-being encourages individuals to prioritize health and mental peace over conforming to physical ideals, reflecting a more inclusive and balanced approach to body image. In summary, body image as a concept has evolved from simple self-perception to a complex, socially influenced idea intertwined with cultural values, psychological health, and media representations. Challenges of body image The concept of body image presents a number of challenges, especially as it intersects with societal pressures, mental health, and personal self-worth. Some of the most significant challenges related to body image include: a. Unrealistic Beauty Standards: Media Influence: Media and advertising often promote narrow and unrealistic standards of beauty, portraying idealized images that are difficult, if not impossible, for most people to achieve. This creates a constant pressure to conform to these standards. Changing Trends: Beauty standards are constantly shifting (e.g., thinness in the 90s vs. a more curvy ideal today), making it challenging for individuals to maintain a stable or positive self-image. b. Impact of Social Media and Filters: Social Comparison:Social media encourages comparison, as people are frequently exposed to images of others who may present their most polished or edited selves. This comparison can lead to body dissatisfaction, particularly among young users. c. Limited Representation and Diversity: Lack of Inclusive Images:Although representation is improving, traditional media has historically presented a narrow view of beauty that excludes many body types, skin tones, ages, and abilities. This lack of representation reinforces stereotypes about what constitutes an 'acceptable' or 'desirable' body. d. Intersection with Gender and Societal Expectations: Gendered Body Standards:While women often face pressures around thinness, youth, and curviness, men also experience pressures around muscularity, strength, and height. These gendered expectations create unique challenges for different groups. e. Economic and Social Pressures: Commercialization of Body Image: Industries capitalize on body image insecurities by marketing products that claim to improve appearance, from weight-loss programs to cosmetic enhancements. This commercialization can intensify dissatisfaction by constantly reminding people of their perceived 'flaws. Addressing these challenges requires a societal shift toward inclusivity, education, and a focus on health and well-being that values each person as more than their appearance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjTXUzSm7OO-v	2024-11-22T08:22:20-08:00	
Bridging Continents: Insights From Ambassadors Of Turkey, Turkmen...	The Turkish (Faruk Kaymakçı), Turkmen (Sapar Palvanov), and Kazakh (Margulan Baimukhan) ambassadors delivered speeches during the event 'Supply Chains and Transport Corridors: Towards Greater Connectivity' organized in Brussels by the European Neighbourhood Council (ENC) and the Economic Development Foundation of Türkiye (IKV). Diplomatic World's Central Asia specialist Derya Soysal attended the event alongside Managing Director Barbara Dietrich, Director Alberto Turkstra. Key Points from the Turkish Ambassador, Faruk Kaymakçı Ambassador Kaymakçı emphasized that the EU is a key contributor to connectivity and highlighted the importance of the Trans-Caspian Corridor. He underlined Türkiye’s strategic position, bordering both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and the investments made by Türkiye over the past 20 years to strengthen Euro-Asian connectivity. He pointed out Türkiye’s connections with Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia, stressing that Europe should not exclude Türkiye from its connectivity projects. According to him, Türkiye is more aligned with Europe than Nicosia or Georgia. Kaymakçı also highlighted the shared challenges faced by Europe and Türkiye, emphasizing their obligation to work together. He called for facilitated visa processes to enhance trade and for quicker access to markets to boost economic cooperation. Key Points from the Turkmen Ambassador, Sapar Palvanov Ambassador Palvanov highlighted Turkmenistan’s investments in the Trans-Caspian Corridor and its cooperation with key partners such as the EU. He stated that, as a country located between two continents and amid the current complex regional situation, Turkmenistan fully understands the urgency of improving transport routes connecting Europe and Asia. He stressed that Turkmenistan is taking decisive, comprehensive measures, working closely with the EU and other key stakeholders to address these challenges. Regarding EU cooperation, he announced the successful launch of a Coordination Platform on Transport between the EU and Central Asia, aimed at facilitating trade and connectivity, reducing transit times, and attracting strategic investments. The ambassador also highlighted Turkmenistan’s key infrastructure projects, noting that the country has invested over $15 billion in recent years to develop roads, ports, railways, and airports, enhancing both regional and international connectivity. Among these, the Turkmenbashi International Port stands out as a flagship project, capable of handling up to 25 million tons of cargo annually. Palvanov noted Turkmenistan’s collaboration with European partners, including the Port of Antwerp and the Antwerp Maritime Academy, to integrate best practices in port management. Furthermore, Sapar Palvanov emphasized that the Turkmen government is working to advance infrastructure development within the framework of its national development strategy. He cited a notable example: the recently completed Ashgabat-Turkmenabat high-speed highway, which spans 600 kilometers and accelerates the transit of goods while strengthening regional ties. Additionally, he highlighted the modernization of more than 5,000 kilometers of railway lines, ensuring reliable transportation both nationally and internationally. He also mentioned Turkmenistan’s collaboration with the European Commission and European financial institutions for the construction of a new railway line connecting Turkmenabad and Turkmenbashi. Palvanov further added that Turkmenistan aims to attract investments and create a favorable climate for investment in the transport sector through initiatives such as the CASCA+ project and its participation in the EU Coordination Platform. He concluded by emphasizing the country’s participation in the CASCA+ Multimodal Transport Project, a seamless route connecting Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and Anatolia to Europe. This project involves national railways from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Türkiye, and Uzbekistan, creating a vital multimodal link. Key Points from the Kazakh Ambassador, Margulan Baimukhan Ambassador Baimukhan underscored that the Trans-Caspian Corridor is one of the most important routes for connecting Europe and Asia. He highlighted how investments in connectivity have boosted Kazakh trade, leading the government to allocate significant funding to transport infrastructure—$35 billion more will be invested next year. The ambassador stressed the need for ports to be better connected, emphasizing the importance of Kazakhstan’s Aktau Port. He called for further actions to facilitate trade and greater efforts to integrate regional markets. Finally, Baimukhan pointed out that Kazakhstan is doing its utmost to become a global and significant player in developing transport corridors while strengthening partnerships worldwide. Conclusion The event highlighted the shared commitment of Türkiye, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan to advancing transport connectivity and fostering stronger ties with the EU.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjfa6spQ9QuM1	2024-11-22T08:20:36-08:00	
Across-The-Board Accountability: The Cornerstone Of Pakistan’s Su...	Pakistan has long grappled with deep-rooted socio-economic and socio-political challenges along with elite capture that continue to stymie its progress. The nation faces persistent issues such as widespread poverty, high unemployment rates, and inadequate access to essential services like quality education and sustainable healthcare. The economic difficulties create a cycle of dependence and underdevelopment. Compounding these challenges, the political landscape remains fraught with instability. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former Prime Minister Imran Khan, has announced large-scale nationwide protests on November 24, 2024, with an indefinite sit-in at D-Chowk termed as 'Final Call'. The demonstrations are expected to intensify political tensions, with PTI leaders describing the event as pivotal in shaping the country’s future. This political strife occurs amidst accusations of state interference and opposition crackdowns, contributing to an uncertain governance environment. Simultaneously, Pakistan is witnessing a resurgence in terrorism. Recent attacks, such as the gun assault in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Kurram District that killed at least 42 civilians, underscore escalating security concerns. These incidents highlight vulnerabilities in border management and counterterrorism strategies, particularly in regions impacted by militant insurgencies. ​The interplay of economic hardship, political discord, social polarization, and rising insecurity exacerbates Pakistan’s challenges, hampering its prospects for survival. On the socio-political front, a legacy of political instability, inconsistent policy frameworks, and an entrenched culture of patronage and corruption further impede reforms. This complex web of socio-political woes undermines the country’s ability to build resilient institutions and maintain public trust, as efforts to enforce accountability often clash with vested interests and power structures resistant to change. Addressing these intertwined challenges requires a multi-faceted approach, where across-the-board accountability emerges as the linchpin of any sustainable solution. Corruption, weak institutions, and lack of accountability have long been one of the most significant impediments to Pakistan’s growth. It bleeds public funds, which could otherwise be directed toward essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The siphoning off of these critical resources exacerbates social inequality and erodes trust in public institutions. When corruption runs rampant, faith in the very systems meant to uphold justice and fairness is shattered. The result is a population that feels disenfranchised, fostering an environment where the rule of law holds little weight. Efforts like the establishment of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) have been undertaken to combat corruption, aiming to investigate and prosecute cases of financial malpractice. However, the outcomes have been mixed, with critics pointing out issues of selective accountability and political influence. To truly succeed, Pakistan must implement stringent anti-corruption measures and enforce transparent processes for government spending and policymaking. Strong institutions are the backbone of a sustainable society. In Pakistan, the strength of these institutions has often been compromised by undue influence and a lack of accountability. A clear example of this is the failure of police reform initiatives aimed at reducing political interference in law enforcement. Despite multiple attempts to create an independent and professional police force, reforms have often faltered due to a lack of sustained political will and accountability measures. The rule of law must prevail, and no individual regardless of rank should be above it. Ensuring that checks and balances exist across all branches of government is essential. It is only through such measures that public confidence in governance can be restored. Reforms in the judiciary and electoral systems must promote impartiality and transparency, reinforcing the idea that institutions are designed to serve the public interest, not individual power brokers. Economic stability is another critical aspect of national sustainability that thrives on accountability. Investor confidence is closely linked to a nation’s adherence to the rule of law and fairness. When businesses and investors are assured that regulations are consistently applied, and there is recourse for addressing grievances, they are more likely to commit to long-term investments. This inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) can bolster economic growth and create jobs, laying the groundwork for a more resilient economy. Conversely, when accountability is absent, the economy becomes susceptible to mismanagement and corruption. For instance, Pakistan’s external debt reached a staggering $130.4 billion in March 2024, debt-to-GDP ratio stood at approximately 65.7% as of September 2024, contributing to economic pressures that further exacerbated inflation and unemployment. Financial instability stemming from unchecked corruption and poor governance has repeatedly led to debt crises that hinder progress. Similarly, public trust and social cohesion are critical for the unity and collective growth of a country. Trust between the government and its citizens is built when people believe their leaders are accountable and that governance operates transparently. When this trust is established, it creates a social contract that encourages citizens to actively participate in nation-building and respect the laws that govern them. On the other hand, when leaders evade responsibility and misuse their power, the social fabric begins to unravel. Accountability mechanisms such as public access to information, citizen participation in policymaking, and open channels for dialogue empower people to play a role in governance. These measures foster a sense of shared responsibility that strengthens the country from within. Equally important is the effectiveness of public policies, which can only be achieved when there is proper oversight. Policies crafted and executed without mechanisms for accountability are prone to failure, inefficiency, and corruption. A notable example is the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), which, despite its aim to provide financial aid to the underprivileged, has faced issues of mismanagement and misuse of funds due to lack of stringent oversight. Today, Pakistan finds itself teetering on the edge of economic collapse, grappling with severe political turmoil, widespread lawlessness, and escalating social unrest. The nation’s systems are deeply mired in corruption and inefficiency, hindering effective governance and progress. To move forward, several steps need to be taken to embed accountability at every level of society. Legislative reforms must be introduced to mandate transparency in public services, ensuring that leaders are held accountable for their actions. Independent oversight bodies should be strengthened and granted the autonomy necessary to function without fear of political reprisal. Civic education must be prioritized so that citizens are aware of their rights and responsibilities and understand the importance of holding their leaders accountable. Additionally, leveraging technology to create digital platforms for transparency – where government actions, contracts, and expenditures are published – can significantly enhance public scrutiny and involvement. Across-the-board accountability, therefore, is not just a lofty ideal but an actionable necessity for Pakistan’s future. It ensures that resources are managed prudently, public trust is fortified, and sustainable development becomes a reality. For Pakistan, embedding accountability at every level from local councils to the highest offices of power – is the only path forward. By doing so, the nation can cultivate stability, prosperity, and progress that can endure for generations to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjSM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-22T08:17:21-08:00	
Trump, AUKUS And Australia’s Dim Servitors – OpEd	There is something enormously satisfying about seeing those in the war racket worry that their assumptions on conflict have been upended. There they were, happily funding, planning and preparing to battle against threats imagined or otherwise, and there comes Donald Trump, malice and petulance combined, to pull the rug from under them again. What is fascinating about the return of Trump to the White House is that critics think his next round of potentially rowdy occupancy is going to encourage, rather than discourage war. Conflict may be the inadvertent consequence of any number of unilateral policies Trump might pursue, but they do not tally with his anti-war platform. Whatever can be said about his adolescent demagogic tendencies, a love of war is curiously absent from the complement. A tendency to predictable unpredictability, however, is. The whole assessment also utterly misunderstands the premise that the foolishly menacing trilateral alliance of AUKUS is, by its nature, a pact for the making of war. This agreement between Australia, the UK and the US can hardly be dignified as some peaceful, unprovocative enterprise fashioned to preserve security. To that end, President Joe Biden should shoulder a considerable amount of the blame for destabilising the region. But instead, we are getting some rather streaky commentary from the security wonks in Australia. Trump spells, in the pessimistic words of Nick Bisley from La Trobe University, 'uncertainty about just what direction the US will go'. His policies might, for instance, 'badly destabilise Asia' and imperil the AUKUS, specifically on the provision of nuclear-powered submarines to the Royal Australian Navy. On the last point, we can only hope. The Australians, being willing and unquestioning satellites of US power, have tried to pretend that a change of the guard in the White House will not doom the pact. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong expressed a 'great deal of confidence' that things would not change under the new administration, seeing as AUKUS enjoyed bipartisan support. Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, is also of the view that AUKUS will survive into the Trump administration as it 'strengthens all three countries’ ability to deter threats, and it grows the defence industrial base and creates jobs in all three countries'. Another former ambassador to Washington, Arthur Sinodinos, who also occupies the role of AUKUS forum co-chair, has pitched the viability of the trilateral pact in such a way as to make it more appealing to Trump. Without any trace of humour, he suggests that tech oligarch Elon Musk oversee matters if needed. 'If Musk can deliver AUKUS, we should put Musk in charge of AUKUS, and I’m not joking, if new thinking is needed to get this done,' advises the deluded Sinodinos. The reasoning offered on this is, to put it mildly, peculiar. As co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, it is hoped, will apply 'business principles' and 'new thinking'. If the Pentagon can 'reform supply chains, logistics, procurement rules, in a way that means there’s speed to market, we get minimum viable capability sooner, rather than later'. These doltish assessments from Sinodinos are blatantly ignorant of the fact the defence industry is never efficient. Nor do they detract from the key premise of the arrangements. Certainly, if an anti-China focus is what you are focusing on – and AUKUS, centrally and evidently, is an anti-China agreement pure and simple – there would be little reason for Trump to tinker with its central tenets. For one, he is hankering for an even deeper trade war with Beijing. Why not also harry the Chinese with a provocative instrument, daft as it is, that entails militarising Australia and garrisoning it for any future conflict that might arise? Whatever the case, AUKUS has always been contingent on the interests of one power. Congress has long signalled that US defence interests come first, including whether Australia should receive any Virginian class submarines to begin with. Trump would hardly disagree here. 'Trump’s decisions at each phase of AUKUS cooperation will be shaped by zero-sum balance sheets of US interest,' suggests Alice Nason of the University of Sydney’s US Studies Centre rather tritely. If Trump be so transactional, he has an excellent example of a country utterly willing to give everything to US security, thereby improving the deal from the side of Washington’s military-industrial complex. If there was one lingering, pathological complaint he had about Washington’s NATO allies, it was always that they were not doing enough to ease the burdens of US defence. They stalled on defence budgets; they quibbled on various targets on recruitment. This can hardly be said of Canberra. Australia’s government has abandoned all pretence of resistance, measure or judgment, outrageously willing to underwrite the US imperium in any of its needs in countering China, raiding the treasury of taxpayer funds to the tune of a figure that will, eventually, exceed A$368 billion. Rudd openly acknowledges that Australian money is directly 'investing into the US submarine industrial base to expand the capacity of their shipyards.' It would be silly to prevent this continuing windfall. It may well be that aspect that ends up convincing Trump that AUKUS is worth keeping. Why get rid of willing servitors of such dim tendency when they are so willing to please you with cash and compliments?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV8oUOrk3WyH_	2024-11-21T18:20:57-08:00	
Central Asian Countries Sending Migrant Workers To Asia Over Russ...	Since the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack in Moscow in March 2024, hostility among Russians toward Central Asian immigrants has increased dramatically (see EDM, March 26, 28). Despite the Kremlin’s need for such workers to compensate for Russia’s demographic decline, Russian officials have adopted increasingly harsh policies toward immigrants, expelling some, leading others to leave on their own, and causing many Central Asians to consider going home or at least working somewhere other than Russia (Window on Eurasia, July 18, 2022; see EDM, May 9, 15,October 22). Moscow’s decision to try to force migrant workers into its invasion force in Ukraine has further exacerbated these feelings (see EDM November 8, 2023, October 31). The Kremlin has tried to hide the extent of this exodus by ending the publication of interior ministry data on departures and publishing only data on arrivals, figures that distort how many have left. This has even led some commentators to claim that there has been no population decline in the Central Asian migrant community in Russia and blame the West for the situation (Federalcity.ru, October 25; Ritmeurasia.ru, November 16). Reports from across Russia show, however, that such claims are baseless (e.g., Infopro54.ru, November 20; Novosibirsk MK.ru, November 21; Tvernews.ru, November 25). This mass emigration has led to two policy shifts, one in Moscow and one in Central Asian capitals. In Moscow, the Russian government has sought to find replacements for the departed Central Asian migrant workers from elsewhere, turning to Zimbabwe and India, as well as to smaller countries in East Asia (Novopossiya, May 31; Versia.ru, October 10; see EDM, February 23, September 16, October 16; Tsargrad.tv, November 16). Appeals to these countries for migrant workers began even before the Crocus City Hall attack, but the recent intensification of Moscow’s efforts both highlights the significance of Central Asians’ departure and is fraught with danger for Russia (see EDM, February 6). On the one hand, migrant workers from these countries are far less likely to know Russian or be familiar with Russian norms than Central Asians whom the Soviet Union colonized and only in the past thirty years gained their independence with Russia continuing to influence their politics. The new migrant workers’ lack of cultural and linguistic knowledge seems certain to exacerbate ethnic tensions within the Russian Federation, even more radically in places where Central Asian workers’ absence of Russian language knowledge and sensitivity to Russian cultural norms have been significant causes of the current anti-migrant campaign. Turning away from the use of Central Asians as migrant workers will simultaneously undercut Moscow’s efforts to promote the revival and spread of the Russian language throughout Central Asia and is already reducing Moscow’s influence across the region. Policy changes in Central Asian countries point to this development, which may ultimately have even more profound consequences. Until recently, Central Asian governments welcomed the role that their migrant workers in the Russian Federation play in helping the economies of their countries stay afloat. Transfer payments from the migrant workers have played a key role in that regard, especially in Tajikistan, and in other countries as well. These governments view sending such people to Russia as a kind of safety valve because even if radicalized by their experiences in Russia, they will not come home soon and threaten the regimes (see EDM, October 5, 2023). Consequently, when it became apparent that more migrant workers were returning from the Russian Federation, these governments focused on expanding the list of other countries where their nationals could go instead, which would help stabilize their homelands and prevent them from coming back and sparking unrest. More than any other country in the region, Uzbekistan has been concerned about ensuring the continuation of sending its migrant workers abroad and is urged by experts to diversify the countries it sends people to (Window on Eurasia, June 24, 2021). Several years ago, under the rubric of promoting a balanced foreign policy, Tashkent sought to promote migration to countries other than Russia, including most prominently South Korea, where 100,000 of its citizens now work, becoming the largest diaspora community in that country (Gazeta.uz, February 5; MK.ru, July 17). At the end of October, taking its lead from Uzbekistan and fearing the consequences of losing remittances and the possible instability with migrant workers returning from Russia to Tajikistan, the poorest country in the region, Dushanbe signed an agreement with Seoul. This agreement paved the way for Tajiks to go to South Korea to learn Korean and work in Korean factories beginning in January 2025 (Ritmeurasia.ru, November 11; For background on the decision, see Window on Eurasia, April 3). The initial numbers may be small, as in the case of the Uzbeks, but will grow rapidly as it seems virtually certain that more Tajiks will return from Russia. This pattern will be repeated by other Central Asian countries as well, which, similarly to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, will seek to arrange for their nationals to go to other Pacific Rim countries. Moscow commentators now say that such a maneuver will cost Russia dearly, and China, Russia’s ally, will not save Russia in Central Asia. Instead, Beijing is likely to exploit this new set of Russian losses. Beijing itself, however, will also find itself in competition with South Korea and other Pacific Rim countries because, unlike them, it is unlikely to be able to arrange for the dispatch of Central Asian workers to China. Consequently, Versia analyst Ruslan Gorevoy says anti-Central Asian immigrant actions and moves may mean that Moscow has now 'lost' that region in much the way it has lost other regions of the former Soviet space (Versia.ru, April 15). Central Asian governments not only are denouncing Moscow for its anti-immigrant moves but are also supporting Ukraine and refusing to take part in many Russian-led activities—despite Moscow’s propagandistic efforts to claim the contrary (Krym.Realii, April 15; Kakaz-uzel.ru, April 12; Eurasia Today, April 16). Moscow officials have only themselves to blame, Gorevoy concludes, due to their approach toward the Crocus City Hall terrorist act. Moscow played to the nationalist, even racist, attitudes of many Russians rather than pursuing Russia’s national interests, which include using Central Asian workers and expanding Moscow’s influence over their homelands. Reversing course now will be difficult if not impossible, he suggests and notes that this is just one more way in which the mishandling of a manageable ethnic issue leads to geopolitical catastrophe (For a useful discussion of how Moscow is now struggling with this, see Russian Council on International Affairs, November 20).

Who Is Bo Guagua And Why Do China Watchers Care About His Wedding...	He has not been heard from for over 10 years, but the news of his engagement this month has made a splash from Taipei to (probably) Tiananmen. Bo Guagua, a once high-profile son of the Chinese political elite whose notorious family drama both shocked and shaped the country’s politics today, touched down in Taiwan last week to make a pilgrimage familiar to many young people: to visit his future in-laws. Yet the public attention on what should have been a normal rite of passage reveals just how much interest there is in this Communist Party scion once tipped for power. Taiwanese media quoted a nurse who laid eyes on him ('he is handsome!'), while the office of the former Taiwanese president declared that he had not been invited to the wedding, which is due to take place on Nov. 23. So who is Bo Guagua – and why is there interest in his marriage? A princeling ‘hongsandai’ Bo Kuangyi, better known as 'Guagua,' is the son of Bo Xilai, once one of the most powerful politicians in China, and his businesswoman wife, Gu Kailai. His grandfather, Bo Yibo, was one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party. Guagua was one of a generation of high-profile princelings whose family wealth – gained owing to a connection to the ruling party amid China’s rapid economic growth in the 1990s and 2000s – made them known as the 'hongsandai' or 'third generation reds.' From that privileged position, he led a visibly gilded lifestyle that included prime seats at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, a private education at Harrow, the English boarding school, and an enviable network of contacts collected from stints at Oxford and Harvard Universities. Unlike peers of similar backgrounds – top leader Xi Jinping’s daughter, for example, also attended Harvard but under a pseudonym – Guagua was not shy. He became known as a playboy, hosting parties with guests like Jackie Chan and allegedly driving a Ferrari to pick up the daughter of a diplomat (a story he later denied). All this came to a sudden, stunning end when the Bo family became the subjects of one of the most consequential scandals in modern Chinese politics— one that has shaped the contours of power in the country today. Who is Bo Xilai and why was he important? Before his dramatic downfall, Bo Xilai, Guagua’s father, held some of the most important positions in the CCP, putting him on a collision course with President Xi Jinping, who rose to the position in 2012, the year of Bo Xilai’s ousting. At the time, the elder Bo had been the CCP party secretary of Chongqing, the capital of Sichuan province. In that capacity, Bo amassed enormous influence as well as personal wealth. As secretary, he developed a political system that came to be known as the 'Chongqing model,' which featured sweeping crackdowns and an emphasis on promoting Maoist, 'red' culture. In early 2012, Bo and his wife Gu Kailai were implicated in a corruption scandal and, shockingly, the death of a British businessman and family friend, Neil Heywood, who Gu was later convicted of murdering. Bo and Gu are now both serving life sentences in prison in China. What happened to Bo Guagua after his parents went to jail? When his parents were facing criminal allegations in China, Bo Guagua was in graduate school at Harvard. He was reported to have been smuggled into hiding by U.S. officials in April 2012 as it was unknown whether he would also be swept up by authorities. Months later, in September, he posted a social media post defending his father shortly after the elder Bo was accused of major offenses, including bribery and shared responsibility for the Haywood murder. The elder Bo was found guilty of corruption in 2013 and stripped of his party membership the following year. His son then kept a low profile in the U.S., his whereabouts largely unknown except that he attended Columbia Law School after he finished at Harvard. Only last week did he re-emerge in public, when he arrived in Taiwan. Who is Bo Guagua’s fiancée? The bride-to-be has been named as Hsu Hui Yu, a Taiwanese woman who Guagua is said to have known for years after meeting as students. One of the details of what has caught the attention of China watchers is the political ties of the bride’s family. Hsu’s grandfather was a prominent political donor and member of the Kuomintang (KMT), while her uncle most recently ran as a party candidate for the legislature in 1992, before turning to run the family real estate and healthcare business. The family were close to the ex-KMT president Ma Yinjeou, whose government was once accused of helping them improperly secure business contracts. What does interest in the nuptials tell us? What might seem like a baroque scandal about a Chinese political insider is still capable of igniting the public imagination.. Slews of news stories have been written about the marriage already, with everything from commentary on whether the marriage of a CCP heir into Taiwan is a good thing to how the Mainland Affairs Council, the Taiwan agency that deals with China, is handling the situation. It also speaks to the mystery that surrounds the children of senior Chinese leaders, many of whom went abroad, have access to unknown deposits of wealth and influence, and will shape important relationships in the future. As for the couple, they have not publicly commented. They are expected to make their residence in Canada, where, according to a LinkedIn profile, Bo Guagua is now based. The wedding this weekend itself is supposed to be 'low key.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV7na3sLS5IiZ	2024-11-21T17:47:28-08:00	
Ukraine’s ‘IT Army’ Has Lessons For Taiwan – Analysis	Today Ukraine stands at the forefront of the world’s struggle for democracy and freedom, but tomorrow the front could be Taiwan. Preparations for war with China are currently underway, and Taiwan has been purchasing and stockpiling cutting-edge weaponry from the West to better resist a full-scale invasion. Taipei has also been watching Ukraine carefully and learning from its experience fighting a war against Russia. One oft-overlooked teachable moment has been Ukraine’s ability to mount an effective cyber defense, conducted by a distributed group of backers nicknamed the 'IT Army.' Taiwan should look to implement a similar framework and develop its own IT Army for if and when China invades. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine unleashed the first all-out cyber war between two nation-states. Early on, many feared that Ukraine would suffer a 'Digital Pearl Harbor' when faced with a full Russian onslaught, but that moment never came. Russian cyber-attacks fizzled out and Ukraine, with help from both public and private partnerships from the West, withstood Russia’s cyber offensive. In parallel, Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation spearheaded the effort to bootstrap an IT Army to ensure maximum resistance. Given the clear benefits of the strategy in Ukraine’s case, the lesson for Taiwan becomes clear: don’t wait until being attacked to bolster IT capacity; rather, take preemptive measures to build the force up during peacetime. The IT Army of Ukraine has contributed extensively to Ukraine’s cyber offensive against Russia, executing a diverse and effective range of attacks. These include leaking documents from Russia’s central bank, disrupting Internet services in territories occupied by Russia, incapacitating one of Moscow’s major Internet providers, and targetingprivate corporations to hinder economic activities. Such tactics would be helpful in supporting Taiwan’s efforts to defend itself from China. At its peak, the group boasted a membership of several hundred thousand. Yet a singular focus on followers can be misleading because the IT Army’s attacks have bene growing in effect and scale despite declining subscriber counts on associated Telegram channels. The primary tactic of the IT Army revolves around Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The approach is simple yet effective, involving the coordination of a large number of computers to launch a concerted attack on a specific network or website. By flooding the target with an overwhelming volume of requests, the system is overloaded and eventually crashes. According to its own assessments, the IT Army has inflicted economic losses on Russia estimated between $1 and $2 billion. Consequently, the cyber warfare conducted by the group represents a novel and innovative form of sanctions against their adversaries. Ted (which is a callsign), the spokesperson for the IT Army of Ukraine, shared that, 'economic exhaustion plays a decisive role in the outcome of conflicts, and cyber operations, including DDoS attacks and hacker interventions, are powerful tools in achieving this objective.' Such tactics, namely the infliction of ‘economic exhaustion,’ would be relevant in the context of Taiwan as well. The IT Army’s campaign against Russian Internet providers led to a disruption of 40% of their resources at one point, leading to extensive disruptions in service. The Russian news site Kommersant wrote that 'the number of DDoS attacks on Russian companies doubled year on year in the first quarter. Mostly companies from critical industries… Roskomnadzor speaks of repelling almost three times more attacks in the first quarter alone than in the entire 2023.' Furthermore, while Russia has invested billions of dollars in its building out its own satellite internet network, Ukraine’s IT Army launched an attack in April 2024, that took out 'two of the largest providers, Astra and Allegrosky' for several days. Building Up Taiwan’s IT Army Assembling a volunteer IT Army presents a significant challenge due to its inherently decentralized nature, where members rely more on their own skills than formal training. Fortunately, however, these skills have been developed by our increasingly digital world, opening the door to normal citizens participating in cyber warfare. In Ukraine’s case, the government has also stepped in to draft legislation that would establish a more-formal legal structure to the IT Army. Taiwan too, should consider moving forward with similar legislation to build a legal structure in preparation for future contingencies. For example, the Ukrainian legislation would open the door to foreign volunteers and potentially afford them legal protections for participating in hacking on Ukraine’s behalf. Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, an Associate Professor in Cybercrime and Cybersecurity at the University of Portsmouth believes that if the IT Army were incorporated into Ukraine’s cyber reserves, it could help offer legal protections for civilians participating in cyber war by offering 'legal protection as combatants, potentially shielding them from prosecution for their actions during the war.' Taiwan will also need to consider the legal framework for creation of its own cyber-warfare capabilities, both for its own citizens and for the worldwide volunteers who come to Taiwan’s defense. Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu has previously stated that the country is preparing for a potential war with China, which could come as early as 2027. If this timeframe is even remotely possible, Taiwan should immediately mobilize all available resources to prepare for this future conflict, as the importance of cyber warfare can only be expected to increase in the interim. China’s deep integration and reliance on technology will also make it more vulnerable to attacks from a volunteer IT army. In fact, successful cyber operations carried out by Taiwan could have the potential to inflict substantial economic and operational losses on China, thereby limiting some of China’s military power projection. Taiwan should actively apply the major lessons learned from Ukraine’s IT Army. For example, as Ukraine has developed a strategic blueprint to quickly mobilize its IT Army in times of war, Taiwan too should create a detailed plan for swiftly assembling its own digital defense force. Similarly, inspired by how Ukraine established secure communication channels to efficiently manage its cyber operations, Taiwan should also implement secure systems to coordinate its cyber army and target enemy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging the benefits of international collaboration, as seen in Ukraine’s IT Army, Taiwan should explore strategies for recruiting foreign volunteers, thus enhancing the global reach and capabilities of its own cyber forces. To facilitate the effort, Taiwan should preemptively draft legislation—mirroring Ukraine’s efforts to legally integrate its cyber volunteers—providing a formal structure that offers legal protections and defines the roles of participants within Taiwan’s cyber reserves. Taiwanese intelligence will also need to identify vulnerabilities, prepare botnets, and establish gateways well in advance to penetrate China’s digital systems quickly. This preparatory work is essential to ensure that, in the event of a conflict, Taiwan can quickly and efficiently target critical Chinese infrastructure and systems. Therefore, to ensure operations can be scaled to wage large-scale DDoS attacks and other cyberwarfare offensives, the Taiwanese government will need to reach as many people as possible who are willing to join the fight. This strategy will likely need to include creating educational materials that can be widely shared on social media to recruit younger individuals who are willing to educate themselves and partake in DDoS efforts. However, not all preparations will be technical. One limitation that Ukraine’s IT Army has faced is engaging with non-technical audiences. To scale the work of effective botnets and DDoS attacks, more people are needed to join the attacks. But the average civilian citizen does not consider themselves capable of conducting cyberattacks. The reality is that anyone can follow simple instructions to download a tool and allow their computer’s processing power and Internet access to be added to the botnet and help flood an enemy’s networks to bring them down in times of war. Ukraine’s IT Army has proved to be an effective fighting force against Russia in the cyber realm. As Taiwan prepares for a potential conflict with China, it must take all necessary steps to prepare itself not only for the physical battlefield but the digital one as well.

Indonesia: Prabowo Announces $600B Economic Growth Plan Despite E...	By Ami Afriatni Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is betting big on downstream industries to fuel his country’s economic future. Prabowo, who took office a month ago, has announced a bold target: $600 billion in investment to transform the country’s natural resources into high-value products. He calls it a cornerstone of his vision for 'Golden Indonesia 2045,' marking the country’s centennial. 'We invite foreign investors to come and participate,' Prabowo said during a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit in Lima, Peru, on Nov. 14. He outlined plans to develop 26 key commodities, spanning renewable energy, fisheries and mining, as part of Indonesia’s downstream industrialization strategy, known locally as hilirisasi. But as Prabowo courts international backers, analysts have raised concerns about the potential environmental and social impacts, regulatory consistency and challenges in sustaining local benefits. For Indonesia, downstreaming has become a buzzword for economic transformation in Southeast Asia’s largest country. By processing raw materials domestically – whether it’s refining nickel into ferronickel (an alloy of iron and nickel used to make stainless steel), or producing cosmetics using palm oil – the government hopes to reduce its reliance on commodity exports and strengthen its industrial base. The concept isn’t new. Under former President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Indonesia banned raw nickel exports in favor of smelting and refining, a move that increased revenues from U.S. $800 million in 2015 to over $4 billion by mid-2023, according to government data. Prabowo’s administration aims to replicate this success across other sectors. 'This level of investment is reasonable over five years,' Wijayanto Samirin, an economist at Paramadina University in Jakarta, told BenarNews, referring to Prabowo’s target. Still, Wijayanto urged the Prabowo administration to avoid repeating the missteps of its predecessor, which he said had resorted to 'excessive tax incentives.' 'To make downstreaming work, several aspects must be improved to ensure that it not only adds economic value, but also upholds environmental, social and governance principles,' Wijayanto said. He identified key areas for reform, including labor and environmental regulations, infrastructure and institutional frameworks. 'The habit of giving away too many tax breaks needs to stop,' Wijayanto said. 'We must ensure that the government receives a fair share of revenue from foreign and domestic investors.' Prabowo’s proposal comes with promises to improve Indonesia’s business climate, including legal reforms, favorable tax incentives and economic stability. 'I think private business wants a certainty of the legal system, private business wants a favorable economic climate, political climate, stability, security, and good conditions, favorable incentives, and these we are addressing,' Prabowo said at the APEC summit. 'We have liberalized our laws, we open the health sector for foreign health companies, we are opening our education sector, we invite foreign universities to open campuses, we are inviting foreign hospitals to open their branches in Indonesia. Indonesia, he declared, was 'open for more business.' 'I’m determined to protect all investments, to give favorable economic conditions, and to be involved in the major economic organizations of the world, and to work together with all of you to create mutual prosperity,' Prabowo said. Criticism But his perceived reliance on foreign capital has drawn criticism. 'Foreign investors often stop at producing intermediate goods,' said Tauhid Ahmad, an economist at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF). 'To go further – toward finished products – we need stronger participation from local investors.' One example of this tension lies in Indonesia’s nickel industry. While the push for downstreaming has boosted exports, the focus remains on semi-finished products including ferronickel, which limit broader economic benefits. Tauhid argued that sectors such as agriculture and fisheries, with high local potential, should take precedence in future downstream efforts. Environmental and sustainability challenges Critics also point to environmental concerns. Despite Indonesia’s pledge to embrace renewable energy, much of its industrialization effort continues to rely on coal-fired power plants. 'Downstreaming powered by coal undermines its own goals,' said Nailul Huda, an economist at the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS). 'If implemented with clean energy, downstreaming could boost economic growth by 1.5 times. But under the current model, it exacerbates environmental damage.' Environmentalists warn that overextraction of natural resources could deplete reserves, turning Indonesia into an importer of raw materials in the future. 'Downstreaming must align with resource sustainability,' said Mahawan Karuniasa, an environmental scientist at the University of Indonesia. 'Otherwise, we risk running out of resources while leaving environmental devastation behind.' Prabowo’s efforts to attract international support have seen some success. During visits to China and the United States after he took office on Oct. 20, Prabowo secured over $10 billion in investment commitments for renewable energy and mining projects. China, Indonesia’s second-largest foreign investor, has funneled $34.19 billion into the country since 2019, while American companies have expressed interest in geothermal energy and carbon capture technology. The stakes are high. Prabowo’s vision for Golden Indonesia 2045 aims for 8% annual economic growth, a figure that economists call ambitious. 'Even 5.5% to 6% growth would be commendable if it’s sustainable,' Wijayanto said. 'What matters is the quality of growth.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVyEdbDNTlv_q	2024-11-21T17:39:03-08:00	
Russian Orthodox Church Viewed As Tool To Spread Kremlin Influenc...	The Russian Orthodox Church is quietly winning allegiance from priests and parishes from the Patriarchate of Alexandria in Egypt with offers of humanitarian aid, vaccines, infrastructure, schools, hospitals and spiritual patronage. Experts say this is a geopolitical strategy meant to help the Kremlin spreads its influence on the continent amid an ongoing battle within the Orthodox Church over the war in Ukraine. 'Most analysts of Russia’s presence in Africa would miss this development,' Bob Wekesa, director of the African Center for the Study of the United States at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, told the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI). 'Because it is not the most publicized of Russia’s strategy in Africa.' Located in the Egyptian port city, the Patriarchate of Alexandria looks after the continent’s estimated 1 million Eastern Orthodox Christians. The Russian Orthodox Church has for centuries been one of the most powerful bodies in orthodoxy and commands power beyond most religious denominations. It is closely linked to the Russian state and functions as a de facto arm of the government. J. Peter Pham, an ordained Episcopal priest with a doctorate in theology and a postgraduate degree in canon law, recently visited African churches and spoke with clergy from diverse denominations. 'Whenever I traveled in these areas where I’d heard it was happening, I started looking into it. And it turns out it wasn’t just one or two isolated cases,' Pham, who has served as the United States special envoy for the Great Lakes Region and was the first-ever Sahel envoy, told Foreign Policy magazine. 'It was a large number of African Orthodox clergy who had been part of the Patriarchate in Alexandria and had been recruited by the Moscow Patriarchate,' Pham added. 'It was very systematic.' Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria has said that his clerics have been paid $200 each for joining the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2021, Russia established the Patriarchal Exarchate of Africa in response to requests from African Orthodox clergy after the Patriarch of Alexandria sided with the Orthodox Church in Ukraine after the Russian invasion. The Russian Orthodox Church also opened more than 200 parishes in 25 African countries between December 2021 and July 2023, according to a report from the Russian news agency Interfax. The Russian church’s expansion 'is becoming a key component of the Kremlin’s exercise of soft power in Africa, promoting many conservative and anti-Western positions,' Charles A. Ray, wrote for the FPRI. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow claims that the Patriarchy of Alexandria will lead the body of believers into the Western sphere of influence, according to a Politics Today report, while his agenda reinforces Russia’s ambitions in Africa and asserts that African nations can protect themselves from external pressures. Theodore II shuns any efforts to politicize the Orthodox faith. In 2023, he warned the Orthodox world of the danger of Moscow’s political ambitions in Africa. In an Orthodox Times report, he said Orthodox Africans are being 'spiritually poisoned by the Patriarchate of Moscow.' Ray argued in the FPRI report that the Russian Orthodox Church’s expansion in Africa cannot be looked at without considering its relationship to Russian state interests. The church is financially supported by Kremlin-backed entities. 'Its expansion, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, aims to challenge the existing Orthodox churches in Africa and to promote conservative, anti-Western alliances,' Ray wrote. 'It appears to be more about enhancing the Russian image and expanding state influence than religious conversion.' Wekesa said the Russian church faces an uphill task if it wants to convert Africans. 'I deduce that the Russian Orthodox (Church) will aim to capture a small elite tied to the top echelons of governments in pursuit of opaque Russian interests rather than winning large congregations,' he told the FPRI.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV-6NLuv7Kb5m	2024-11-21T17:36:53-08:00	
Hermes 2 Construction Permits Approved By US Nuclear Regulatory C...	The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has voted to issue construction permits to Kairos Power for the Hermes 2 Demonstration Plant. The permits will authorise Kairos to build a facility with two 35 MWt molten salt-cooled reactors that would also include a shared power generation system. Kairos' Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor became the first US Gen IV reactor to receive a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) construction permit in December 2023, and now Hermes 2 becomes the first electricity-producing Gen IV plant to be approved for construction in the USA, Kairos said. Hermes 2 is intended to provide operational data to support the development of a larger version for commercial electricity production. Kairos submitted its application to build Hermes 2 in July 2023, and the NRC issued its final safety evaluation for the permits in July this year, and the final environmental assessment for site in August. 'While keeping safety at the forefront, the permitting process was quite efficient, and we issued these permits in less than 18 months,' said NRC Chair Christopher Hanson 'This shows we can rapidly apply relevant conclusions from earlier reviews to promptly reach decisions on new reactors.' Following a new, streamlined mandatory hearing process conducted via written documents, the NRC said it has authorised the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation to issue the permits, having found the review by NRC staff of the Hermes 2 application 'adequate to make the necessary regulatory safety and environmental findings'. The permits are expected to be issued in the near future. 'The Commission's approval of the Hermes 2 construction permits marks an important step toward delivering clean electricity from advanced reactors to support decarbonisation,' Kairos CEO and co-founder Mike Laufer said. 'We are proud to lead the industry in advanced reactor licensing and look forward to continued collaboration with the NRC as we chart a path forward with future applications.' Hermes 2 plant will be built on land adjacent to the Hermes reactor, which is currently under construction. Kairos Power must apply for and obtain an operating licence from the NRC before the plant can start up.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV1JB1Dgb_-Yx	2024-11-21T17:35:20-08:00	
Wealth And Income Inequality Are Essential For Social Cooperation...	By Michael Njoku It is popularly deemed a sign of moral superiority and a mark of the 'progressive' mind to heavily criticize the existence of inequalities of wealth and income within the social order of the division of labor and private ownership in the means of production. However, the sober mind, careful of being unduly biased by errant ideological presuppositions, is often found to hold views that run contrary to the prevalent lines of reasoning advanced by these critics. This includes the validity of the teachings of economics, not on the basis of blind belief, but as an outcome of scrutinizing the logical chains of reasoning advanced and the necessity of certain conclusions, including the reality of the existence (and even benefit) of inequalities in a free-market, capitalist society. This article affirms an economic ground for differentials in wealth and income of individuals under a capitalist system of production. Additionally, it offers a defense of these differentials, as logically necessary outcomes of socio-biological inequalities among acting men within the social order of division of labor and private ownership in the means of production. Social Division of Labor As Means To Ends Classical economics recognizes that greater productivity is to be derived from the social division of labor relative to autarkic self-sufficiency. It also recognizes that labor—the human factor of production—is essentially defined by its variability and differences in capacities possessed by various individuals in society. In regard to this last fact, all that the economist can say is that inequality exists among individuals and that it is causally relevant to the emergence of subsequent differences in outcomes among acting men within a market economy. Mises puts it very clearly in Human Action as follows: Economists must never disregard in their reasoning the fact that the innate and acquired inequality of men differentiates their adjustment to the conditions of their environment. Thus, individuals with varying skills, personalities, and mental dispositions integrate themselves into the social division of labor in order to satisfy their most urgent wants better than they would under autarkic conditions. The Ricardian Law of Association explains the tendency of these individuals to intensify their voluntary cooperation in the social division of labor given the prospect of better want satisfaction. Origin of Differentials of Individual Wealth and Income in a Capitalist Society Each individual, in choosing his career or line of work, goes where the expected marginal value productivity of his labor is higher. This is achieved by means of the price system. For specific economic categories, such as the entrepreneur and capitalist, this is a risky venture implying the possibility of losses, since all actions aimed toward the future are necessarily uncertain. Furthermore, each participant in a given productive venture has claims to definite quantities of output by virtue of titles to definite quantities of input factors in the production process. Also, to the contributions of each participant is imputed a premium, which is graduated according to the height of value attached by the consumers to this contribution in the final product. The interplay of these facts explains the origin of inequalities of wealth and income in a market society. Thus, we can essentially boil down the origin of inequality of wealth and income in a capitalist system to the following factors: a) differentials in the physiological constitution and geography of acting men as evidenced in their various skills, competencies, and intelligence; b) better foresight and correct anticipation of the future state of the market by certain individuals relative to others; c) marginal value productivity of various input factors—implying that only the final consumers, by their evaluations, can judge whether one’s contribution to the final product is worthy of high remuneration or not. Consequent upon the above demonstrations, the Marxists’ claim that the entire output of production belongs to labor, as an economic category distinct from entrepreneurs, capitalists, and landowners, becomes grossly unfounded on the following grounds: First, labor is not the only input factor in the production process; it combines its powers with the natural powers stored up in the capital goods and resources previously accumulated by the capitalists and landowners, respectively. Second, the central entrepreneurial task of directing these factors of production to those lines that aim at satisfying the most urgent of the not-yet-satisfied needs of consumers, and the subsequent success of this task as evidenced by profits, would not have been made without the purposeful actions of the entrepreneur. Comparative Criteria of Justice Under Capitalism and Socialism Every socio-economic system implies a logically-prior ethical framework by which the actions of individuals are evaluated. With the prior sanction of this ethical system, it becomes established how future actions of men in society would be evaluated. Here, we shall look at the comparative criteria of justice under capitalism and socialism, respectively. The distributive justice of a capitalist system is tied to its peculiar ethic of private property. All property in a capitalist society—including inputs to productive ventures and proceeds from them—are clearly defined and can be traced to specific owners. Ownership title to property is gained through original appropriation of previously-unowned resources and contractual transfer of existing property titles from a previous owner to a new owner. Every man cooperating in the social division of labor is entitled to the products of his efforts in the production process. There is no room for arbitrariness under this distributive criterion. Only by not participating in production or by means of aggression and violence by the state can a man be denied his entitlements. The socialist distributive criteria, on the other hand, disconnect productivity from reward insofar as property relations between individuals and input factors are less defined, and given that all the input factors are 'collectively owned' by the socialist community with control of its allocations being vested in the hands of a designated caretaker. Under this state of affairs, income is assigned and calibrated according to the arbitrary value judgments of the planner as against the evaluations of the final consumer under capitalism. This includes the decision to enforce quantitatively-equal distribution of proceeds of production among participants in the social division of labor of the socialist community—regardless of differentials in skill and level of complexity of task. From the above, it follows that justice in a capitalist system is evaluated differently from justice in a socialist commonwealth. More particularly, the socialist conception of justice aims at the violent enforcement of egalitarianism and subjection of the able and competent producers in complete servitude of the less able and less competent. Misapplying the criteria of distribution of socialism to a capitalist system would have the effect of destroying the incentive structure that impels action under a capitalist system of production. When individuals can no longer tie the level of productivity to reward due to violent intervention, they become disincentivized to produce as they would in the absence of violent intervention. Thus, the ultimate outcome of this would be a fall in productivity. There is a critical error in discussions about wealth and income distribution and, consequently, justice under a capitalist system. This leads to a tendency to transfer the arbitrary distribution criteria of a centrally-planned economy to the private property criterion of a free-market economy. When people criticize the distributive justice of a capitalist system, all they merely imply is a substitution of the socialist distribution criteria for the existing state of affairs.

Khamenei’s Legacy For Iran: Poverty, Repression, And A Failing Ec...	Over the past half-century, Iran has experienced a devastating economy that has destroyed the homes and livelihoods of many of its people. Amid this, the crisis-inducing and perpetuating policies of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, as the successor to regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini, have been the primary drivers of the most destructive economic crises in the country. Suppression of progressive forces domestically and the export of terrorism and fundamentalism abroad have led to a horrifying spiral that has eradicated Iranians’ living conditions, productivity, and welfare. Despite the weakening of religious fascism in recent years, the resulting crises persist. Today, the Iranian people must either endure polluted air filled with heavy fuel oil and substandard gasoline, resigning themselves to a slow death, or suffer through exhausting blackouts. To afford a simple meal, such as an omelet, one must buy tomatoes priced at 700,000 rials per kilogram. Even state media have admitted the policy failures of the past fifty years. These policies have led to widespread poverty, technological decline, low-quality production, capital flight, rising unemployment, and inflation. On November 16, Jahan-e Sanat news website reported, 'There is serious contention within Iran’s ruling political institutions over which political ideology, faction, or economic approach has played the primary role in creating the storm-tossed economy… The reality is that various governments collectively cooked up the stew that is Iran’s economy, and there’s no escaping this narrative. Broadly speaking, one could argue that the heavy, enduring shadow of politics—especially Iran’s foreign policy—has been the main factor behind the current economic situation.' Seventeen Years of Investment Stagnation Recent studies by the Majlis Research Center reveal that since 2007, investment in Iran’s industrial sector has been declining, plunging the sector into a phase of investment stagnation. On November 5, the state-run Etemad newspaper wrote, 'Apart from negative events such as economic sanctions and the shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, an unfavorable business environment, inconsistent and unstable economic policies, increased government interference in industries, and similar factors have caused a 17-year recession in Iran’s industrial sector' (Etemad newspaper, November 5, 2024). The Cost of Denial, Concealment, and Refusal to Face Reality Investment stagnation is just one example, while the energy imbalance crisis, now widely discussed, has been denied for years. Policies of denial and concealing shortcomings inevitably lead to failure. On November 12, the state-run Setareh Sobh newspaper wrote,' If there had been room for open media and free criticism, labeled as ‘blackening,’ we wouldn’t be here. Escalating crises in many environmental areas, sinkholes and land subsidence, exaggerated claims of self-sufficiency in food products, and disregarding expert opinions… have brought us to a point we wish we had never reached.' The Crossroad of Misery or Warmongering Recently, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, Abdolnaser Hemmati, said that the average economic growth over the past thirty years has not exceeded 3%, with much of this illusory growth dependent on the sale of the country’s oil resources, imposing high inflation on Iran’s impoverished population. On November 5, Basirat news website wrote, 'All expert assessments predict continued low economic growth and high inflation in our country this year and next. From the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which in their latest reports forecast 3% to 3.5% growth and 29% to 32% inflation for the current and upcoming years, to the Majlis Research Center, which predicts 2.5% to 2.8% growth and 34% to 31% inflation for the years 2024 and 2025.' The news of capital flight (approximately $16 billion in the past two to three years), smuggling (about $31 billion), and corruption (ranking 149th out of 180 countries) is repetitive. On November 5, the state-run Shargh newspaper wrote, 'We are now in an extremely critical situation where risky decisions not only lead to the failure of economic policies and development goals but also painfully impact the frail and weakened body of a society in which one-third lives below the absolute poverty line, and the middle class is evaporating. Capital flights are horrifying. And… a fundamental question arises: Are the first and foremost duties of governance to provide welfare and comfort for the people and advance the country’s development, or not? The choice lies between reducing poverty and increasing social wealth or adhering to specific ideological ideas and aspirations.' It is evident that the regime’s response is nothing but increased poverty, misery, and repression of millions of people, along with the plundering of the nation’s resources and assets for warmongering and exporting terrorism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVxXImImev-nK	2024-11-21T17:29:20-08:00	
Pentagon Confirms Russia Launched New IRBM Missile At Dnipro, US ...	By C. Todd Lopez The Russians launched Thursday a new kind of missile at Ukraine, what the Defense Department is calling an 'intermediate-range ballistic missile,' or IRBM, said the deputy Pentagon press secretary. 'I can confirm that Russia did launch an experimental intermediate range ballistic missile,' said Sabrina Singh during a briefing today at the Pentagon. 'This IRBM was based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile model. In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was prenotified, briefly, before the launch, through nuclear risk reduction channels.' The IRBM missile was launched at the city of Dnipro. While Singh said the missile carried a conventional warhead, she also said it's possible the missile could be fitted with other warheads as well. 'It could be refitted to certainly carry different types of ... conventional or nuclear warheads,' she said. The Defense Department has characterized the IRBM as 'experimental' in that it's the first time a weapon of its kind has been used on the battlefield in Ukraine, Singh said. 'This was a new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield,' she said. 'That's certainly [of] concern to us ... I don't have an assessment of its impacts right now, but it's something that, of course, we're concerned by.' Singh also said an IRBM and an intercontinental ballistic missile have similar flight paths, high trajectories and can carry large payloads. 'But the main difference lies in the range and the strategic purpose,' she said. Also, this week, the Defense Department confirmed that the United States would provide to Ukraine antipersonnel landmines. Yesterday in Laos, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III explained why the U.S. would provide antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine and how what the U.S. would provide is different than the landmines the Ukrainians are currently producing for themselves. 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting they've kind of changed their tactics a bit and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore,' Austin said. 'They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close in and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces.' In the face of that changing tactic, Austin said, the Ukrainians have been manufacturing their own landmines to slow down Russian advances. 'They're fabricating their own antipersonnel landmines right now,' he said. 'The landmines that we would look to provide them would be landmines that are not persistent. You know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate. And that makes it, you know, far more safe eventually than the things that they are creating on their own.' Singh told reporters that the Ukrainians have assured the U.S. that the landmines, when they arrive, will be used only inside Ukrainian space. 'Absolutely they have committed that they're going to use these mines in their own territory,' she said. 'I should have added that they're not going to use them in populated areas.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVx-Jwg1rdqYt	2024-11-21T17:27:27-08:00	
US Court Indictment Of Indian Billionaire Adani And Impact On Ind...	Gautam Adani had allegedly used US investors' money for bribing Indian officials to get big contracts in the solar energy sector Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who rules over a multinational business empire worth tens of billions of dollars, is now facing an arrest warrant from a New York court. According to Reuters, prosecutors are planning to hand the arrest warrants to foreign law enforcement. If executed, the warrant will leave an indelible black mark on his reputation as India's top-most businessman with the greatest influence on India's powerful Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Wednesday, a grand jury in New York indicted Gautam Adani and seven others on charges of bribing Indian officials to the tune of US$ 265 million to get US$ 2 billion worth of contracts in the booming Indian solar energy sector. The bribe money had been collected and paid by perpetrating a fraud on US investors, the indictment alleges. Lisa H Miller, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Criminal Division, accused Adani of conspiring to obtain lucrative supply contracts 'through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors'. US Court Charges A federal court in Brooklyn saw a five-count criminal indictment, charging Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vneet S. Jaain, executives of Adani Green Energy (AGE) with conspiracies to commit substantive securities fraud. They played key roles in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to obtain funds from US investors and global financial institutions by giving false and misleading statements. The indictment also charges Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of a renewable-energy company with securities that had traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2023 and also Cyril Cabanes, Saurabh Agarwal and Deepak Malhotra, former employees of a Canadian institutional investor, with conspiracy to violate the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with Adani's bribery scheme. Indian Officials Bribed The indictment alleged that Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vneet S. Jaain lied about their 'bribery scheme' as they sought to raise capital from US and international investors. The indictment alleges schemes to pay over US$ 250 million in bribes to Indian government officials, to lie to investors and banks to raise billions of dollars, and to obstruct justice. 'The Criminal Division will continue to aggressively prosecute corrupt, deceptive, and obstructive conduct that violates US law, no matter where in the world it occurs,' the filing said. Getting Solar Contract Between 2020 and 2024, the defendants agreed to pay more than US$ 250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to obtain lucrative solar energy supply contracts which were projected to generate more than US$ 2 billion in profits after tax over an approximately 20-year period. On several occasion, Gautam S. Adani personally met with an Indian government official to advance the 'bribery scheme' and the defendants held in-person meetings with each other to discuss aspects of its execution, court filings said. The defendants frequently discussed their efforts in furtherance of the bribery scheme, including through an electronic messaging application. The defendants extensively documented their corrupt efforts. Sagar R. Adani used his cellular phone to track specific details of the bribes offered and promised to government officials. Vneet S. Jaain used his cellular phone to photograph a document summarizing various bribe amounts the US partner owed the Indian Energy Company for its respective portion of the bribes. And Rupesh Agarwal prepared and distributed to other defendants multiple analyses using PowerPoint and Excel that summarized various options for paying and concealing bribe payments and deleting incriminating messages. There are documents allegedly showing conversations and other material records that show money raised from US investors was allegedly used to bribe government officials in India. Power Pacts Signed According to the court filings, following the promise of bribes to Indian government officials, between July 2021 and February 2022, electricity distribution boards in the States or Union Territories of Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh entered into Power Sale Agreements (PSAs) with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a federal Indian government owned enterprise. Andhra Pradesh's electricity distribution companies entered into a PSA with SECI on or about December 1, 2021, pursuant to which the state agreed to purchase approximately seven gigawatts of solar power- by far the largest amount of any Indian state or region. The allegation is that a large chunk of the bribe was directed at officials in Andhra Pradesh. Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, who were working for Azure Power (an Indian company which was also listed in the New York Stock Exchange between 2016 and 2023) joined Adani's bribery scheme, to convince state power distribution organizations to buy power from SECI. Why Is US Concerned? It is alleged that Azure Power and the Adanis concealed the bribery scheme from US banks and investors from whom they raised billions for the solar energy project. 'Adani Green Energy tried to raise money from US and international investors with a 2021 bond offering on the basis of false and misleading statements about the firm's anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts,' The New York Times reported. The non-disclosure and bribing, serious charges, lie at the heart of the US federal probe and indictment. NYT reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 'filed a parallel civil case saying that Adani Green Energy raised more than 175 million USD from US investors'. The report adds that one of Adani's associates was charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). That law makes bribing foreign officials a crime for companies operating in the US. The FCPA, established in 1977 after a series of corporate scandals, makes it illegal to offer, pay, or promise anything of value to foreign officials to gain business advantage. Therefore, even though the allegations of bribery might have taken place in Indian states, American authorities started investigations because the case involved American entities and investors. In Adani's case, following the indictment, the trial will likely move to the 'arraignment' stage. The judge will communicate the charges and decide whether to grant bail to the accused persons. The accused can decide whether to plead guilty or not guilty in response to the charges. If they plead not guilty, the case will proceed to a 'jury' trial. Impact on India and Indo-US Relations The Adani group has trashed the allegations as baseless and added that it will take to all legal means to prove it. But the Congress party which has been accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being in cahoots with Adani for mutual benefit, has called for Adani's immediate arrest. While Modi and the government itself are silent, BJP leader Sambit Patra said that the law could take its course. Experts say that the case will definitely harm the reputation of the Adani group in the Indian and international market especially among foreign investors who will take a dim view of corporate governance in India. Shares of Adani Group companies tanked up to 20% on the Bombay Stock Exchange in Thursday's intra-day trade after Gautam Adani, was charged by US prosecutors. The Adani company, Adani Green, has called off the issue of US dollar denominated bonds worth US$ 600 million. If the case proceeds badly for Adani, it will further damage his position in India. But as Wilson Centre South Asia expert Michael Kugelman says. it will be difficult for Indian business and State institutions to disentangle themselves from Adani as he is heavily present in the infrastructure and energy sectors, which also happen to be Prime Minister Modi's favourite sectors. As for India-US relations, Kugelman points out that US President-elect Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have a symbiotic relationship and some of Trump's key appointees are pro-India, like Marco Rubio (Secretary of State), Michael Waltz (National Security Advisor) and Tulsi Gabbard (National Intelligence Chief). They are China hawks too. And for any US administration, India is key to resisting China's ambitions in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Pro-Modi elements in India say that the US Administration under Trump might cover up the damage caused by the Adani affair and get on with the job of maintaining cordial political, economic and defence ties, keeping the looming threat from China in mind.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV5ksEsZ2uwv0	2024-11-21T17:15:38-08:00	
Trump’s Opportunity To Reset US-Iran Relations – Analysis	Donald Trump is back and so is the 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran to 'drastically throttle' Iran's oil sales to kill Tehran’s nuclear program and its ability to fund regional proxies. But Trump aide Brian Hook who ran the anti-Iran campaign in Trump’s first term claimed Trump has 'no interest in regime change.' That may be true but Iran, and everyone else, probably doesn’t believe it. The Trump 47 officials may soon learn that 2025 is not 2018 and, while Iran was on the ropes as Trump’s first term ended, things are different now. To start, open-handed American support for Israel’s campaigns against the Palestinian and Lebanese people has eroded support for U.S. moves by Middle East governments that might normally favor limits on Iran’s behavior. Saudi Arab’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), declared Israel was committing 'genocide' in Gaza. By using the G-word, MbS has made it hard for his government to walk back his remarks or reverse course absent a cease fire and implementation of something like the Arab Peace Initiative (which has been gathering dust since 2002 and may need a reboot). MbS also warned Israel against attacking Iran. Arab-Sunni Saudi Arabia and Persian-Shia Iran have been drawing closer since 2023 they agreed to resume ties after seven years of tensions. That the deal was brokered by China is a sign the regional powers had little confidence in a U.S. role, possibly suspecting it is in Washington’s (and Jerusalem’s) interest to keep the countries of the region divided. The countries’ military chiefs recently held defense talks, and planned a joint military exercisein the Red Sea (that probably won’t be interrupted by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.) In the civil realm, the countries are moving toward increased economic ties. The presidents of the United Arab Emirates and Iran held their first face-to-face talks in October, and UAE – Iran trade is on the upswing, and the Saudi crown prince (and de facto ruler) recently spoke to Iran’s new president. Qatar (which shares a natural gas field with Iran) and Iran are trying to broaden their economic ties that are largely based on hydrocarbons, and Iran supported Qatar during the Saudi-led 2017-2021 attempt to isolate Doha for allegedly supporting terrorism, though criticism of Riyadh by Doha-based Al Jazeera and friendship with Iran are the likely reasons. After a recent exchange of fire by Israel and Iran, Iran warned its neighbors not to attack Iran or to help the Israelis, and the Gulf Cooperation Council promptly declared, 'Our focus has been on de-escalation.' The Gulf states are dubious about 'maximum pressure' and are concerned it will upend warming relations with Iran and increase regional tensions. Middle Eastern governments are sensitive to public anger over American support for Israel’s killing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon, so will avoid any display of support for a U.S. campaign that may target Arab or Muslim peoples. The countries that signed up for the Abraham Accords may soon look pretty foolish, so when MbS accused Israel of 'genocide' in Gaza he was demonstrating Saudi Arabia's distaste for the U.S. line, unlike the UAE which has increased daily airline flights to Israel. Also wary of a renewed U.S.-Israeli campaign against Iran and the Central Asian republics. The republics are growing their trade ties to Iran, a market of 90 million people, and the host of seaports at Bandar Abbas and Chabahar, essential for Central Asia trade with Asia and Africa. Iran also hosts the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-kilometer multi-modal transport corridor that connects India to Europe, and is Plan B if a transport route through Afghanistan and Pakistan is not reliable. Iran has been actively working to strengthen its relations with Central Asian countries as part of its Look East strategy which has seen increased relations with China, Russia, and to offset the effect of Western sanctions. Iran's Foreign Minister has engaged in discussions with his counterparts in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the other republics and the newly-elected president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, has met the presidents of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. In Central Asia. Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan have all increased trade links with Iran, in Tajikistan’s case to include a defense pact. The republics don’t want to sacrifice the opportunity in Iran, a country with a consumer market projected to grow 11% by 2030. Iran's focus on Central Asia includes improving trade ties, developing infrastructure projects, and increasing connectivity through transportation networks. For example, Iran has proposed linking the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project to its own network, which would provide Central Asian countries with access to the Persian Gulf and beyond. And the oil market has changed since 2018. According to Argus Media, Iran’s oil exports, which were below 500,000 b/d through the second half of 2019 and 2020 due to Trump-era sanctions, began increasing in 2021 and have increased every year since: 'Exports averaged around 1.6mn b/d in January-October [in 2024].' If the U.S. again sanctions Iran, it may find it hard going as the remaining buyers may be 'those who do not necessarily fear sanctions.' Iran has built out its network to bypass sanctions, and has expanded its tanker fleet, though the clandestine effort is not without substantial costs, such as Chinese customers demanding a substantial discount, and the cost of rebranding the oil to disguise its origin. Iran has an oil export terminal on the Gulf of Oman, which was inaugurated in July 2021, and can export 1 million barrels per day of oil. The facility cannot replace Iran’s main export terminal at Kharg, which can handle 8 million barrels per day, but it allows Iran to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic chokepoint and will require the Americans to try to cover two terminals instead of just the main facility at Kharg if Washington decides to attack Iran The U.S. may try to interdict Iran’s oil exports to China, but what will China’s response be if it considers the interdiction an act of piracy? Beijing may decide to provide a naval escort for the oil shipments or may reflag the vessels as Chinese, upping the ante for the Americans. If the Peoples’ Liberation Army Navy, the world’s largest navy with newer vessels than the U.S. Navy, deploys to escort the tankers it will refine its 'blue water' operating skills. The increased operating tempo will also stress the U.S. fleet which for the second time in a year has no aircraft carrier in the Middle East. A recent U.S. Navy report noted on the material readiness of Navy ships: 'several functional areas and subsystems remained degraded or showed declining trends' since 2017, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office noted in 2021 the Navy needed to improve its limited capacity for battle damage repair, in the event the U.S. and any foe come to blows. And if the U.S. seizes a China-bound cargo, then what? The ship will have to be anchored somewhere, the cargo will possibly be offloaded and stored, the crew will need to be housed and fed, consular support will need to be provided, and someone will have to guard the vessel. China is the biggest trading partner for every country between the Persian Gulf and the South China Sea, so the U.S. may be unable to find volunteers for these low-return chores. The U.S. ignored the warning of former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski who said the U.S. should avoid actions that would create 'a grand coalition of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran, an 'antihegemonic' coalition.' The U.S. has masterfully created that coalition by expanding NATO, ignoring the One China Policy, and sponsoring the 1953 coup in Iran that has freighted the Iranian people with more and more authoritarian rulers. But the ascension of new presidents in Tehran and Washington may be an opportunity to start rebuilding relations. After his election in July 2024, President Masoud Pezeshkian announced his program in 'My Message to the New World' and declared his intent to strengthen relations with Iran’s neighbors, specifically mentioning Iraq, Türkiye, and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. He emphasized the need for a 'strong region,' said he hoped for 'constructive dialogue' with Europe, criticized the U.S. for exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and urged Washington 'come to terms with reality.' In October, President-elect Trump declared, 'I would like to see Iran be very successful. The only thing is, they can't have a nuclear weapon.' In 2023, then-Senator JD Vance said that Republican senators who wanted at attack Iran were 'living in the past.' In 2024, Republican Vice-President candidate JD Vance said, 'And our interest very much is in not going to war with Iran. It would be a huge distraction of resources. It would be massively expensive to our country,' Those are hopeful signs of a desire to reach a negotiated solution, but can the U.S. abide by any deal once the ink is dry? Neither Russia, China, nor Iran believe the U.S. will abide by the spirit and letter of any agreement as it has a record of bailing out of any commitments when it is convenient, to wit, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty NATO expansion ('not one inch eastward') Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Paris Agreement (Paris Climate Accord) Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Minsk agreements Open Skies Treaty Algiers Accord One China Policy U.S. intervention in Iran started with the 1953 coup. The U.S. then supported Iraq during 1980-1988 war after the U.S. and Iran agreed on the Algiers Accords (January 1981) where the U.S. pledged, 'it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene, directly or indirectly, politically or militarily, in Iran's internal affairs,' but this did not stop the U.S. from backing Iraq when the war starting to go in Iran’s favor in 1982. The U.S. killed General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq when he was carrying a message to Saudi Arabia in an effort to defuse tensions between Tehran and Riyadh. Many Iranians and Saudis probably think Soleimani was killed because he was working to reduce tensions in the region, which they think only benefits the U.S. and Israel. Then there is the killing of civilian Iranian scientists involved in nuclear power research. No one has taken the credit, but the Iranians no doubt believe it was the Americans or the Israelis with American connivance. Last is the STUXNET virus, a joint U.S.-Israel effort to attack break Iranian nuclear centrifuge equipment which 'leaked' and infected computers worldwide. The Chair of the NATO Military Committee recently admitted the only reason NATO troops are not is Ukraine fighting Russian troops is because Russia has nuclear weapons, which no doubt confirmed the views of Iranians who think the country should have nuclear weapons. Then there is the cautionary tale of Libya’s surrender of its nuclear program, and the mystery of why North Korea, one of the poorest and most isolated countries in the world, has not been attacked by the U.S. Iran’s relations with Russia and China have strengthened which adds to the country’s resilience. China and Iran signed a 25-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement in March 2021. This agreement aims to enhance bilateral relations and includes significant investments from China in Iran's economy. China plans to invest $400 billion in Iran's oil, gas, petrochemicals, transportation, and manufacturing sectors. In return, China will receive a steady and heavily-discounted supply of Iranian oil. The agreement allows China to deploy security personnel to protect its projects in Iran. The investments will also go towards upgrading Iran's infrastructure, and the agreement supports China's One Belt One Road Initiative, by enhancing connectivity and trade routes. Russia has supplied Iran with Su-35 fighter jets, Mi-28 attack helicopters, Yak-130 pilot training aircraft; Iran has sent Russia drones, and ballistic missiles. Non-military trade is also increasing. The Moscow Times reports, 'Russian exports to Iran rose 27% last year, and Russian imports from Iran increased 10%. Both sides have agreed to scale up trade in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, while Russia has pledged to invest an unprecedented $40 billion in Iran’s oil and gas sector.' The Times also notes, 'Perhaps the most important changes, however, have been in transport networks. As a result of the fighting in Ukraine, and in a bid to bypass Western sanctions, Russia has begun shifting trade routes southward. This is why Iran and Russia have ramped up work to develop the much-touted and ambitious International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which will stretch from the Persian Gulf to the Baltic Sea.' Despite its economic problems, Iran has increased its military budget, no doubt anticipating attacks by America or Israel. At the same time Iran has signaled it is willing to negotiate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but not 'under pressure.' Iran’s foreign ministerAbbas Araqchi clarified that when he told state television, ''There is still an opportunity for diplomacy, although this opportunity is not much. It is a limited opportunity.' A recent IAEA report notes Iran has begun implementing measures 'aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile [of near bomb-grade uranium]' though the IAEA also noted that Iran increased its inventory of 60% enriched uranium by 60% since the last report in August 2024. Iran's President Pezeshkian has indicated he is open to U.S. engagement: ''Whether we like it or not, we will face the United States in regional and international arenas, and it's better that we manage this arena ourselves.' And opinion leaders in Iran are saying their government should engage with Trump, with Shargh, the reformist daily newspaper editorializing that President Pezeshkian, must 'avoid past mistakes and assume a pragmatic and multidimensional policy,' though others are skeptical anything will change under Trump. Even the Quds Force commander, General Qassem Soleimani, once mused: 'maybe it’s time to rethink our relationship with the Americans,' though in the end it didn’t do him much good. All that said, 'maximum pressure' is a slogan, not a strategy. If Iran says 'Yes,' will Washington finally produce a coherent, executable strategy for its future dealings with Iran? Up to now its only strategy has been 'more sanctions,' hoping some liberals will miraculously appear and (democratically) seize power when in fact the Revolutionary Guard may take over and finally dispense with Vilayat-e Faqih. Whatever strategy Washington produces will be overshadowed by the disastrous retreat from Afghanistan in 2021, so the U.S. should favor a policy that increases regional connectivity and economic growth rather than carrying water for Israel or satisfying its desire to avenge the humiliation of 1979. Iran won’t surrender its hard-won nuclear expertise and has increased cooperation with the IAEA, but will it ever dash to the bomb? Israel claims it destroyed key Iranian nuclear fabrication facilities but the head of the IAEA said of the attack, 'as far as the IAEA is concerned, we do not see this as a nuclear facility.' Trump will not want to start a war with Iran over its nuclear program as he will be sensitive to the impact on the U.S. economy, so sanctions (and the occasional Israeli attack) will be all he has left. If that is the case, and Iran’s economy and oil export scheme is resilient enough, and Russia and China remain constant, we may be looking at years of low-level 'endless wars' to the joy of the Iran hawks in Washington. And there is a deadline of sorts for negotiations with Iran: 18 October 2025 sees the end of the JCPOA snapback mechanism, the last opportunity for world powers to initiate the snapback mechanism, returning all the sanctions that were lifted in the JCPOA agreement…' If the U.S. rejoins any sort of nuclear deal, it will have to be a new deal as Iran blew past the JCPOA 1.0 conditions after the U.S. abandoned the agreement. If the Americans want to expand a 2.0 deal to include ballistic missiles or Iran’s foreign policy, Iran may suggest similar limits on other countries in the region, and then demand that 2.0 be a treaty to bound future U.S. action, and to exploit differences in the U.S. on what is a 'good deal' that will be all too evident once the Senate takes up the treaty for ratification. So far, each side has demonstrated a lack of empathy for the other, the result of years of successful propagandizing, leaving each feeling more sinned against than sinning. And the hard-liners in each capital believe in the other’s perfidy, see conflict as key to their continued influence, and reap economic rewards from the status quo. On the U.S. side, Washington has never explained to American citizens its role in the 1953 coup that stifled Iran’s economic and political development, though Secretary of State Madeleine Albright admitted the U.S. role in overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953 and called the coup 'a setback for Iran’s political development.' To many Americans, the 1979 revolution and the hostage crisis appeared out of thin air. The U.S. needs to think long-term. Iran’s mullahs won’t rule forever and Americas association with economic hardship and violence won’t benefit it in the future. The U.S. should adopt a parallel effort to President Pezeshkian’s 'strong region' plan to emphasize trade and connectivity which will help the region make up the gains sacrificed in the 'lost decades' of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan. Despite all the talk about what Trump might do, Biden is still the U.S. president until 11:59 on 20 January 2025. If both sides stick to what is feasible, keep their emotions and hard-liners in check, and Iran offers Trump a deal that he feels only he could have made, we may see stability and more economic opportunity for the region’s youth and the start of the banishment of the legacies of 1953 and 1979.

Bulgaria’s Pro-Russian Parties Display Increasingly Open Ties Wit...	By Krassen Nikolov (EurActiv) -- After the radical Vazrazhdane party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (PES) has become the second pro-Russian formation in the Bulgarian parliament to openly display its contacts with the Kremlin, with both parties having a total of 57 seats in Bulgaria’s 240-seat parliament. BSP-United Left MP Ivan Petkov travelled to Sochi on 17 November to participate in the first forum dedicated to 'building a relationship between BRICS countries and European countries'. The Bulgarian MP also met with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who regularly threatens the US and EU countries with Russian nuclear strikes over their support for Ukraine. 'All the representatives from Europe had a separate meeting with the former president and prime minister of Russia, who is currently the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev. At the meeting, the problems that European countries have were discussed, as well as the opportunities for cooperation in the near future, both with Russia and with the BRICS countries,' the MP added. He claims that the meeting with Medvedev at the Sirius Olympic Village near Sochi was attended by 'a large number of representatives from the parliaments of Germany, Slovakia, Italy, Serbia, Greece, the Czech Republic, France, England, as well as many members of the European Parliament'. Euractiv asked the Bulgarian Socialist Party for information about Petkov's visit to Russia, but it did not receive a response. 'The forum provided an opportunity not only for a general discussion but also for private conversations between the delegations of the individual countries. I am the only participant from Bulgaria,' said Petkov. The forum in Sochi was dedicated to the topics 'BRICS and Europe in the context of large-scale geopolitical restructuring' and 'The role of BRICS and European countries in building a fairer and mutually beneficial world economic order'. A few days before the Sochi visit, Petkov also organised a public meeting with Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova at a BSP club in Bulgaria's second-largest city, Plovdiv. 'No matter how hard our current international partners try, they will not be able to destroy our centuries-old traditions, and the Bulgarian people will continue to support the Russian Federation as their brother,' said Petkov during the meeting in Plovdiv. The BSP is one of the parties in the Bulgarian parliament with which the centre-right GERB party of former prime minister Boyko Borissov (EPP) held a meeting to explore the possibility of forming a governing majority. Earlier this week, the Bulgarian counter-intelligence service (SANS) received a tip-off that the closed Russian consulate in Varna was illegally operating out of the city's BSP centre. The Bulgarian Socialists are the second parliamentary formation to establish relations with the Kremlin this year. In August, the pro-Russian radical party Vazrazhdane sent its delegation to a BRICS forum in Moscow, personally led by party leader Kostadin Kostadinov. Before the European elections, a delegation from Vazrazhdane attended a conference of Putin's United Russia party. After the visit, it was announced that the party would become part of the far-right ID group in the European Parliament. With the ID group splintering into several groups in the new European Parliament, Vazrazhdane decided to join the AfD-led Sovereignists group.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVxD7IEgXczxi	2024-11-21T17:09:46-08:00	
Biden Leaves Office But Risks War With Russia – OpEd	Democrats are in a collective state of panic because Donald Trump is returning to the presidency. But Joe Biden is escalating conflict in the Ukraine proxy war against Russia and endangering the whole world in the process. If Trump is a fascist, then surely Biden is as well. While every Donald Trump utterance is given great attention and dissected for proof of nefarious intent, dangerous actions taken by Joe Biden are minimized or go unreported altogether. The corporate media have never investigated the likelihood that Biden and his foreign policy team sabotaged the NordStream pipelines in 2022 in order to cut European allies’ connection to the Russian gas they depended upon. Two years went by before the New York Times reported that Turkiye hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine which might have ended the proxy war before thousands of lives were lost. Even as the Times reported that talks had taken place, the 'paper of record' neglected to mention that the Biden administration and the former prime minister of the UK, Boris Johnson , scuttled the talks and kept a dangerous conflict in place. It is important to remember these and other failures to adequately report Biden administration actions which have very serious consequences. Biden will be president of the United States only until January 20, 2025. Yet with less than nine weeks remaining in his presidency, he has chosen to escalate tensions with Russia in an effort to continue his failed policies and also to prevent Trump from changing them. On November 17, 2024, the corporate media began to report a serious change in policy which the Biden administration suddenly instructed them to cover. Biden decided to give Ukraine permission to use the U.S. Army Tactical Mission System (ATACMS) and send missiles into Russian territory. ATACMS requires U.S. staffing and technical expertise, which puts the U.S. and all NATO nations in direct conflict with the Russian government. President Vladimir Putin already said that such an action crosses a 'red line' and is an act of war. In response to Biden’s decision, Putin changed the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. The new doctrine states, 'Aggression from any non-nuclear state, but with the involvement or backing of a nuclear state, will be considered a joint attack on Russia.' While the not-yet-president Trump is routinely labeled as deranged and a danger to the nation and to the world, the current president is behaving very irresponsibly and risking conflict with another nuclear power. It is not just anti-imperialists and peace activists who oppose this rash act. The Department of Defense, the Pentagon, opposed the administration's neo-conservatives who recommended allowing Ukraine to attack inside Russia. On September 13, 2024, the prime minister of the UK, Keir Starmer, met with Biden at the urging of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is the administration leader in advocating for escalation. Starmer wanted to use British-made Storm Shadow missiles to strike inside Russia. Biden didn’t make the call at that moment but obviously, the subject was not far from his mind. While the Pentagon gave a thumbs down to the plan, others in the administration never gave up hope that they could carry out an escalation that was unlikely to change the course of the war. They added a dose of war propaganda to their misguided efforts in order to make the case for endangering the rest of the world. Suddenly reports appeared claiming that up to 10,000 troops from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly referred to as North Korea, are stationed in Russia and are assisting in the war effort. While there are countless images of the war in Ukraine, no one has managed to produce a photograph or any video footage of thousands of Koreans. It strains credulity that such a presence could be kept secret or would not be documented in one of the most documented conflicts in modern history. In the end, it is the neocons who usually win in this and other administrations. It is unlikely they had to do very much convincing to Biden, who as Barack Obama’s vice president was in charge of the policy which used Ukraine to counter Russia. The 2014 coup against Ukraine’s elected president and the subsequent sabotaging of the Minsk I and Minsk II agreements all led to the current moment. In 2022 Ukraine baited the Russians by attacking the Donbas and daring them to leave that region unprotected after years of provocations and many civilian deaths. Donald Trump has indicated that he would change U.S. policy towards Ukraine, although he also led the republicans to approve $61 billion in funding for this war effort in April of this year. Biden is tenacious in his maniacal determination and remains obsessed with his Ukraine project and with Vladimir Putin. He leaves office with a last gasp, a throw of the dice to force Trump’s hand and give him a war that he would be unlikely to end. No members of the Senate or House of Representatives have raised their voices to sound the alarm about Biden’s disregard for their prerogatives and for the safety of the nation. The corporate media continue to act like scribes and refuse to provide the analysis that is needed to adequately cover this important story. While liberals stay in a constant state of panic about Trump’s appointments and about what he might do as president, the current president has brought the nation to the brink because of what will ultimately be a futile effort to crush Russia’s sovereignty. As we enter a new phase of Trump derangement syndrome, it is important to know that he should not be treated as some sort of exception in the pantheon of presidents. The doctrine of Full Spectrum Dominance prevails no matter who is president of the United States. Bill Clinton bombed Yugoslavia, George W. Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, Barack Obama destroyed Libya, Donald Trump attempted regime change in Venezuela and Iran, and Joe Biden is determined to continue a bloody proxy war in Ukraine, even as he commits himself to genocide in a gruesome partnership with Israel. The U.S. has entered a new and very dangerous phase of its attempt to dominate the world because of Joe Biden’s unhinged determination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV4E55-lr2y1y	2024-11-21T17:08:17-08:00	
Russia’s Use Of Advanced Missile Sends Signal To West – Analysis	By Myroslava Gongadze Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia's use of a fast, powerful new missile to attack the city of Dnipro on Thursday, calling it a 'nuclear adventure' and a stark escalation in the war. The attack has ignited fears of a dangerous new phase in the war. In a nationwide address, Russian President Vladimir Putin later confirmed the use of a medium-range ballistic missile in the strike. Zelenskyy pointed to the strike as a sign of Moscow’s broader strategy, stating, 'It is obvious that Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground for weapons that threaten the world.' His remarks underscored the growing alarm in Kyiv over the deployment of advanced Russian missile systems against civilian targets. In his address, Putin framed the use of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile as a routine test within the conflict. 'The Russian Federation tested a medium-range ballistic missile, known as Oreshnik, during its operation in Ukraine,' he said. While he offered few technical details, analysts said the use of the missile and Putin’s acknowledgment appears intended to showcase Russia’s military capabilities to NATO and the United States. Putin’s announcement marks the first time Russia has openly acknowledged using such a missile during the war. In Washington, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the missile used was based on Russia's RS 26 rubes intercontinental ballistic missile model.' In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was pre notified briefly before the launch through Nuclear Risk Reduction channels,' she said. Strategic escalation Valeriy Chaly, Ukraine’s former ambassador to the U.S., described the attack as a 'new stage' in Russia’s aggression. Speaking to VOA, he emphasized that the strike was not just a challenge to Ukraine but also to its Western allies. 'This isn’t just about Ukraine,' Chaly said. 'It’s a challenge to the European security system and the United States. Moscow is signaling its readiness to escalate dramatically to influence the West.' He said that the response to the attack 'must be clear, united, and decisive — anything less risks emboldening Russia and jeopardizing global security.' Western leaders quickly condemned the strike. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled it 'reckless and dangerous,' while EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano described it as a 'qualitative escalation' in Russia’s tactics. Dnipro attack The missile targeted industrial facilities in Dnipro, injuring two people and causing significant damage. Ukrainian officials initially suggested the use of an ICBM, or intercontinental ballistic missile, citing the weapon’s speed and trajectory. Some analysts, including those in the U.S., believed it was more likely a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile, consistent with Putin’s confirmation. Dnipro residents, accustomed to regular air-raid sirens and missile attacks, reported that this strike felt uniquely different. Oleksiy Poltorazky, a local resident, recounted: 'We’ve learned to recognize the sounds of different missile types. This one was different — it hit almost immediately after the siren. Many here believe it was a ballistic missile because there was no usual warning sound.' The speed and power of the strike left many shaken. Poltorazky, however, remained resolute. 'There’s no panic, no apocalypse as everyone says. We have to live through this, raise our kids, protect our families and work. We have to fight and do everything possible for our country,' he told VOA. George Barros, an expert on the Russia team at the Institute for the Study of War, told VOA that Ukrainians should try not to overreact to the attack. 'It seems that the Russians targeted the city with an R-26 IRBM,' Barros said, referring to a Soviet-era intermediate-range missile. 'The main thing is to not panic. There's no reason to think that Putin’s likelihood to use a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction is any higher than at other points in the war. 'This is not the first time that Russia has used nuclear-capable weapon systems against Ukraine,' he said. 'Russia regularly uses Iskander nuclear-capable weapons, and this appears to be a signaling effort designed to deter further Western support for Ukraine.' Strategic ambiguity While Putin confirmed the missile test, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova provided limited details about the strike. Zakharova was reportedly instructed not to address the attack at all during a Thursday press conference. The calculated reticence deepens global unease, as Moscow oscillates between overt warnings and veiled threats, said some analysts, suggesting the ambiguity is part of a broader strategy to keep Western nations uncertain about Russia’s next moves.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV_f6SFsl4cye	2024-11-21T17:02:32-08:00	
Fallacies And Frames: The Theoretical Roots Of Logical Fallacies ...	The Frankfurt School, a prominent intellectual movement originating from the Institute for Social Research in Germany, offers profound insights into power, domination, and emancipation that continue to resonate in the study of International Relations (IR). Rooted in Marxist critique and critical theory, this school of thought challenges traditional paradigms, emphasizing the intersection of ideology, culture, and power in understanding global politics. Thinkers such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, and Jürgen Habermas significantly contributed to shaping this intellectual tradition, which has profoundly influenced critical IR theory. At its core, the Frankfurt School sought to critique and transcend the limitations of orthodox Marxism. Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment underscored how Enlightenment rationality, once a tool of liberation, had morphed into an instrument of domination under modern capitalism. This critique finds parallels in IR, particularly in the analysis of global structures that perpetuate inequality and hegemony. By challenging the neutrality of power structures, the Frankfurt School paved the way for examining how international institutions, economic systems, and cultural hegemonies sustain domination on a global scale. Herbert Marcuse, another leading figure, extended this critique by exploring the role of technological rationality in reinforcing domination. His work, particularly One-Dimensional Man, critiques the ways in which advanced industrial societies stifle dissent and perpetuate conformity. In IR, this perspective sheds light on how technological advancements and global institutions are co-opted to maintain existing power hierarchies. Marcuse's emphasis on the potential for resistance and alternative futures aligns with the critical theory's emancipatory aspirations, inspiring scholars to envision a more just international order. Walter Benjamin, though less directly associated with IR, offers valuable insights through his analysis of history and culture. In his Theses on the Philosophy of History, Benjamin critiques the triumphalist narratives of progress, emphasizing the need to recover marginalized voices and histories. This perspective has profound implications for IR, particularly in postcolonial studies and critiques of Eurocentrism. By interrogating the dominant narratives that underpin international relations, Benjamin's ideas encourage a reevaluation of the global order through the lens of historical justice and cultural plurality. Jürgen Habermas, a second-generation Frankfurt School thinker, bridges the critical theory of his predecessors with contemporary debates in IR. His theory of communicative action emphasizes the role of dialogue and consensus in overcoming domination. In IR, Habermas's ideas have influenced deliberative democracy and global governance theories, advocating for inclusive and participatory frameworks in international institutions. His work highlights the potential for rational discourse to mediate conflicts and foster cooperation, offering a normative vision for global politics. The Frankfurt School's critique of ideology is particularly relevant to IR. Antonio Gramsci's concept of cultural hegemony, though not directly part of the Frankfurt School, aligns with its emphasis on the role of culture in sustaining power structures. Critical theorists in IR have drawn on these ideas to analyze how dominant ideologies shape international norms, policies, and institutions. For example, the neoliberal economic order, often presented as natural and inevitable, can be deconstructed through the lens of critical theory to reveal its ideological underpinnings and inequitable consequences. The school's emphasis on emancipation also resonates in IR. Critical theorists such as Robert W. Cox have explicitly linked the Frankfurt School's insights to the study of global politics. Cox's distinction between problem-solving and critical theories underscores the need to question the underlying power structures that shape international relations. By challenging the status quo, critical theory opens possibilities for transformative change, advocating for an IR that prioritizes human emancipation over state-centric power politics. Moreover, the Frankfurt School's focus on the interconnection of economy and culture provides a robust framework for analyzing globalization. Globalization, often celebrated as a force for economic integration and cultural exchange, can also perpetuate exploitation and homogenization. Critical theory interrogates the capitalist logic underpinning globalization, exposing its role in exacerbating inequality and eroding local cultures. This critique extends to the international financial institutions, trade regimes, and transnational corporations that shape the global economic order, offering a counter-narrative to neoliberal triumphalism. The environmental crisis presents another arena where the Frankfurt School's ideas are increasingly relevant. Marcuse's critique of technological rationality anticipates many of the challenges posed by environmental degradation. His call for a more harmonious relationship between humanity and nature aligns with contemporary ecological movements that challenge the exploitative logic of global capitalism. In IR, critical theorists have built on these insights to advocate for sustainable and equitable approaches to global environmental governance, highlighting the intersection of ecological and social justice. The Frankfurt School's legacy in IR is also evident in its engagement with identity and resistance. Adorno's concept of the negative dialectic emphasizes the importance of resisting totalizing frameworks and embracing difference. This perspective has influenced critical approaches to identity politics in IR, particularly in feminist and postcolonial studies. By foregrounding the voices of marginalized groups, these approaches challenge the dominant narratives that perpetuate exclusion and inequality in the global arena. In contemporary IR, the Frankfurt School's influence is evident in the rise of critical theory as a distinct paradigm. Scholars such as Andrew Linklater and Richard Ashley have drawn on its insights to challenge mainstream IR theories, advocating for a more inclusive and normative approach to global politics. Linklater's work, for example, explores the potential for cosmopolitan ethics and global citizenship to transcend the limitations of state-centric paradigms. Similarly, Ashley's critique of realism and neoliberalism highlights the role of critical theory in exposing the ideological assumptions underlying dominant IR frameworks. Despite its contributions, the Frankfurt School's relevance to IR has been critiqued on several grounds. Its abstract and often pessimistic tone has led some to question its applicability to concrete policy issues. Moreover, its Eurocentric focus has been criticized for overlooking the diversity of perspectives in the global South. Nevertheless, the Frankfurt School's emphasis on power, ideology, and emancipation continues to inspire critical scholarship in IR, encouraging a more reflective and inclusive approach to global politics. The Frankfurt School's critical theory offers a powerful lens for understanding and challenging the complexities of international relations. Through the works of thinkers like Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Benjamin, and Habermas, it provides a framework for interrogating the ideological, cultural, and structural dimensions of global politics. By emphasizing emancipation and resistance, it encourages scholars and practitioners to envision alternative futures that prioritize justice and equity. As the global order faces unprecedented challenges, from environmental crises to rising authoritarianism, the Frankfurt School's insights remain as relevant as ever, offering a beacon for transformative change in international relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV1pYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-21T16:59:35-08:00	
ICC Issues Warrants For Israel’s Netanyahu, Gallant, Hamas Milita...	(RFE/RL) -- The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Muhammad Deif, a military commander in the Iran-backed group Hamas, alleging they committed crimes against humanity in the ongoing Gaza war. All three are accused of committing war crimes connected to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, an EU- and U.S-designated terrorist organization that is part of Tehran's network of proxies in the Middle East, and Israel's subsequent military intervention in the Gaza Strip. Iran's backing of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-supported militant group and political party that controls much of the southern part of Israel's neighbor, Lebanon, has sparked fears that the war in the Gaza Strip will engulf the Middle East. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the European Union blacklists its armed wing but not its political party. Hezbollah’s political party has seats in the Lebanese parliament. The court said the warrants had been classified as 'secret' to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of the investigations.Israel, which claims it killed Deif in July, blasted the move as 'a dark moment for the ICC.' Hamas, which has never officially acknowledged Deif's death, called the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant an 'important step toward justice.' The ICC said it had issued the arrest warrant for Deif as the prosecutor had not been able to determine whether he was dead. His warrant shows charges of mass killings during the October 7 attack on Israel that left some 1,200 dead, as well as charges of rape and the taking of around 240 hostages in the attack. 'The Chamber considered that there are reasonable grounds to believe that both [Israeli] individuals intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity, from at least 8 October 2023 to 20 May 2024,' the ICC said in a statement. 'This finding is based on the role of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant in impeding humanitarian aid in violation of international humanitarian law and their failure to facilitate relief by all means at its disposal,' it said.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called the move against Netanyahu and Gallant 'absurd' in a post on X, saying it was an attack of Israel's right to self-defense.'A dark moment for the ICC in The Hague, in which it lost all legitimacy for its existence and activity,' Sa'ar said. Tehran has yet to comment publicly on the warrants. Neither the United States nor Israel have recognized the ICC's jurisdiction. A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson said Washington 'fundamentally rejects' the issuance of the arrest warrants and 'the troubling process errors that led to this decision. Meanwhile, the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a post on X that ICC decisions 'are binding on all states party to the Rome Statute, which includes all EU Member States.' The court said Israel's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction was not required. However, the court itself has no law enforcement levers to enforce warrants and relies on cooperation from its member states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV5p-cVEvAVVq	2024-11-21T16:57:49-08:00	
Hezbollah Causing The Destruction Of Itself And Lebanon – OpEd	By Khaled Abou Zahr It is undeniable that Hezbollah is being hit and destroyed like never before. It hit Israel with extreme violence at the beginning of the Gaza war to try and extract gains. This message of violence has been answered by Israel in multiples and it is now inflicting a total reckoning on Hezbollah. This has also come at the price of the destruction of Lebanon and Lebanese lives. Hezbollah, through its actions, has brought chaos to Lebanon, just like in 2006. Yet, this time, while Israel refuses any mediation (and why would Tel Aviv accept it?), opposition groups in Lebanon have become much more vocal than in the past. They are now clearly and openly accusing Hezbollah of being responsible for this destruction. It has, through another reckless and unilateral decision of war, brought even more despair to Lebanon. It is clear now that Hezbollah, despite its declarations, is unable to cope with Israel’s superior capabilities. The question of the timing of the exploding pager operation —which, we must remember, even injured the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon — has now been answered. Yet, the main question is what Hezbollah will do in the face of this mounting external and internal pressure. The answer is the same as in the past: violence against the Lebanese. Whenever Hezbollah or the Syrian regime — its predecessor as occupier of Lebanon — were pressured externally, they chose to assassinate Lebanese. We are now back to the UN Security Council Resolution 1559 scenario of extreme pressure, which led to the waves of assassinations we all remember. And so, because it is weakened and unable to match Israel militarily, Hezbollah will go after the Lebanese voices of freedom. On top of the horrors of death of the current war due to this group’s unilateral decision, it will also add the death of its critics and opponents. The momentum for these actions has already been set in the same way as in the past. A clear indicator is an increase in the number of accusations of treason against journalists and truly free voices, mainly through social media for now. Once again, lists are circulating. While in the past they were spread via rumors and taxi drivers, now these lists circulate openly on social media and WhatsApp. This season of threats has even added video clips of the filthiest kind, created by artificial intelligence, to dehumanize its critics. It is the signature of this group and a sign of its level of despair. The pressure of potential defeat has not only contributed to the destruction of Hezbollah’s infrastructure, but also its image of might and strength. Despite the destruction the Lebanese are enduring, they are still seeing hope and a potential end to this never-ending cycle of violence. They are now clearly articulating the way out, which is by openly requesting for Hezbollah to surrender its weapons to the Lebanese Armed Forces. In response, the group is accusing the Lebanese opposition of seeking to use the Israelis to strengthen their position against it. This increase in blaming Hezbollah for the situation and the growing defiance, along with the demand to an end of its special status, is something the armed militia will look to quell with brutal force. It will look to do so before the end of the war, despite what its internet influencers are stating. Hezbollah knows, just like the Syrian regime did in the past, that its violence against the Lebanese will kill two birds with one stone. The first is to reestablish deterrence, not toward Tel Aviv but the voices of freedom in Lebanon, and the second is to add pressure to the international mediation efforts to stop the war. Unsurprisingly, these are the methods of an occupying force. And we also need to remind people that, in October 2023, the only occupying force was Hezbollah. I am indeed rehashing myself when I state that Israel was no longer occupying Lebanon following its unilateral withdrawal in 2000. There was hence no reason for Lebanon’s involvement. Everyone is heartbroken and despairing when seeing the destruction taking place today. Yet, the Lebanese pundits that do not condemn, first and foremost, the action that led to this expected Israeli reaction are and will always be accomplices in the violence that Hezbollah inflicted yesterday and will inflict tomorrow and every day on the free Lebanese. They are accomplices in the violence against journalists we have already witnessed, which is nothing but a trial balloon for what is to come. We are now in Hezbollah’s intimidation phase. Despite the war, it must be denounced and vehemently opposed to stop the next phase of possible assassinations. Moreover, if people do not stand up for Lebanon now, they will live under the rubble and foreign domination in this never-ending cycle. We are also noticing a tentative effort by Hezbollah to break the opposition by accusing some of treason and threatening them, while praising others for standing with the refugees from the south. These are futile methods that everyone should be aware of and reject. Hezbollah is now demonizing its critics in the worst possible way. The same methodology was used before assassinating former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Gebran Tueni, Samir Kassir, George Hawi, Pierre Gemayel, Walid Eido, Antoine Ghanem, Francois Al-Hajj, Mohammed Chatah and Lokman Slim. The same volatile situation and pressure on Hezbollah exist today as during the waves of assassination of the past. Hezbollah has caused, just like in 2006 and for absolutely no reason, the destruction of Lebanon. As it faces a close to existential threat of annihilation and is unable to answer the Israelis, it will fight the Lebanese who are honorable and courageous enough to demand the surrender of its military arsenal. This time, the voices of freedom need to win. Khaled Abou Zahr is the founder of SpaceQuest Ventures, a space-focused investment platform.

NASA: Mystery Of Life’s Handedness Deepens	The mystery of why life uses molecules with specific orientations has deepened with a NASA-funded discovery that RNA — a key molecule thought to have potentially held the instructions for life before DNA emerged — can favor making the building blocks of proteins in either the left-hand or the right-hand orientation. Resolving this mystery could provide clues to the origin of life. The findings appear in research recently published in Nature Communications. Proteins are the workhorse molecules of life, used in everything from structures like hair to enzymes (catalysts that speed up or regulate chemical reactions). Just as the 26 letters of the alphabet are arranged in limitless combinations to make words, life uses 20 different amino acid building blocks in a huge variety of arrangements to make millions of different proteins. Some amino acid molecules can be built in two ways, such that mirror-image versions exist, like your hands, and life uses the left-handed variety of these amino acids. Although life based on right-handed amino acids would presumably work fine, the two mirror images are rarely mixed in biology, a characteristic of life called homochirality. It is a mystery to scientists why life chose the left-handed variety over the right-handed one. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that holds the instructions for building and running a living organism. However, DNA is complex and specialized; it 'subcontracts' the work of reading the instructions to RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules and building proteins to ribosome molecules. DNA’s specialization and complexity lead scientists to think that something simpler should have preceded it billions of years ago during the early evolution of life. A leading candidate for this is RNA, which can both store genetic information and build proteins. The hypothesis that RNA may have preceded DNA is called the 'RNA world' hypothesis. If the RNA world proposition is correct, then perhaps something about RNA caused it to favor building left-handed proteins over right-handed ones. However, the new work did not support this idea, deepening the mystery of why life went with left-handed proteins. The experiment tested RNA molecules that act like enzymes to build proteins, called ribozymes. 'The experiment demonstrated that ribozymes can favor either left- or right-handed amino acids, indicating that RNA worlds, in general, would not necessarily have a strong bias for the form of amino acids we observe in biology now,' said Irene Chen, of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Samueli School of Engineering, corresponding author of the Nature Communications paper. In the experiment, the researchers simulated what could have been early-Earth conditions of the RNA world. They incubated a solution containing ribozymes and amino acid precursors to see the relative percentages of the right-handed and left-handed amino acid, phenylalanine, that it would help produce. They tested 15 different ribozyme combinations and found that ribozymes can favor either left-handed or right-handed amino acids. This suggested that RNA did not initially have a predisposed chemical bias for one form of amino acids. This lack of preference challenges the notion that early life was predisposed to select left-handed-amino acids, which dominate in modern proteins. 'The findings suggest that life’s eventual homochirality might not be a result of chemical determinism but could have emerged through later evolutionary pressures,' said co-author Alberto Vázquez-Salazar, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar and member of Chen’s research group. Earth’s prebiotic history lies beyond the oldest part of the fossil record, which has been erased by plate tectonics, the slow churning of Earth’s crust. During that time, the planet was likely bombarded by asteroids, which may have delivered some of life’s building blocks, such as amino acids. In parallel to chemical experiments, other origin-of-life researchers have been looking at molecular evidence from meteorites and asteroids. 'Understanding the chemical properties of life helps us know what to look for in our search for life across the solar system,' said co-author Jason Dworkin, senior scientist for astrobiology at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and director of Goddard’s Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory. Dworkin is the project scientist on NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which extracted samples from the asteroid Bennu and delivered them to Earth last year for further study. 'We are analyzing OSIRIS-REx samples for the chirality (handedness) of individual amino acids, and in the future, samples from Mars will also be tested in laboratories for evidence of life including ribozymes and proteins,' said Dworkin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lTFYJ05qC5UZ	2024-11-21T15:20:08-08:00	
What Are The Effects Of Historic Lithium Mining On Water Quality?	Lithium ore and mining waste from a historic lithium mine located west of Charlotte, North Carolina, are unlikely to contaminate surrounding waters with common pollutants such as arsenic and lead, according to a new study. However, high levels of other metals — namely, lithium, rubidium and cesium — do occur in waters associated with the mine. The new findings, from Avner Vengosh, distinguished professor of environmental quality at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, shed light on potential water quality impacts of legacy, or historic, lithium mining. They also provide baseline data for future studies exploring how reopening lithium mines in the N.C. piedmont will likely affect the water quality of drinking water resources nearby. 'The world is increasingly relying on lithium for the green-energy transition, but previous studies on the environmental effects of hard-rock lithium mining show mixed results,' Vengosh said. 'This study provides new, important data to clarify the possible environmental impacts. The area where the Kings Mountain Mine is located was once the largest lithium-producing region in the world. Situated in wooded, rural terrain of the piedmont, the mine opened in the 1950s and was abandoned in the 1980s, when more accessible lithium deposits drew prospectors to South America. The lithium at Kings Mountain primarily exists in granite-like rock called pegmatite, bound to a green-tinged mineral called spodumene. For their study, the researchers collected samples of pegmatite and waste rocks from in and around the mine, as well as samples of tailings — crushed rocks left over from historic spodumene extraction. They also sampled groundwater from the mine and surface water from Kings Creek, which flows from the mine. Samples from various piedmont streams provided baseline data on water quality. The researchers pulverized rock samples and mixed them in a solution designed to test how various contaminants might enter the surrounding environment. These laboratory experiments simulate how contaminants in the rocks would leach out under natural conditions. The researchers then analyzed the solutions, as well as the surface water and groundwater samples, for a wide range of metals commonly used to evaluate water quality. The study was published online in the journal Science of the Total Environment. Leaching experiments and water samples analyzed in the study showed common regulated contaminants — including arsenic, lead, copper and nickel — at levels below drinking water and ecological standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 'The fact that we don’t see these toxic contaminants was, in some way, a relief, because it suggests that future lithium exploration in North Carolina would not cause major negative water quality effects with respect to these elements,' Vengosh said. However, the team found high levels of other metals in the mine site relative to their concentrations in the piedmont water resources. 'We detected elevated concentrations of lithium, which was expected, but also found rubidium and cesium at levels you normally don’t see in natural waters, and that are not federally regulated,' said first author Gordon Williams, a Ph.D. student in Vengosh’s lab and the Division of Earth and Climate Sciences. 'An outstanding question, then, is how these elements affect human and environmental health.' Leaching experiments and evidence from water samples also indicated that the legacy lithium mine does not contribute to environmentally harmful acidic runoff commonly associated with other mining operations, like coal mining. Rather, interactions between the ore and waste rock samples and water led to temporary alkaline, or basic, conditions. The study did not address the effects of active lithium mining and processing on water quality, the authors emphasized. 'Excavating and crushing ore is just one aspect of lithium mining. Processing — which requires a chemical treatment to separate lithium from spodumene — may include additional chemicals that could potentially affect water quality,' Williams said. 'When lithium mining ramps up again in this area, processing could have impacts on local water resources that we didn’t measure,' he cautioned. The researchers are now extending their study by assessing drinking water quality across a band of lithium-rich geological terrain in the piedmont. By sampling private wells and surface water, they can better understand the potential impacts of lithium mining on water quality in North Carolina. The study was funded by the Duke University Climate Research Innovation Seed Program (CRISP) and the Albemarle Corporation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lUNufprwgocM	2024-11-21T15:18:04-08:00	
Fewer Than 7% Of Global Hotspots For Whale-Ship Collisions Have P...	According to the fossil record, cetaceans — whales, dolphins and their relatives — evolved from four-legged land mammals that returned to the oceans beginning some 50 million years ago. Today, their descendants are threatened by a different land-based mammal that has also returned to the sea: humans. Thousands of whales are injured or killed each year after being struck by ships, particularly the large container vessels that ferry 80% of the world’s traded goods across the oceans. Collisions are the leading cause of death worldwide for large whale species. Yet global data on ship strikes of whales are hard to come by — impeding efforts to protect vulnerable whale species. A new study led by the University of Washington has for the first time quantified the risk for whale-ship collisions worldwide for four geographically widespread ocean giants that are threatened by shipping: blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales. In the paper, published online in Science, researchers report that global shipping traffic overlaps with about 92% of these whale species’ ranges. 'This translates to ships traveling thousands of times the distance to the moon and back within these species’ ranges each and every year, and this problem is only projected to increase as global trade grows in the coming decades,' said senior author Briana Abrahms, a UW assistant professor of biology and researcher with the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Whale-ship collisions have typically only been studied at a local or regional level — like off the east and west coasts of the continental U.S., and patterns of risk remain unknown for large areas,' said lead author Anna Nisi, a UW postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Our study is an attempt to fill those knowledge gaps and understand the risk of ship strikes on a global level. It’s important to understand where these collisions are likely to occur because there are some really simple interventions that can substantially reduce collision risk.' The team found that only about 7% of areas at highest risk for whale-ship collisions have any measures in place to protect whales from this threat. These measures include speed reductions, both mandatory and voluntary, for ships crossing waters that overlap with whale migration or feeding areas. 'As much as we found cause for concern, we also found some big silver linings,' said Abrahms. 'For example, implementing management measures across only an additional 2.6% of the ocean’s surface would protect all of the highest-risk collision hotspots we identified.' 'Trade-offs between industrial and conservation outcomes are not usually this optimal,' said co-author Heather Welch, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of California, Santa Cruz. 'Oftentimes industrial activities must be greatly limited to achieve conservation goals, or vice versa. In this case, there is a potentially large conservation benefit to whales for not much cost to the shipping industry.' Those highest-risk areas for the four while species included in the study lie largely along coastal areas in the Mediterranean, portions of the Americas, southern Africa and parts of Asia. The international team behind the study, which includes researchers across five continents, looked at the waters where these four whale species live, feed and migrate by pooling data from disparate sources — including government surveys, sightings by members of the public, tagging studies and even whaling records. The team collected some 435,000 unique whale sightings. They then combined this novel database with information on the courses of 176,000 cargo vessels from 2017 to 2022 — tracked by each ship’s automatic identification system and processed using an algorithm from Global Fishing Watch — to identify where whales and ships are most likely to meet. The study uncovered regions already known to be high-risk areas for ship strikes: North America’s Pacific coast, Panama, the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. But it also identified understudied regions at high risk for whale-ship collisions, including southern Africa; South America along the coasts of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Ecuador; the Azores; and East Asia off the coasts of China, Japan and South Korea. The team found that mandatory measures to reduce whale-ship collisions were very rare, overlapping just 0.54% of blue whale hotspots and 0.27% of humpback hotspots, and not overlapping any fin or sperm whale hotspots. Though many collision hotspots fell within marine protected areas, these preserves often lack speed limits for vessels, as they were largely established to curb fishing and industrial pollution. For all four species the vast majority of hotpots for whale-ship strikes — more than 95% — hugged coastlines, falling within a nation’s exclusive economic zone. That means that each country could implement its own protection measures in coordination with the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization. 'From the standpoint of conservation, the fact that most high-risk areas lie within exclusive economic zones is actually encouraging,' said Nisi. 'It means individual countries have the ability to protect the riskiest areas.' Of the limited measures now in place, most are along the Pacific coast of North America and in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to speed reduction, other options to reduce whale-ship strikes include changing vessel routings away from where whales are located, or creating alert systems to notify authorities and mariners when whales are nearby. 'Lowering vessel speed in hotspots also carries additional benefits, such as reducing underwater noise pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting air pollution, which helps people living in coastal areas,' said Nisi. The authors hope their global study could spur local or regional research to map out the hotspot zones in finer detail, inform advocacy efforts and consider the impact of climate change, which will change both whale and ship distributions as sea ice melts and ecosystems shift. 'Protecting whales from the impact of ship strikes is a huge global challenge. We’ve seen the benefits of slowing ships down at local scales through programs like ‘Blue Whales Blue Skies’ in California. Scaling up such programs will require a concerted effort by conservation organizations, governments and shipping companies,' said co-author Jono Wilson, director of ocean science at the California Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, which helped identify the need for this study and secured its funding. 'Whales play a critical role in marine ecosystems. Through this study we have measurable insights into ship-collision hotspots and risk and where we need to focus to make the most impact.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lQcUS7HS2lRa	2024-11-21T15:15:31-08:00	
Bye-Bye Microplastics: New Plastic Is Recyclable And Fully Ocean-...	Researchers led by Takuzo Aida at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) have developed a new durable plastic that won’t pollute our oceans. The new material is as strong as conventional plastics and biodegradable, but what makes it special is that it breaks down in seawater. The new plastic is therefore expected to help reduce harmful microplastic pollution that accumulates in oceans and soil and eventually enters the food chain. The experimental findings were published in Science. Scientists have been trying to develop safe and sustainable materials that can replace traditional plastics, which are non-sustainable and harm the environment. While some recyclable and biodegradable plastics exist, one big problem remains. Current biodegradable plastics like PLA often find their way into the ocean where they cannot be degraded because they are water insoluble. As a result, microplastics—plastic bits smaller than 5 mm—are harming aquatic life and finding their way into the food chain, including our own bodies. In their new study, Aida and his team focused on solving this problem with supramolecular plastics—polymers with structures held together by reversible interactions. The new plastics were made by combining two ionic monomers that form cross-linked salt bridges, which provide strength and flexibility. In the initial tests, one of the monomers was a common food additive called sodium hexametaphosphate and the other was any of several guanidinium ion-based monomers. Both monomers can be metabolized by bacteria, ensuring biodegradability once the plastic is dissolved into its components. 'While the reversable nature of the bonds in supramolecular plastics have been thought to make them weak and unstable,' says Aida, 'our new materials are just the opposite.' In the new material, the salt bridges structure is irreversible unless exposed to electrolytes like those found in seawater. The key discovery was how to create these selectively irreversible cross links. As with oil with water, after mixing the two monomers together in water, the researchers observed two separated liquids. One was thick and viscous and contained the important structural cross linked salt bridges, while the other was watery and contained salt ions. For example, when sodium hexametaphosphate and alkyl diguanidinium sulfate were used, sodium sulphate salt was expelled into the watery layer. The final plastic, alkyl SP₂, was made by drying what remained in the thick viscous liquid layer. The 'desalting' turned out to be the critical step; without it, the resulting dried material was a brittle crystal, unfit for use. Resalting the plastic by placing it in salt water caused the interactions to reverse and the plastic’s structure destabilized in a matter of hours. Thus, having created a strong and durable plastic that can still be dissolved under certain conditions, the researchers next tested the plastic’s quality. The new plastics are non-toxic and non-flammable—meaning no CO2 emissions—and can be reshaped at temperatures above 120°C like other thermoplastics. By testing different types of guanidinium sulfates, the team was able to generate plastics that had varying hardnesses and tensile strengths, all comparable or better than conventional plastics. This means that the new type of plastic can be customized for need; hard scratch resistant plastics, rubber silicone-like plastics, strong weight-bearing plastics, or low tensile flexible plastics are all possible. The researchers also created ocean-degradable plastics using polysaccharides that form cross-linked salt bridges with guanidinium monomers. Plastics like these can be used in 3D printing as well as medical or health-related applications. Lastly, the researchers investigated the new plastic’s recyclability and biodegradability. After dissolving the initial new plastic in salt water, they were able to recover 91% of the hexametaphosphate and 82% of the guanidinium as powders, indicating that recycling is easy and efficient. In soil, sheets of the new plastic degraded completely over the course of 10 days, supplying the soil with phosphorous and nitrogen similar to a fertilizer. 'With this new material, we have created a new family of plastics that are strong, stable, recyclable, can serve multiple functions, and importantly, do not generate microplastics,' says Aida.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MmdfIEfsRign	2024-11-21T15:13:35-08:00	
Quantum-Inspired Design Boosts Efficiency Of Heat-To-Electricity ...	Researchers at Rice University have found a new way to improve a key element of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems, which convert heat into electricity via light. Using an unconventional approach inspired by quantum physics, Rice engineer Gururaj Naik and his team designed a thermal emitter that can deliver high efficiencies within practical design parameters.The research could inform the development of thermal-energy electrical storage, which holds promise as an affordable, grid-scale alternative to batteries. More broadly, efficient TPV technologies could facilitate renewable energy growth ⎯ an essential component of the transition to a net-zero world. Another major benefit of better TPV systems is recouping waste heat from industrial processes, making them more sustainable. To put this in context, up to 20-50% of the heat used to transform raw materials into consumer goods ends up being wasted, costing the United States economy over $200 billion annually.TPV systems involve two main components ⎯ photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert light into electricity and thermal emitters that turn heat into light. Both of these components have to work well in order for the system to be efficient, but efforts to optimize them have focused more on the PV cell. 'Using conventional design approaches limits thermal emitters’ design space, and what you end up with is one of two scenarios: practical, low-performance devices or high-performance emitters that are hard to integrate in real-world applications,' said Naik, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. In a new study published in npj Nanophotonics, Naik and his former Ph.D. student Ciril Samuel Prasad ⎯ who has since earned a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering from Rice and has taken on a role as a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ⎯ demonstrated a new thermal emitter that promises efficiencies of over 60% despite being application-ready. 'We essentially showed how to achieve the best possible performance for the emitter given realistic, practical design constraints,' said Prasad, who is the first author on the study.The emitter is composed of a tungsten metal sheet, a thin layer of a spacer material and a network of silicon nanocylinders. When heated, the base layers accumulate thermal radiation, which can be thought of as a bath of photons. The tiny resonators sitting on top 'talk' to each other in a way that allows them to 'pluck photon by photon' from this bath, controlling the brightness and bandwidth of the light sent to the PV cell.'Instead of focusing on the performance of single-resonator systems, we instead took into account the way these resonators interact, which opened up new possibilities,' Naik explained. 'This gave us control over how the photons are stored and released.' This selective emission, achieved through insights from quantum physics, maximizes energy conversion and allows for higher efficiencies than previously possible, operating at the limit of the materials’ properties. To improve on the newly achieved 60% efficiency, new materials with better properties would need to be developed or discovered.These gains could make TPV a competitive alternative to other energy storage and conversion technologies like lithium-ion batteries, particularly in scenarios where long-term energy storage is needed. Naik noted that this innovation has significant implications for industries that generate large amounts of waste heat such as nuclear power plants and manufacturing facilities.'I feel confident that what we have demonstrated here, coupled with a very efficient low bandgap PV cell, has very promising potential,' Naik said. 'Based on my own experience working with NASA and launching a startup in the renewable energy space, I think that energy conversion technologies are very much in need today.'The team’s technology could also be used in space applications such as powering rovers on Mars.'If our approach could lead to an increase in efficiency from 2% to 5% in such systems, that would represent a significant boost for missions that rely on efficient power generation in extreme environments,' Naik said.The research was supported by the National Science Foundation (1935446) and the U.S. Army Research Office.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MuroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-21T15:11:27-08:00	
Exploring The Impact Of Offshore Wind On Whale Deaths	In the winter of 2022-2023, nearly a dozen whales died off the coast of New Jersey, near the sites of several proposed wind farms. Their deaths prompted concern that related survey work being conducted in the area somehow contributed to their deaths. In pursuit of clean energy goals and to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions, developers are increasingly exploring building wind turbines in the waters off the East Coast of the United States. Three offshore wind farms are already in operation, with several more planned or underway. These wind farms stand to generate a significant amount of carbon-free electricity, which can help coastal states meet their decarbonization goals. The increased presence of these turbines in coastal waters, along with the noise from construction and surveys, has led to concerns of their impact on marine life. In particular, cetaceans such as whales and dolphins are likely to be sensitive to the noises and increased marine traffic brought by these turbines. However, the Marine Mammal Commission, a federal oversight agency, states there is no evidence linking the whales that died in the New Jersey region in the winter of 2022-2023 to wind energy development. According to necropsies performed on recovered whales, many of them died from collisions with ships. The Marine Mammal Commission notes that this is not a particularly unusual occurrence, nor is the number of whale deaths in this period higher than average. A rise in ship strikes over the last decade is mostly due to a simple combination of more whales plus more ships. 'In the case of a lot of whales, population recoveries since the cessation of commercial whaling are coincident with increasing shipping traffic and increasing fishing efforts,' said Stocker. 'This is resulting in increased interactions between whales and the industrialization of the ocean.' Stocker, however, is concerned that the increased presence of survey ships in and around New Jersey waters may have exacerbated this issue. 'Were the ship strikes just a coincidence?' asked Stocker. 'Or were they a product of compromised whale vigilance due to aggregated stress factors?' Survey ships are employed by wind farm developers to map the seafloor in preparation for construction. These ships use underwater acoustic devices in their efforts, which can stress marine mammals such as whales. While one survey ship likely has little effect, Stocker highlights that 11 different surveys were operating in the region from December 2022 to March 2023, and that the cumulative impact of these surveys has not been properly evaluated. Stocker hopes his session will spark a discussion among attendees with the goal of identifying approaches to minimize whale deaths in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeEK_t_OqF2dsQ36glFESvq	2024-11-21T15:09:31-08:00	
Astronomers Take The First Close-Up Picture Of A Star Outside Our...	For the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star in a galaxy outside our own Milky Way,' says Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist from Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile. Located a staggering 160 000 light-years from us, the star WOH G64 was imaged thanks to the impressive sharpness offered by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope Interferometer (ESO’s VLTI). The new observations reveal a star puffing out gas and dust, in the last stages before it becomes a supernova. 'We discovered an egg-shaped cocoon closely surrounding the star,' says Ohnaka, the lead author of a study reporting the observations published today in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 'We are excited because this may be related to the drastic ejection of material from the dying star before a supernova explosion.' While astronomers have taken about two dozen zoomed-in images of stars in our galaxy, unveiling their properties, countless other stars dwell within other galaxies, so far away that observing even one of them in detail has been extremely challenging. Up until now. The newly imaged star, WOH G64, lies within the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the small galaxies that orbits the Milky Way. Astronomers have known about this star for decades and have appropriately dubbed it the ‘behemoth star’. With a size roughly 2000 times that of our Sun, WOH G64 is classified as a red supergiant. Ohnaka’s team had long been interested in this behemoth star. Back in 2005 and 2007, they used ESO’s VLTI in Chile’s Atacama Desert to learn more about the star’s features, and carried on studying it in the years since. But an actual image of the star had remained elusive. For the desired picture, the team had to wait for the development of one of the VLTI’s second-generation instruments, GRAVITY. After comparing their new results with other previous observations of WOH G64, they were surprised to find that the star had become dimmer over the past decade. 'We have found that the star has been experiencing a significant change in the last 10 years, providing us with a rare opportunity to witness a star’s life in real time,' says Gerd Weigelt, an astronomy professor at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany and a co-author of the study. In their final life stages, red supergiants like WOH G64 shed their outer layers of gas and dust in a process that can last thousands of years. 'This star is one of the most extreme of its kind, and any drastic change may bring it closer to an explosive end,' adds co-author Jacco van Loon, Keele Observatory Director at Keele University, UK, who has been observing WOH G64 since the 1990s. The team thinks that these shed materials may also be responsible for the dimming and for the unexpected shape of the dust cocoon around the star. The new image shows that the cocoon is stretched-out, which surprised scientists, who expected a different shape based on previous observations and computer models. The team believes that the cocoon’s egg-like shape could be explained by either the star’s shedding or by the influence of a yet-undiscovered companion star. As the star becomes fainter, taking other close-up pictures of it is becoming increasingly difficult, even for the VLTI. Nonetheless, planned updates to the telescope’s instrumentation, such as the future GRAVITY+, promise to change this soon. 'Similar follow-up observations with ESO instruments will be important for understanding what is going on in the star,' concludes Ohnaka.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXKJpqYMBg15l	2024-11-21T15:07:18-08:00	
Research Highlights The Pressures Human Activities Place On Tropi...	The tropical coastlines of Southeast Asia are home to some of the most important and biodiverse marine ecosystems on the planet. However, they are also among its most vulnerable, with areas of coral reefs, mangrove forests and seagrass beds under increasing threat from a wide range of human activities. To try and better understand those potential threats, a study by an international team of researchers has provided the first detailed assessment of activities taking place within coastal and marine habitats and the impact they have on those ecosystems. The research focused on case study sites in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, including marine protected areas in UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Reserves as well as a Marine Park. Of the 26 activities that were examined, it found that particular fishing techniques – and tourism and recreation – posed the greatest threat to the ecosystems. The fishing practices, including trawling and the use of gill and seine nets, were shown to cause physical pressures such as abrasion, smothering, siltation and total habitat loss. Meanwhile tourism activities resulted in different pressures such as organic enrichment, litter and pollution, in particular affecting coral reef habitats. With fishing and tourism being critical to the region’s economy, the researchers hope that highlighting their potential to impact specific locations could help ensure they can be conducted in a more sustainable manner in the future. The study, published in the British Ecological Society’s Journal of Applied Ecology, was led by researchers from the University of Plymouth together and involved colleagues from across Southeast Asia. It was carried out as part of Blue Communities, a £6.7million programme funded through the UK Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) in partnership with UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Dr Fiona Culhane, who carried out the research as part of a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Plymouth, and is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Marine Institute in Ireland, is the study’s lead author. She said: 'These sites are globally significant for their high marine biodiversity, but are at high risk of pressures from human activities. This work, carried out in collaboration with local communities and in-country researchers, has demonstrated that different locations experience different risks, according to the level of human activities in the sea. By better understanding how human activities are impacting various marine habitats, and the ecosystem services they provide, we can provide local stakeholders and marine managers with clearer evidence that they can use to inform future action.' Professor Melanie Austen, Professor of Ocean and Society at the University of Plymouth and lead of the Blue Communities programme, added: 'This study is a powerful example of strong collaboration between researchers from the Global South and Global North. Its aim, and that of the entire programme, has been to provide much needed analysis and information to help coastal communities live within the environmental limits of the natural marine resources.' In addition to forms of fishing and tourism, the research explored the importance and impact of activities including waste disposal, sand mining, aquaculture, coastal infrastructure development, and antique exploration. It then mapped whether, and to what extent, each activity caused forms of disruption including light, noise and water pollution, as well as physical damage to the coastline and seabed and the habitats they contained. Across the different countries, there was variation in the activities posing the greatest pressures with, for example, high risk coming from seine nets in Vietnam, fish farming in Malaysia and pots, traps and barricades in the Philippines. There were also differences across the main habitat types, with trawling and blast finishing among the activities posing the greatest risk to coral reefs, while shrimp farming placed the greatest pressure on mangroves, and trawling and tourism introduced the highest risk to seagrass. Dr Amy Y. Then, Associate Professor in the Institute of Biological Sciences at the Universiti Malaya in Malaysia, said: 'Findings from this paper challenge the way we think about spatially managing multiple economic activities and their impacts on vital coastal ecosystems. By identifying interactions between these activities and the habitats where they take place, we are able to make better marine spatial management decisions to ensure sustainability and resilience of these socio-ecological systems and their functioning.' Dr Radisti Praptiwi, researcher at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia, added 'This is an important study, especially in the context of data poor regions such as Indonesia. Research on understanding the impact chains linking activities and pressures to the marine environment can not only help identify the types of activities and habitats to be prioritised for management purposes, but also highlights areas for further research required for evidence-based policymaking.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXLwW2N6rpCd5	2024-11-21T15:04:50-08:00	
North Korea’s Troop Deployment To Russia: A Threat To Global Secu...	The deployment of 10,000 North Korean troops to support Russia in its conflict with Ukraine poses significant threats to international security and geopolitical stability. This manoeuvre not only escalates the ongoing conflict but also further aligns authoritarian states against democratic nations, thereby challenging established international norms and the fragile global balance of power. Immediate and coordinated action from the international community is essential to avert catastrophic consequences. North Korea's involvement would intensify hostilities, embolden other authoritarian regimes to act with impunity, and potentially incite widespread instability throughout Eastern Europe and beyond. This analysis posits that such an intervention constitutes a profound threat to international security and order, necessitating urgent diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and mitigate the risks of escalation. North Korea's potential troop deployment is particularly concerning because it would directly violate United Nations sanctions aimed at curbing Pyongyang's militaristic ambitions and destabilising activities. This action would undermine the credibility of the United Nations and challenge the broader framework of international law that prohibits the external militarisation of conflicts. Furthermore, it would legitimise the use of proxy forces by authoritarian regimes to influence regional conflicts, thereby undermining the principle of state sovereignty.Russia's acceptance of North Korean troops reflects its desperation to bolster its military efforts amid increasing resistance from Ukrainian forces supported by Western allies. The involvement of North Korean troops could significantly alter the dynamics of the conflict, compelling Ukraine to adapt to a more formidable military challenge while complicating logistical and strategic considerations for its Western supporters.North Korea's motivations for this deployment appear rooted in strategic calculations. First, the North seeks to reinforce its alliance with Russia, a critical supporter during its period of international isolation and economic sanctions. In return, Russia may offer North Korea advanced weapons technology, energy resources, or diplomatic protection at the United Nations, thereby strengthening a burgeoning alliance of authoritarian states opposing Western dominance. Second, North Korea likely views this as an opportunity to showcase its military capabilities and attain a more influential position in global geopolitics. By actively participating in a significant international conflict, Pyongyang may aim to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States and other powers concerning its nuclear programme and the sanctions imposed on it. Third, North Korea may perceive this engagement as a chance to evaluate its military in real combat scenarios, potentially bolstering its domestic image among its populace and military elites. The implications of such a deployment extend significantly beyond the battlefield. Regionally, it would heighten tensions in East Asia, where nations such as South Korea and Japan are already apprehensive regarding North Korea's aggressive posture and military threats. The potential involvement of North Korean troops in Ukraine might prompt these countries to enhance their military preparedness, potentially triggering an arms race in the region. Additionally, China, North Korea’s traditional ally, would encounter a complex dilemma. While Beijing may prefer a stronger Russia to counterbalance U.S. influence, it could also express concern regarding the destabilising effects of Pyongyang’s actions and the risk of increasing international scrutiny on its role in global geopolitics. Globally, North Korea’s intervention would establish a precedent that emboldens other states to disregard international norms. Authoritarian regimes may feel more empowered to engage in military actions, whether to support allied governments or suppress opposition movements abroad. This erosion of international law could usher in an era of heightened conflict and instability, undermining decades of efforts to establish a rules-based global order. For Western powers, North Korea’s involvement creates a strategic dilemma, compelling nations such as the United States, the European Union, and NATO to determine the extent to which they are willing to counter not only Russia but also its external supporters. A miscalculation in this context could escalate the conflict into a broader war involving multiple major powers. To address this crisis, the international community must take prompt steps to prevent North Korea from deploying troops and to mitigate broader escalation risks. Diplomacy should serve as the primary tool. Direct engagement with North Korea may prove challenging; however, neutral countries could act as intermediaries to convey the consequences of such a move. Offering Pyongyang economic incentives or security assurances in exchange for refraining from intervention might represent a viable pathway. Concurrently, the United Nations must reassert its authority by convening an emergency session to address potential sanctions violations and to issue a strong condemnation against any external military involvement in the Ukraine conflict.Furthermore, the West should enhance its support for Ukraine by increasing the supply of advanced weaponry and intelligence to equip Kyiv to counter any escalation. Simultaneously, efforts should be directed toward economically and diplomatically pressuring Russia. Strengthening sanctions on Russian entities and individuals involved in facilitating troop deployments, combined with intensified efforts to isolate Moscow on the global stage, could deter further reliance on foreign military support. Establishing multilateral dialogue platforms involving nations from East Asia and Europe could also facilitate addressing the broader implications of North Korea’s actions and create mechanisms for de-escalation. In conclusion, the potential deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia in Ukraine signifies a critical juncture in global politics, carrying extensive implications for international security and order. This situation underscores the increasing alignment of authoritarian regimes that are prepared to challenge established norms through overt militarism. The international community must respond with decisiveness to mitigate this development, employing a strategic blend of diplomatic engagement, economic pressure, and military preparedness. While the immediate focus should be on deterring North Korea’s involvement, long-term strategies must prioritise the reinforcement of international law principles and the promotion of cooperation to address the root causes of such conflicts. A unified multilateral approach is imperative to maintain global stability and uphold the values of peace and sovereignty that underpin the international system.

The Puzzle Of Meaning: Wittgenstein’s Revolution And His Philosop...	Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) is regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. His groundbreaking works, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) and Philosophical Investigations (1953), laid the foundation for two distinct phases of his thought—commonly referred to as the 'early Wittgenstein' and the 'later Wittgenstein.' His ideas profoundly shaped several domains of philosophy, including logic, language, epistemology, and metaphysics, influencing a wide range of philosophers and intellectual movements. This article explores Wittgenstein's core ideas and his impact on philosophy, shedding light on the intellectuals and movements he influenced. The Core Ideas of Wittgenstein 1. The Early Wittgenstein: Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Wittgenstein's Tractatus addresses the relationship between language, thought, and reality. It is built on the premise that the world is composed of facts, not objects, and that language represents these facts through logical propositions. Key Ideas Picture Theory of Language Wittgenstein argues that language functions as a 'picture' of reality. A proposition mirrors a possible state of affairs, meaning that language and the world share a logical structure. For instance, the sentence 'The cat is on the mat' corresponds to the fact that a cat is indeed on the mat. Logical Atomism Influenced by Bertrand Russell, Wittgenstein proposed that the world consists of atomic facts—basic, indivisible components—and language's purpose is to map these facts. Limits of Language Wittgenstein famously concluded the Tractatus with the aphorism: 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.' He suggests that metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic questions lie beyond the bounds of meaningful language. This work influenced the Vienna Circle and the logical positivists, who sought to ground philosophy in logical analysis and empirical verification. 2. The Later Wittgenstein: Philosophical Investigations In his later work, Wittgenstein shifted focus, critiquing his earlier views and emphasizing the social and practical aspects of language. Key Ideas Language Games Wittgenstein argued that the meaning of words arises from their use in various 'language games'—contexts of activity governed by rules. Language is not a fixed system but a fluid, social phenomenon where meaning depends on context. Rule-Following and Practices He explored how individuals understand and follow rules, emphasizing shared practices rather than abstract logic as the foundation of communication. Family Resemblance Instead of fixed definitions, Wittgenstein introduced the idea that concepts often share overlapping similarities, like members of a family, without having a single, unifying essence. Critique of Private Language Wittgenstein rejected the idea of a purely private language, arguing that language inherently requires public criteria for meaning. This phase of Wittgenstein's thought influenced ordinary language philosophy and broader philosophical debates on meaning and understanding. Philosophers Influenced by Wittgenstein 1. Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) Although Russell influenced Wittgenstein during the latter's early years, Wittgenstein's Tractatus left a deep impression on Russell. He adopted and later critiqued Wittgenstein's logical atomism in his own works. Russell struggled with Wittgenstein's assertion that certain topics, such as ethics, are inexpressible. 2. The Vienna Circle Wittgenstein's early ideas strongly influenced the Vienna Circle, a group of logical positivists including Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath. They embraced his notion of the limits of language and sought to construct a philosophy based on scientific principles. Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) Carnap applied Wittgenstein's ideas to his project of logical syntax, although he diverged on metaphysical issues, adopting a more empiricist stance. 3. Gilbert Ryle (1900–1976) Ryle, a prominent figure in ordinary language philosophy, engaged with Wittgenstein's later works. His Concept of Mind reflected Wittgenstein's critique of dualism and the private language argument. 4. J.L. Austin (1911–1960) Austin's speech act theory owes much to Wittgenstein's focus on the practical use of language. Austin examined how utterances perform actions, aligning with Wittgenstein's emphasis on language games. 5. Peter Strawson (1919–2006) Strawson's descriptive metaphysics was influenced by Wittgenstein's later philosophy, particularly the emphasis on ordinary language as a guide to philosophical inquiry. 6. Saul Kripke (1940–2022) Kripke's Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language is one of the most significant interpretations of Wittgenstein's later work. Kripke presented a skeptical reading, questioning how rules are followed and understood, sparking debates in epistemology and the philosophy of language. 7. Elizabeth Anscombe (1919–2001) A student of Wittgenstein, Anscombe translated the Tractatus into English and engaged deeply with his ideas. Her works on intention and ethics reflect Wittgensteinian insights into human action and meaning. 8. Norman Malcolm (1911–1990) Malcolm, another student of Wittgenstein, contributed to the understanding of the later Wittgenstein, particularly his views on memory and the mind. 9. Stanley Cavell (1926–2018) Cavell explored Wittgenstein's later philosophy in relation to skepticism and ordinary language. His works, such as The Claim of Reason, extended Wittgensteinian ideas into aesthetics and ethics. 10. John Searle (1932–2022) Searle's philosophy of language and mind, particularly his theory of speech acts, draws on Wittgenstein's analysis of language use. 11. Richard Rorty (1931–2007) Rorty integrated Wittgenstein's later philosophy into his critique of traditional epistemology, advocating for a pragmatic approach that aligns with Wittgenstein's anti-essentialism. 12. Michel Foucault (1926–1984) Although not directly linked, Foucault's concept of discourse reflects Wittgenstein's emphasis on the social and contextual dimensions of language. 13. Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) Derrida's deconstruction shares affinities with Wittgenstein's later philosophy, particularly the focus on meaning as contextual and contingent. 14. Hilary Putnam (1926–2016) Putnam engaged with Wittgenstein's ideas in his critique of metaphysical realism and his exploration of the philosophy of mind and language. 15. D.Z. Phillips (1934–2006) Phillips applied Wittgenstein's ideas to philosophy of religion, rejecting metaphysical approaches and focusing on the use of religious language. Movements Influenced by Wittgenstein 1. Logical Positivism Wittgenstein's early work shaped the agenda of logical positivism, although he later distanced himself from their strict empiricism. 2. Ordinary Language Philosophy The later Wittgenstein inspired philosophers like Austin and Ryle, emphasizing the analysis of everyday language. 3. Postmodernism Wittgenstein's critique of grand theories and focus on contextual meaning resonated with postmodernist thinkers. 4. Philosophy of Mind His ideas on rule-following, private language, and mental states influenced debates in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Critiques and Counterpoints While Wittgenstein's ideas were transformative, they also faced criticism. Karl Popper critiqued Wittgenstein's view of philosophy as merely descriptive, arguing for a more critical and problem-solving approach. Noam Chomsky rejected Wittgenstein's emphasis on language games, advocating for a universal grammar rooted in cognitive structures. Conclusion Ludwig Wittgenstein's legacy lies in his dual contributions to philosophy- the logical precision of the Tractatus and the dynamic, contextual approach of the Philosophical Investigations. His influence extends across multiple fields, from analytic philosophy to postmodernism, and his ideas continue to inspire and challenge philosophers. By reimagining the boundaries of language and thought, Wittgenstein reshaped the philosophical landscape, leaving an enduring mark on intellectual history.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdxpqeWb-tgG3YrJqnlYH9	2024-11-21T09:28:18-08:00	
Ukraine Accuses Russia Of Firing Intercontinental Ballistic Missi...	(RFE/RL) -- Russia launched a massive missile attack early on November 21 on Ukraine that caused damage in at least two regions, Ukraine's air force and regional leaders reported, as the whole country was under an air-raid alert for several hours. The Russian attack, which Kyiv said included the use of an intercontinental ballistic missile, comes just days after reports that Ukraine used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS systems to strike military targets deeper inside Russia following the long-sought approval by President Joe Biden. 'On the morning of November 21, 2024...Russian troops attacked the city of Dnipro (facilities and critical infrastructure) with missiles of various types. In particular, an intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation,' the Ukrainian Air Force said in its statement on Telegram. The Kremlin has refused to comment on the alleged firing of the ICBM, which, if proved, would be the first use of such a weapon in war. ICBMs are designed to deliver long-distance nuclear strikes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram, 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is. And how afraid he is.' 'All characteristics -- speed, altitude -- [point to an] intercontinental ballistic missile,' Zelenskiy said. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry walked back the air force's definitive statement, saying Kyiv is still determining what type of missile struck in Dnipro. 'If it is confirmed that specifically an intercontinental ballistic missile was used, then we believe it can be said that Putin's Russia has degraded to the status of North Korea,' ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said. Military analysts, however, were cautious about labeling the missile as an ICBM, noting such missiles can also be classified as intermediate-range missiles when their payloads are increased and ranges decreased. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said that, if confirmed, the use of an ICBM would be 'extremely serious.' The Pentagon did not immediately return a request for comment. The main target of the Russian attack was the southeastern region of Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine's most important industrial region, and its capital, the city of Dnipro. Ukraine's air force said that besides the ICBM, Russian aircraft also launched a hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile and seven subsonic Kh-101 cruise missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six Kh-101 missiles, the air force reported. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said his region bore the brunt of the Russian attack. 'Since early in the morning, the aggressor massively attacked our region,' Lysak reported on Telegram, adding that preliminary information showed that an industrial facility was damaged in the regional capital, Dnipro, where two fires were started by the attack. Explosions were also reported in Kremenchuk, in the central Poltava region. Moscow's use of a large number of sophisticated missiles as opposed to the usual drone attacks appears to be in response to Ukraine's gaining approval to use some Western-donated long-range missile systems to strike deeper into Russia. On November 20, Russian military bloggers and a source cited by Reuters reported that Ukraine had fired up to 12 Franco-British Storm Shadow missiles into Russia's Kursk region, part of which has been under Ukrainian control following a surprise incursion by Ukrainian troops in August. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to confirm whether the missiles had been used. Previously, London had given permission to use the Storm Shadows, which have a 250-kilometer range, within Ukraine's territory. Earlier this week, Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS to strike a military facility in Russia's Bryansk region after Biden was reported as giving his OK. The White House has not officially confirmed the approval and Ukraine hasn't directly acknowledged the use of ATACMS on Russian targets. Russia has long warned that Ukraine's use Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside its territory would mark a serious escalation of the conflict. On November 21, Moscow said a new U.S. missile defence base in the Polish town of Redzikowo near the Baltic coast, which was opened on November 13 as part of a broader NATO missile shield, will lead to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger. 'This is another frankly provocative step in a series of deeply destabilising actions by the Americans and their allies in the North Atlantic alliance in the strategic sphere,' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. 'This leads to undermining strategic stability, increasing strategic risks and, as a result, to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger,' Zakharova said. Poland rejected the claim, saying there were no nuclear missiles at the base. 'It is a base that serves the purpose of defense, not attack,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said on November 21.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdxpqeWb-tgHAEKF7rf7CP	2024-11-21T09:26:49-08:00	
The Mainstream Media’s Big Lie Never Stops – OpEd	Eduardo Porter joined the chorus of people telling us that the inequality of the last four decades was just the result of the free market in his Washington Post column. As Porter puts it: 'A paper last year by economists from Princeton and Columbia argues that Democrats started losing the working class back in the 1970s, when they bought into the notion that the government should let market forces rip, dropping the New Deal approach of improving workers’ lot via strong unions, job guarantees, minimum wages and protectionism — and instead assisting the economy’s losers via taxes and transfers.' He then argues that this is the source of the rise in working class support for authoritarianism. The problem with this line is that we did not let market forces rip. Government-granted patent and copyright monopolies are not the market. They are hugely important in the economy, likely shifting more than $1 trillion a year ($8,000 a family) from the rest of us to those in a position to benefit from these monopoles. Higher drug prices are the most visible transfer, but these monopolies also add hugely to the price of a wide range of other items like computers, software, smartphones. Then we also have government support for the financial industry. This was most visible during the financial crisis when the government directly saved many of the largest financial corporations in the country from bankruptcy. There are many other supports for the financial industry, such as deposit insurance, which are less visible. This sector is the source of many of the largest fortunes in the economy. We also have rules of corporate governance that allow CEOs and other top executives to rip off the companies they work for. This allows hugely bloated pay at the top which comes at the expense of ordinary workers. These rules are not 'letting the market rip.' They are written by politicians who get campaign contributions from top executives. Also 'free trade' has never meant free trade in highly paid professions like physicians’ and dentists’ services. If these highly paid professionals were subject to the same sort of competition as autoworkers and textiles workers their pay would be considerably lower, and healthcare would be cheaper for the rest of us. I go into these issues in more detail in my book Rigged (it’s free), but the basic point should be clear. There is a widely repeated lie that inequality was driven by the natural workings of the market. The reality is that politicians of both parties worked to structure the market to bring about more unequal outcomes. The media and most of the academic establishment actively push this lie at every opportunity. And people are pissed. To be clear, I’m sure that almost none of them know anything about patent policy or the rules of corporate governance. They just know that the rules are structured against them, and they are absolutely right. And elite outlets like the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Atlantic won’t let anyone make this obvious point in the spaces they control.

The World Monetary Order: From Currency Globalization To Currency...	The world economic order began to undergo a profound shift after Russia launched its war against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and the West imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response. Not only is the architecture of the global economy changing, but also the global monetary system. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the US-led unipolar world order was fueling the process of hyper-globalization. For its part, hyper-globalization has largely contributed to the maintenance of that unipolar world order, which primarily stems from the interconnectedness of globalization and world order. The unipolar world order and hyper-globalization played a central role in determining the global monetary system, with the US dollar commanding leadership in world trade as the primary reserve currency. By 2000, over 70% of all foreign-exchange reserves were held in US dollars, and its dominance in international trade led exporters and importers to increasingly rely on dollar-denominated borrowing. Based on this, the US dollar, as the world’s main reserve currency, was employed to advance US interests. Hyper-globalization, in turn, strengthened the position of the US dollar in the global economy. In this context, the clear dominance of the US dollar in both international trade and global foreign-exchange reserves can be characterized as currency globalization. The economic sanctions imposed by the West on Russia have affected the global dominance of the US dollar. At the start of the war in Ukraine, one-fifth of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves were in dollar assets, much of which were in Germany, France, Britain and Japan, which, along with other Western countries, are now working together to isolate Moscow from the global financial system. In the context of the US dollar’s weakening position as the dominant global currency, the West’s seizure of nearly $300 billion in frozen Russian assets held by the US and its allies, and the use of the proceeds to defend and rebuild Ukraine, has taken on particular significance. It is important to acknowledge that over the past half-century, the dominance of the US dollar has experienced fluctuations. For instance, while the dollar’s share of world currency reserves was 80% in 1970, by 1980 it had dropped to 58%, and by 1990 to 47%. However, by 2000, it had rebounded to 70%. Since then, the share of the US dollar in world currency reserves has declined again, by 2020 reaching 59%. Notably, this decline was not accompanied by significant gains for traditional reserve currencies like the euro, yen and pound sterling. Instead, the shift has been towards non-traditional reserve currencies, such as the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, South Korean won, Singapore dollar and the currencies of the Nordic countries. With the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the process of globalization entered the stage of confrontational globalization, seeing the countries of the world divided into three groups: those supporting Western sanctions, those supporting Russia, and neutral countries. As a result, the unipolar world order began to transform into a multipolar world order. This could not help but influence the world monetary order that developed under hyper-globalization, when the geopolitical factor stood in the way of monetary globalization. Currency geopolitics, where geopolitical factors increasingly determine both the currencies in international trade and the formation of foreign exchange reserves, is not a new phenomenon. After the First World War, geopolitical motives played an important role in selecting international currencies for foreign exchange reserves. While the geopolitical factor remains in the era of currency globalization, it does not dominate the system. From this, it follows that currency globalization and currency geopolitics do not exclude each other at all, but rather complement each other. At the same time,in certain historical periods, as a rule, one of them prevails: either currency globalization or currency geopolitics. It is also important to highlight that the dollar’s status as a global reserve currency is declining not only due to geopolitical factors, but also due to US fiscal policy, which has resulted in central and commercial banks in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates having less and less need for US dollars. The geopolitically driven shift away from the US dollar in trade transactions will reduce its role as a reserve currency, although this role cannot in principle be reduced to zero. In the context of the significant uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the modern geopolitical landscape, and the geopolitical fragmentation of risks resulting from the Western sanctions on Russia, there has been a noteworthy accumulation of gold as an alternative reserve asset, and increase in the use of various currencies in international trade. The euro, while it is the second-largest reserve currency by scale of global distribution, cannot completely replace the US dollar in the global economy. Despite accounting for 21% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves as of 2023, the euro is not reliable as a universal reserve asset. Structural and political problems in the EU, particularly the lack of a coordinated fiscal policy among its member states, undermine its stability and appeal as an alternative to the US dollar. In 2023, both Western-sanctioned Russia and China called for the creation of a multipolar global monetary system. However, the prospect of a near-term transition from US dollar-dominance to an alternative global reserve currency appears unrealistic. BRICS+ (which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, as well as Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates) is seeking to play a significant role in challenging the dominance of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. A key aspect of this strategy is the shift towards conducting oil and gas trade in national currencies, as a result of which prices for them would not be set in US dollars. As a result, these countries have managed to increase the share of trade carried out between them to 65%. The petrodollar system, which emerged in the 1970s to evaluate oil in dollars, significantly reinforced the position of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. However, due to the factors noted above, such as the Western economic sanctions against Russia, many countries have started to seek alternatives to the petrodollar. The growing energy ties between Saudi Arabia and China have contributed to the replacement of the petrodollar with the petro-yuan, with long-term oil trading contracts denominated in yuan. It should be noted that many developing countries had expressed a desire for an alternative to the US dollar long before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This desire grew even stronger after the West imposed sanctions on Russia, including by cutting off many of its banks from SWIFT and freezing its $300 billion in international assets. Although China is increasingly using the renminbi in cross-border payments, its financial system still remains dependent not only on the US dollar, but also on the US financial system, which is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. China’s growing role in global trade has contributed to the yuan’s rise as a global currency, although there are objective reasons (notably strict government controls on capital flows, lack of transparency in financial markets, and centralization of one-party political power) that make many countries reluctant to use it as a reserve currency. The BRICS countries intend to create a new reserve currency backed by a basket of their own national currencies, with the potential for gold-backing in addition. This initiative is expected to accelerate the de-dollarization process, reducing global dependence on the dollar. That said, due to the unresolved nature of many institutional, organizational and technical issues, BRICS is still far from resolving the issue of introducing a new reserve currency. The push for de-dollarization will have serious consequences for both the US and the global economy. In particular, inflationary pressures could increase for the US economy, the US position in international financial institutions may weaken, while developing countries could reduce their dollar debt and gain greater financial autonomy. Although the US dollar is likely to continue its global dominance and retain its role as the world’s main reserve currency in the short and medium term, it is fundamentally unacceptable to overlook the gradual strengthening of the currency geopolitics factor. It should be emphasized that the relationship between cryptocurrencies and geopolitics warrants independent study, as do the geopolitical aspects of central bank digital currencies. In conclusion, we can say that the new world monetary order is being formed as a combination of monetary globalization and monetary geopolitics, in which the latter plays a predominant role.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnYAYd36wrCSz	2024-11-21T09:22:44-08:00	
Ukraine’s Choice: NATO Membership Or Going Nuclear – OpEd	Ukrainian President Zelensky during his speech in Brussels on October 17, surprised many especially Ukrainians, that in the war for its existence, Ukraine now has a choice between NATO membership or manufacturing nuclear weapons. NATO and most governments know well that Ukraine not only has extensive civil nuclear facilities and supplies, but it also has considerable expertise in nuclear weapons manufacturing. Ukraine’s Nuclear History and Capability At the time of Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, estimated at 1,900 strategic warheads, 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and 44 strategic bombers. By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances, and in December 1994, Ukraine became a non-nuclear weapon state-party to the 1968 nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A senior Ukrainian official quoted by Bild was reported to have said earlier this year that: 'We have the material; we have the knowledge. If there is an order, we will only need a few weeks to produce the first bomb.' As Russian forces continue advancing on the battlefield, reports from the Centre for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, Ukraine has the capability to assemble a nuclear weapon within months. The report highlights that Ukraine could rapidly create a bomb using plutonium derived from spent fuel rods. With about seven tons of reactor plutonium available, experts claim the material is sufficient to produce hundreds of warheads with tactical yields. President Zelensky possibly has made these calculative statements as he well knows Firstly that US led NATO is not inclined to induct Ukraine as a NATO member and Secondly Russian President Putin keeps threatening to escalate this war into a nuclear strike if the US sanctions firing of the long-range US made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles into Russia. Ukraine may already have in its possession some kind of a nuclear bomb or even procured one discreetly or clandestinely going by President Zelensky’s statement. President Biden on his way out did sanction firing of the long-range US made ATACMS missiles into Russia. Ukraine firedUS made ATACMS missiles into Russia for the first time on November 19. Will President Putin respond with a nuclear strike now lowering the thresh hold of a nuclear strike? Not likely! The strike in Bryansk marks an intensification of the conflict amid broader uncertainty ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House who has repeatedly stated that he will end the war. So, all the stake holders of the Ukraine-Russia War are taking actions most suited to them before the just months before unpredictable President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office and heralds a potential majorshift in course. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that five out of the six missiles, fired at a target in the country’s Bryansk region, were shot down and that the sixth was damaged, dismissing the attack as largely ineffective. But Ukrainian officials said the strike caused a conflagration at a weapons depot in the city of Karachev, just over 70 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border. If this be the Russian capability to destroy the ATACMS missiles then why should Russia react with a nuclear weapon head strike? Now the Russian Army must be planning to neutralize the ATACMS missile sites. US Vetoes UN Security Council Gaza Ceasefire The US on 20 Nov 2024 vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, drawing harsh criticism from most of the UN members. The draft was put forward by the council's 10 non-permanent members, demanding an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire, as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The 15-member council voted 14-1 in favor of the resolution, and the US used its veto as a permanent council member to block it. North Korean Soldiers deployed in Kursk, Russia Tensions have heightened with reports that up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers have been stationed in Kursk, Russia. If North Korean forces engage in combat, it would further escalate the situation. The open-source intelligence is limited about the strength of North Korean troops in support of the Russian forces. Initial reports were that there are Korean troops to operate their launcher systems for KN-23 missiles having a range of about 300km. Ukrainian sources claim that the Koreans are equipped with the weapons required for front line combat. Wonder the Korean troops have been sent for direct combat with the Ukrainian forces with the potential for escalation. Zelensky Warns NATO Ukrainian President Zelensky during his speech in Brussels on October 17 has indirectly warned NATO that his country may pursue nuclear weapons if it is not granted NATO membership. A press conference was also held alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte who refrained from making any statement. However, later that day, Zelensky said that Ukraine has no intention to pursue nuclear weapons. Ukraine’s foreign ministry also confirmed the country’s commitment to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Zelensky’s rhetoric or Putin’s credible threat or desperate bluffs have finally had the effect on the West post Ukraine fired six long-range US ATACMS missiles at targets inside Russia and President Putin lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons: NATO countries are asking their citizens to be prepared for a war. Have started issuing pamphlets to their citizens, advising them on how to prepare for World War III. Denmark has already sent emails to its citizens to stock up on dry rations, water and medicines so that they could manage for three days of emergency, including a nuclear attack. Finland, too, updated its online brochure on 'preparing for incidents and crises' amid the escalating Russia-Ukraine war. The US and some other Western embassies (The Italian, Greek and Spanish) in Kyiv remained closed on November 20, having received a warning of a potentially significant Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital. 'On his way out of office, Joe Biden is dangerously trying to start WW III by authorizing Ukraine the use of US long range missiles into Russia. The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems.' — Marjorie Taylor Green, Congress representative for Georgia, X post, 14 Nov 2024. And now the US vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Is it to put Trump and his team into a difficult position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Middle East as during his campaign, Trump has vowed to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours if he regains the presidency. He previously has called President Zelensky 'the greatest salesman on Earth.' Zelensky’s rhetorics or Putin’s credible threats or desperate Nuclear bluffs are not likely as Putin is also keen to end the war and expects Trump to mediate a negotiation between the two warring nations to fulfill his promise and also prove that he is a world leader. Russia’s war against Ukraine presently is central to America’s great power competition against the Russia–China–Iran–North Korea axis. How Team Trump plays their cards differently than Biden’s administration is to be seen in beginning 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnYs8972QQGta	2024-11-21T09:21:16-08:00	
Ukraine War: UN Peace Forces As Part Of A Comprehensive Peace Dea...	By Jonathan Power To its credit the Soviet Union and its successor state, Russia, has long supported UN peacekeeping, a practice that originated in 1960 in the time of UN Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, who evolved the concept during the great Congolese civil war when it was in danger of becoming a Cold War flashpoint. But what Russia has never contemplated is UN troops in its own backyard. 'Summoning the UN deep into Russia’s historical space is a serious step', Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Centre, told The Economist. There does seem to be a shift in Moscow’s thinking on this highly sensitive issue. In 2017 President Vladimir Putin put forward a plan for the deployment of UN troops in south-eastern Ukraine. Not that he imagined their use along the Russian/Ukrainian border—that would be too much—but he wanted them to divide the fighting forces inside Ukraine. An objection is that this would formalise the internal division in Ukraine. But even so it was a bold move as it would mean UN soldiers getting in the way of the secessionist, Russian-orientated, militia in south-eastern Ukraine. They wouldn’t be able to expand the territory they already control without overrunning UN troops. The idea of a UN peacekeeping operation in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, was first discussed over a decade and a half ago by a small group of independent Russian and American experts on the Finnish island of Boisto. Their proposals were rejected by both the Ukrainian government and Moscow. Moreover, the cease-fire negotiated at Minsk by Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine in February 2015 was regularly violated and some of the heavy weapons that were pulled back from the demarcation line returned. The Minsk 11 agreement also lost its initial momentum. Moscow justifiably blames Kiev for not implementing the agreement. Critical promises were not followed through, such as changing the country’s constitution, passing a law to establish the special status of the Donetsk and Lugansk enclaves in Donbas, underlining their Russian-language rights, holding elections and declaring an amnesty. A divided government led by Petro Poroshenko, partly under the influence of right-wing movements whose pedigree stretches back to Nazi times, was incapable of moving on these vital issues. Putin still seems to think he can go on hoodwinking the world about Russia’s early role. He maintains that the 'soldiers are men following the call of their hearts to fulfil their duty or are voluntarily taking part in hostilities, including in south-east Ukraine'. Russia appeared to believe that without these local militias the Poroshenko government would have just walked in. Both in Washington and Moscow some macho policy makers and in particular Putin himself, have talked about the necessity of preparations for a limited nuclear war (although, in all probability, there never could be a limited one—recall the joint Ronald Reagan/Mikhail Gorbachev statement that a nuclear war 'could never be won and must never be fought'. This is why some of us think Putin’s talk of a UN role is a big step forward. Fyodor Lukyanov, who edits the influential Global Affairs, and who has the ear of the Russian Foreign Ministry, argues that Putin should expand his UN ideas. According to Alexei Arbatov, head of Russia’s Centre for International Security, a UN force must be strong enough to ensure a 100% cease-fire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. The mission would look less like the failure in Kosovo in 1999 and more like the success in Cyprus that began in 1974, separating the Greek-speaking half of the island from the Turkish-speaking. UN forces have been deployed along the dividing line for over 50 years and are still there. They have held back what many Greeks have long believed is the danger of a renewed threat of ethnic cleansing of the kind that the Turks tried to carry out in 1974. At first the UN troops had to fight their way in. In the Ukraine case, peace between the two sides in Donbas would not be just a dividing line between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces, it would probably in time bring peace on the Russian-Ukraine border. Putin’s now old idea must be explored. With Ukraine’s army losing out is a good time to explore it as part of an all-encompassing peace deal. For 17 years, Jonathan Power was a foreign affairs columnist for the International Herald Tribune.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnUVSH0qoyici	2024-11-21T09:15:09-08:00	
A Mahdi, Messiahs, And Wonderful Non-Jewish Leaders – OpEd	Muslims say: 'There is no god but Allah' and people should worship only him, rejecting idolatry and polytheism. Jews agree. Muslims believe Allah created the world in six days and so do Jews and Christians. Allah sent thousands of Prophets to all of the tribes, nations and kingdoms in the world; and 313 Messengers such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad, who brought to their believers a special sacred book. Jews and Christians can also agree to this. All prophets and their followers were Muslims (submitters to the one and only God), though Muslims do tend to conflate the general and specific meanings of the words Islam and Muslim. Five messenger prophets received scriptures from Allah, notably the Pages of Abraham (now lost), the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus. Most Muslim scholars in later generations claimed that these messages and books had become corrupted or were lost. Jews and Christians strongly reject this slander because the Qur'an itself states: 'So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scriptures before you (the Jews and Christians). The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (10:94) Unlike the biblical Yahweh (often misread as Jehovah), Allah has no personal name, and his traditional 99 names are really epithets. Muslims claim to totally reject anthropomorphic descriptions of Allah, yet the Qur'an sometimes describes Allah as speaking, sitting on a throne, and having a face, eyes and hands. Allah is also the Master of the Day of Judgment, when the good, especially believers, will be sent to their heavenly reward, and the wicked, especially unbelievers, will be dispatched to hellfire. Jews and Christians also have traditions about end of days judgments, Armageddon, Gog —Magog and redemptive Messiahs. Judaism and, Christianity and Islam all teach their followers to take care of the earth. They also believe that humans should act as guardians and trustees (stewardship and khalifah) for the planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. Recent Jewish and Christian history enables us to understand in a new way Isaiah's famous passage (Isaiah 52:13-53:12) about God's servant whose tragic suffering can be redemptive to those who once reviled and belittled him. In Jewish thought the Prophet Isaiah himself provides the strongest evidence for the claim that God's servant is Israel, the Jewish People. Four verses in prior chapters of Isaiah specifically state that Israel/Jacob is God's servant. 'You Israel are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen' (41:8), 'Hear me now, Jacob my servant; hear me, Israel my chosen' (44:1), 'Have no fear, Jacob my servant: Jeshurun whom I have chosen' (44:2), 'Remember all this, Jacob, remember Israel, for you are my servant' (44:21). These verses make it clear that Israel/Jacob is God's chosen servant. The national community is spoken of in terms of an individual, as is often the case in the Bible (see Jeremiah 30:10). However, many rabbis did identify Isaiah's messianic figure as a person, usually as a Messiah, a descendant of David, from the tribe of Judah. Other Rabbis had other interpretations. Rabbi Sa'adyah Ga'on glosses the figure as referring to the Prophet Jeremiah. Rabbi Isaac Abarbanel rejects that and thinks the suffering servant is Josiah, King of Israel. I think this individual is a messianic figure called by the rabbis: Messiah, son of Joseph, i.e. from one of the northern tribes, who precedes David's son, and is killed in battle by the enemies of Israel. If we keep in mind both the Josephson messiah as well as the role of Israel/Jacob as God's chosen servant, we will better understand Isaiah's suffering servant prophecy. The belief that there would be two different messiahs, one a moral political leader from the house of David (Davidson) and the other, a religious reformer from the house of Aaron (Aronson), as well as a special 'end of days' prophet such as Elijah or Jeremiah (Matthew 16:14) is found in inter- testament literature. A Dead Sea scroll states that the Qumran community must continue to live according to the original discipline 'until there shall come a prophet (Elijah) and the Messiahs of Aaron and Israel' (Manual of Discipline 9:11). There is also a rabbinic belief in a messianic figure from the northern tribes called a Josephson messiah who is killed by Israel's enemies. This idea may be modeled on the example of Saul who reigned before David and was killed in battle by the enemies of Israel. Thus there could be as many as four individual messianic figures as well as the people of Israel who act as God's agents in bringing about the Messianic Age. Gentile rulers also play a role, first as destructive oppressors of the Jewish people, and second when their successors later acknowledge their error and are ultimately included in helping bring about the Messianic Age's worldwide blessings. The Persian King Cyrus was such a messiah (Isaiah 45:1) All of this makes for a complicated future scenario that might take generations, or even centuries to develop. When people are persecuted, afflicted and oppressed as a community, and despised and rejected as individuals, they need hope for a much quicker and simpler process of redemption. This is why there is an overwhelming focus on the final stage Davidson messiah by most teachers, preachers, commentators and expositors. This is also the reason that those who believe in the imminent coming of the Davidson messiah always think it will occur soon within their lifetime (John 14:19, 21:22). Islam adds to all these Messiahs the figure of a Mahdi (Arabic: ٱلْمَهْدِيّ al-Mahdī). A messianic figure in Islamic eschatology who will appear at the end of times to rid the world of evil and injustice. Said to be a descendant of Muhammad, and thus a descendant of Prophet Abraham, he will appear shortly before Prophet ʿĪsā (Jesus) and defeat the evil forces of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj or Ajuj and Majuj). Gog and Magog appear metaphorically in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Quran as individuals, tribes, nations, catastrophes of nature; and in our own days as racist nationalist states and political movements. The Quran mentions Gog and Magog twice: 'He said: 'This (barrier) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the warning of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to dust (and Gog and Magog—the Colonialist Empires, the Nazi racists, and the Communists would be released into the world); and the promise of my Lord is true.' (Qur'an 18:98) So Gog and Magog are destructive groups like the Colonialist Empires, Nazi racists, and the Communists, as well as widespread human pollution of Mother Earth, that near the time of the end of days will penetrate every part of the world like the persistently high levels of ozone pollution in Asia that are costing China, Japan and South Korea an estimated $63 billion annually in lost rice, wheat and maize crops. The other mention of Gog and Magog in the Quran is: 'But there is a ban on a town which We have destroyed: that they (the people of the town) shall not return (to reclaim that town as their own); until Gog and Magog are let through (the barrier), and swiftly spread out in every direction.' (Qur'an 21:95-96) This verse refers to Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, and only reclaimed 18 1/2 centuries later as the State of Israel's capital, following the era of the defeat of the Nazis, the Communists, and the Colonialist Empires, who had been Gog and Magog for many generations. Though the Mahdi is not mentioned in the Quran, and is absent from the two most-revered Sunni hadith collections: Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim – he is mentioned in other Hadith literature; and Islamic end-time images of pre Judgement Days natural catastrophes are similar to Christian and Jewish imagery of nature's potential disruptiveness (plagues, famine, draught, earthquakes etc.). Also, since humans have free will, the exact time and manner of redemption cannot be determined in advance. Much depends on what we do. Repentance produces changes in the future of both individuals and nations. Repentance enables some individuals and communities to escape the consequences of prior evil. On the other hand, God's promise is that evil powers will never succeed in destroying Israel or in overcoming worldwide justice in the long run. Thus even without full repentance, God will act if the Divine promise of a Messianic Age is threatened. As Isaiah states a few verses prior to the suffering servant passage, 'The Lord says: you were sold but no price was paid, and without payment you shall be redeemed.' (52:3) i.e. all your suffering in exile was not merited and your redemption from exile will not be fully earned. Both are part of God's outline for human destiny and will occur sooner (through repentance) or later (in God's own time). Finally, if one believes that God inspired prophets are able to describe scenarios of various developments in the distant future then one has to accept that the understanding of these passages should change and improve as we come closer and closer to the times they describe. As an example, Jeremiah describes a radical future in which women surround men, 'The Lord will create a new thing on earth-a woman will surround a man' (31:22). The great commentator Rashi understands 'surround' to mean encircle. The most radical thing Rashi can think of (and in 11th century France it was radical) is that women will propose marriage (a wedding ring, or encircling the groom at the wedding ceremony) to men. In today's feminist generation we can see women surrounding men in many fields once almost exclusively male such as law, medical and theological schools. This means that a few generations from now we might have even better understandings of some predictive passages in the prophets, so humility should always be with us. Now let us try to understand the suffering servant passage in light of 20th century Jewish history. Isaiah proclaims the good news of peace and salvation (52:7) when God returns to Zion (8) and comforts his people (9) so all the Gentiles see his salvation (10). The Jewish people will depart the exile not in flight but under God's protection (11&12). Israel/Jacob, God's servant, whose appearance (14) was disfigured, marred and appalling (during the holocaust) will prosper (13) and be lifted up (in subsequent generations). A marvel for many nations, whose rulers will shut their (anti-Semitic) mouths because of this, since they will see what they had not been taught and will understand what they never heard of (15). For centuries the Church taught that the Jews were being punished for rejecting Christ and couldn't be redeemed without believing Jesus was the Son of God. Now some Gentile rulers see that this teaching is not really correct doctrine. The biblical message of God's commitment to redeem Israel without explicitly believing in Jesus wasn't believed (53:1) but now there is a growing minority who affirm a two covenant theology. Many Gentile rulers (kings, governments, business and religious leaders) now admit what their anti-Semitism did to the people of Israel. The Jews were like a tender shoot in dry ground, unattractive and undesirable, despised and rejected, sorrowful and familiar (intimate) with suffering (52:2&3). We (the Gentile rulers) scapegoated them and they carried our projected infirmities, but we rationalized that the Jews were stricken and afflicted by God, not by us. Israel was pierced and crushed due to our transgressions (anti-Semitism) for we sought our peace by blaming Jews for all kinds of evils (54:4&5). This anti-Semitism led to: Crusaders slaughtering Jews in France and Germany, blaming Jews for the Bubonic Plague in central Europe, torture by the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, many expulsions and pogroms at various times throughout Europe, and the deaths of tens of thousands of Jewish civilians massacred during wars in Poland (1648-9) and the Ukraine (1919-21). All this set the stage for the worst martyrdom of all, the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust (plus five million non-Jews). Each evil regime turned its own kind of iniquity (religious, political, economic and social) on its Jews (54:6). Again and again Jews were passively taken away to exile, or like sheep to the slaughter cut off from the land of the living, though they had done no violence (54:7-9). Yet faithful Jews accepted all this as God's will and refused to abandon their religion or their people. Survivors of the concentration camps, who had lost their entire family, had the courage and faith to marry, and lived to see their offspring (Jewish children and grandchildren) grow up (54:10). Many, whose days were prolonged (54:10) and are now in their 70's and 80's, have lived long enough to see the most amazing outcomes of the Holocaust. The return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and the rebuilding of its cities and countryside are the subject of many passages in Isaiah both preceding chapter 53 and following it. The realization of these prophecies did not require a Holocaust. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the mass departure of more than one million Soviet Jews to the land of Israel also are not directly linked to the Holocaust.But the redemptive aspect of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust for Gentile rulers and nations is emphasized in this suffering servant passage. Of course, the Turkish government still denies responsibility for the death of over one million Armenians; the Japanese deny slaughtering 300,000 residents of Nanking during WW2, and only a few French leaders admit to the complicity of the Vichy government in rounding up Jews for the Nazi death camps. Even the UN has not officially admitted its dereliction of duty in the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda. Yet the few steps of public confession and atonement that have been taken by some political and religious leaders are truly remarkable when you consider that nothing like this has ever happened in previous human history. If the Holocaust stimulated a willingness of religious and political leaders to accept responsibility for past examples of persecution and iniquity done by their institutions and governments continues to expand, society will improve greatly. If other governments and institutions admit responsibility for the sins of their predecessors it reduces the likelihood of repetition. Then the numbering of God's innocent servant- Israel/Jacob with transgressors will, when the lessons are finally learned, justify not just those directly involved in the atonement process but also many others. Israel's pouring out of life (six million deaths) will not have been in vain, and the revivified Jewish people will see the light of life and be satisfied (54:11-12). The ability of Christians and Jews to understand that both religions' interpretation of Isaiah's Suffering Servant has helped bring us closer to an age of increased human rights will lead to a greater demand for universal peace and security. (Isaiah 2:1-4 and Micah 4:1-8) Christians have always stressed the individual aspects of personal self sacrifice for salvation. By adding national and organizational aspects, Christians can help elevate the moral level of political and organizational behavior. When current political and religious leaders feel the need to publicly acknowledge the sins of their predecessors, itt helps to reduce the level of self righteousness that usually accompanies the corruption of political and religious power. It also warns religious people and their leaders that in the words of Pascal, 'Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.' Jews can now begin to understand how the role of Jesus as the Josephson Messiah, and the example of the passion of Jesus, has motivated many political and religious leaders in our generation to apologize for evils they personally did not do, in order to set the record right. The Davidson messiah will come after all nations, religions and political parties learn to respect and value as a gift from God, each other's right to differ in large as well as small issues. (Micah 4:5) Since this religious reform requires great leadership from all the major religions, each religion will have to produce its own Aronson religious reformer Messianic Mahdi figure. These many messianic mahdi religious reformers are referred to by Prophet Jeremiah positively as 'shepherds' (3:14-18) and their teachings will provide each religion with a reformed and renewed covenant (31:31-34). The advocacy of religious pluralism by the major religious communities will then produce the bases for the ultimate messianic predictions of worldwide peace, justice, prosperity, and salvation that the prophets proclaimed so often. The Davidson Messiah will come last to crown our faith in God's inspiration and deliverance. Until then let us remember that the Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 'On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnTu5aiHOBFZ0	2024-11-21T09:10:56-08:00	
Maryam Rajavi’s Conference At European Parliament And The Shamefu...	On Wednesday, November 20, 2024, a major parliamentary conference titled 'A New Policy on Iran: Centred on the People and Resistance' was held at the European Union headquarters in Brussels. The conference featured Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), alongside several Members of the European Parliament. Yet, shockingly, none of the Persian-language media outlets affiliated with European governments covered the event. This omission is not just regrettable and shameful, but catastrophic, as it serves the interests of the Iranian regime by censoring, suppressing, and distorting the Iranian Resistance Movement. In her address, Mrs. Rajavi emphasized that 'Democratic change in Iran is an achievable goal.' She continued, 'Today, I have come to the home of European democracy to declare that the regime’s terrorism and warmongering can be brought to an end. The overthrow and democratic transformation of this regime by the people and resistance of Iran is achievable and within reach.' Mrs. Rajavi then outlined the key components needed to achieve this goal: 1. The People and the Resistance: The Iranian people are deeply discontented, with widespread anger and frustration. This movement is supported by rebellious units (components of the National Liberation Army of Iran) that challenge the regime’s oppressive grip. Women, leading this movement, are at the forefront of Iran's fight for freedom and change. Video clips showcasing 20,000 acts of resistance across Iran were presented at the NCRI’s annual gathering in July 2023. 2. The People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK): This organization, with its thousands of experienced cadres, has fought for 60 years against both the Shah’s dictatorship and the current mullahs’ regime. It has sacrificed thousands of martyrs and is considered the regime’s primary adversary. 3. A Democratic Alternative: The NCRI, founded 43 years ago by Massoud Rajavi, consists of 457 members representing diverse political ideologies, making it the longest-standing political coalition in Iranian history. It advocates for freedoms, women’s rights, national autonomy, equality between Sunni and Shia Muslims, the separation of religion from state, the abolition of the death penalty, a non-nuclear Iran, and peace in the Middle East. In 2002, the NCRI exposed the regime’s secret nuclear facilities, at great cost to itself. 4. Widespread Support and Endurance: The Iranian Resistance has organized the largest gatherings of Iranians abroad, demonstrating the broad support base within Iran. Families of 100,000 martyrs and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners over the last 45 years stand behind this movement. A network of Iranian professionals, organized into 320 associations worldwide, plays a crucial role in rebuilding Iran’s future. This resistance operates independently, relying on self-sufficiency for its funding. Its members cover the costs for daily operations, communications, publications, gatherings, and a 24-hour satellite TV channel that broadcasts to Iran. 5. International Support for the NCRI’s 10-Point Plan: The NCRI’s 10-point plan for a free Iran has received widespread endorsement, including statements from 34 parliamentary majorities across Europe and the U.S., as well as some Arab countries. Furthermore, 137 former world leaders and 80 Nobel laureates have supported this initiative, underscoring their belief in establishing a democratic republic in Iran, rejecting both religious and monarchical dictatorships. Censorship and the Right to Information in the European Union The right to the free flow of information is a cornerstone of democracy and human rights in the European Union. This right ensures that citizens and residents have access to information held by governments and public bodies. Articles 10 and 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantee freedom of expression, protecting the right to receive and disseminate information without government interference. However, this fundamental principle is being violated in the case of the Iranian Resistance Movement, particularly by European media and institutions. The EU’s appeasement policies toward the Iranian regime have contributed to the suppression and distortion of the Resistance Movement’s narrative. This censorship is part of a long-standing pattern: The deportation and exile of NCRI supporters to Gabon in the 1980s. Blacklisting the Resistance Movement in the 1990s to appease Iran’s then-President Khatami. The June 17, 2003, raid on the NCRI’s headquarters in France under President Chirac. Illegal obstruction of MEK demonstrations in Berlin and Paris. Illegal Obstruction of MEK Demonstrations in Berlin and France In 2005, the German government obstructed a demonstration by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) in Berlin. However, the court ruled this action illegal, allowing the MEK to hold the demonstration. This event highlighted repeated efforts to restrict the group’s political activities in Europe and the MEK’s legal efforts to challenge these restrictions. Similarly, in 2023, the French government attempted to block a MEK demonstration in Paris at the request of the Iranian regime. However, a court ruled the French government’s actions illegal, permitting the protest to take place. Censorship, by nature, involves restricting or controlling information and suppressing dissenting political views. Typically enforced by authoritarian regimes, its consequences include the erosion of free speech, the stifling of creativity and innovation, diminished public awareness, historical distortion, and the promotion of extremism. While it is not surprising for authoritarian regimes to impose such policies, it is deeply troubling when European-affiliated media adopt these tactics against a legitimate resistance movement. This complicity effectively serves the interests of Iran’s tyrannical and terrorist regime, which fuels extremism, terrorism, and instability in the region and beyond. Iran’s Regime and Terrorism: The 2018 Bombing Plot A prominent example of the Iranian regime’s involvement in terrorism occurred in 2018 when an attempt to bomb a major MEK rally in Paris was thwarted. The plot, orchestrated by the Iranian regime, saw one of its diplomats, Assadollah Assadi, arrested. Assadi, a diplomat stationed at Iran’s embassy in Austria, was convicted of terrorism charges in Belgium. Despite his conviction, he was controversially exchanged by the Belgian government and sent back to Iran.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWex_-HLcm7mnT9fCSZuBI_-	2024-11-21T09:08:49-08:00	
Prince Igor At The Ankara Opera: The Power Of Art – OpEd	Last night, we had the pleasure of watching Alexander Borodin's timeless masterpiece, Prince Igor, at the Ankara Opera. The production captivated the audience, showcasing not only Borodin's years of dedication but also the stellar performance on stage. The History Behind the Masterpiece Borodin worked on Prince Igor for nearly twenty years but passed away in 1887 before completing it. After his death, his close friends Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov gathered the drafts from Borodin's home and finished the opera. The work premiered in 1890 at the renowned Mariinsky Opera in St. Petersburg. Inspired by The Lay of Igor's Campaign, a significant epic in Russian literature, the opera tells the story of 12th-century Prince Igor Svyatoslavich and his campaign against the Cuman (Polovtsian) tribes. The Performance in Ankara In Ankara, the opera was performed in its original Russian language. The choir and soloists delivered outstanding performances that earned high praise from the audience. Conductor Sunay Muratov expertly led the orchestra, ensuring a flawless musical execution. The Russian origins of director Ilya Ilin added an authentic touch to the staging, enriching the overall experience. The cast featured Çetin Kıranbay as Prince Igor, Burcu Uyar as Yaroslavna, Ayhan Üştük as Vladimir Igorevich, Erdem Baydar as Prens Galçtski, and Can Kocaay as Konçak Han. Each performer brought depth and nuance to their characters, leaving a lasting impression. Polovtsian Dances: The Highlight of the Evening The most striking moment of the opera came during the final scene with the Polovtsian Dances. This mesmerizing blend of opera and ballet showcased an exceptional harmony of music and visuals, taking the audience on a historical journey. The performance was nothing short of breathtaking. A Recommendation for Art Enthusiasts For those who wish to experience the unparalleled magic of art and music, Prince Igor is an absolute must-see. The Ankara Opera artists have brought this masterpiece to life with extraordinary skill, providing an unforgettable evening. A true gem for classical music and opera lovers alike.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-djmfSxqyDz7	2024-11-21T09:06:48-08:00	
Moroccan Media And The Final Phase Of The Sahara Issue: A Call Fo...	As Morocco moves closer to achieving the full international recognition of its territorial integrity, the role of the media in shaping perceptions and bolstering national advocacy is entering a decisive phase. This is no longer about reaffirming sovereignty; it is about strategically consolidating Morocco's historical and legitimate rights on the global stage. For Moroccan journalists, this means rethinking the fundamentals of their approach to the Sahara issue, anticipating new dynamics, and preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. This imperative was at the heart of a recent conference organized by the Alliance of Istiqlali Journalists under the theme, 'Moroccan Media and the Cause of the Kingdom's Territorial Integrity: Crossed Perspectives.' The event, held on November 19, featured Professor Hassan Abdelkhalek—a veteran journalist, former editor-in-chief of Al Alam, and Morocco's ambassador to Algeria from 2016 to 2021. His unique expertise, spanning both media and diplomacy, provided critical insights into the evolving landscape of this decades-long dispute. One of the conference's main conclusions was clear: Moroccan media must not only sustain its mobilization for the Sahara but also refine its tools, narratives, and strategies. The current phase is one of pre-resolution—a delicate juncture where misinformation and propaganda continue to distort the realities of the conflict. It is essential for journalists to adapt, using innovative methods and persuasive arguments to counter outdated narratives driven by Algeria's hegemonic ambitions and the Polisario's misinformation campaigns. A particularly pressing issue raised during the event was the need to anticipate the eventual reintegration of thousands of Moroccans held or displaced in the Tindouf camps. These individuals have been subjected to decades of ideological manipulation and propaganda aimed at severing their ties to Morocco. Rehabilitating them will require not only social and logistical efforts but also a robust media strategy to dismantle the falsehoods ingrained over generations. Moroccan media must be ready to support this process, offering narratives of hope, inclusion, and unity that pave the way for their full reintegration into Moroccan society. The international dimension of this advocacy is equally critical. Morocco's position has gained unprecedented momentum in recent years, underscored by the recognition of its sovereignty over the Sahara by key global players. However, maintaining and expanding this support requires sustained media engagement. Moroccan journalists must project a credible and compelling narrative, emphasizing the legitimacy of Morocco's claims and exposing the artificial nature of the conflict, which has been perpetuated by Algeria's geopolitical ambitions. This moment is a turning point. The Moroccan Sahara is no longer just a territorial dispute; it is a national cause that encompasses identity, history, and the future of regional stability. The media's role must extend beyond advocacy to become a force for reconciliation and cohesion in a post-resolution era. By amplifying Morocco's achievements, countering hostile narratives, and preparing for the reintegration of all its citizens, the media can play a transformative role in shaping this new chapter. The Moroccan press stands at a historic crossroads. Success will depend on its ability to adapt to the demands of this decisive phase, balancing professionalism with patriotic duty. The stakes are immense, but so are the opportunities to reaffirm Morocco's rightful place as a model of unity and legitimacy in the face of decades of manufactured conflict. The time for strategic, forward-thinking media advocacy is now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-bNAD49RXSM8	2024-11-21T09:03:20-08:00	
Strengthening Pakistan’s Counter-Terrorism Efforts With Global Su...	The recent terrorist attack in Quetta, which claimed the lives of at least 26 people, has drawn widespread condemnation and support from the international community. From China to Russia, and from the UN to regional neighbors like Iran and Sri Lanka, global leaders have voiced their solidarity with Pakistan in its counter-terrorism efforts. However, beyond expressions of sympathy, there lies a pressing need for tangible support, enhanced collaboration, and coordinated counter-terrorism strategies to bolster Pakistan's efforts. China-Pakistan Collaboration: More Than Just Condemnation China’s response, led by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, reflects an enduring alliance marked by shared interests and significant economic investments, such as CPEC. The injury of two Chinese nationals in Karachi highlights the threat that terrorism poses not only to Pakistanis but also to foreign partners. China’s vocal support for Pakistan’s counter-terrorism operations is essential, but it must be matched with sustained bilateral counter-terrorism initiatives, including security training, intelligence-sharing, and joint task forces to protect CPEC investments and Chinese citizens. Russia’s Firm Stance and Its Implications for Pakistan Russia, under President Putin’s leadership, has consistently voiced its commitment to assist Pakistan in combating terrorism. Putin’s condemnation of the Quetta attack and his call for justice are welcome affirmations of Russia’s support. Pakistan and Russia have a mutual understanding when it comes to countering terrorism; both nations have encountered extremist threats that have shaped their security policies. Moving forward, Pakistan should explore deeper military collaboration with Russia, including joint anti-terrorism drills, intelligence-sharing, and even arms deals aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s counter-terrorism capabilities. UN and Global Institutions: From Words to Action UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and called for accountability. While these statements are critical for maintaining international awareness, the United Nations and its associated agencies have an opportunity to play a more direct role in Pakistan’s fight against terrorism. Programs that provide counter-terrorism training, funding for security enhancements, and expertise on deradicalization can make a lasting impact. The UN’s endorsement of anti-terrorism efforts in Pakistan also strengthens the case for international donors to invest in Pakistan’s security sector, which remains vital for ensuring sustained stability. Regional Solidarity: Iran, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia The tragedy has drawn powerful responses from regional players, including Iran and Sri Lanka, both of whom are no strangers to terrorism. Iran, whose spokesperson underscored the need to uphold human rights and reject terrorism in all forms, shares a long border with Pakistan, making coordinated border security essential. Sri Lanka, reflecting on its own history of combating separatist terrorism, has also extended support, reiterating the shared regional interest in stability. By leveraging such solidarity, Pakistan can build regional coalitions to tackle cross-border terrorist networks and enhance border security. A Call for Multilateral Action Against Terrorism The responses to Pakistan’s tragedy showcase a rare alignment of global voices against terrorism, but they should serve as more than symbolic gestures. This is an opportunity for the international community to establish or strengthen multilateral frameworks that address terrorism with a particular focus on South Asia. Forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) can play a pivotal role in supporting Pakistan’s efforts, creating shared strategies for intelligence, surveillance, and securing borders. Global action, beyond just statements, will be instrumental in sustaining Pakistan’s efforts to prevent future tragedies. Pakistan’s own determination to root out terrorism within its borders is evident, but it cannot achieve this goal without the continued backing of its international allies. Not only do such partnerships alleviate some of the strain on Pakistan’s resources, but they also reinforce its stance on countering extremism, helping isolate those elements that threaten both regional and global peace. Pakistan has the potential to be a strong pillar in the fight against terrorism, provided it is equipped with the resources and alliances necessary to overcome the challenges it faces. Conclusion: Building a Future Without Terrorism The Quetta tragedy is a reminder of the stakes involved in the fight against terrorism. Pakistan’s resilience, supported by the international community’s tangible assistance, can foster a more secure future for its citizens and allies. As countries rally behind Pakistan, this tragic event serves as a catalyst for deeper cooperation and mutual resolve to eliminate terrorism from the region and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-fwEODyNaIi_	2024-11-21T09:00:54-08:00	
India: Cherishing Classical Status To Asomiya Language – OpEd	A function to commemorate the completion of 53 years by the Directorate of Cultural Affairs (under Assam government in northeast India) turned a serious and fruitful event to cherish the recognition to Asomiya (Assamese) as a classical language and also highlight the future course of actions for the government, concerned organisations, literary personalities and common people using the language both in written and colloquial forms in day-to-day conversations. The courtyard of iconic Rabindra Bhawan in Guwahati was decorated elegantly for the occasion with a colourful podium under Bokul (Spanish Cherry) plants. As evening Sun set to disappear on the mighty river Brahmaputra touching the horizon, the intriguing program commenced with the participation of three outstanding resource persons in front of a decent gathering. The panellists were unanimous in advocating for a comprehensive dictionary with standardised spellings to each and every word. They also emphasized on an internet-savvy apparatus to cross-check the mistakes instantly so that more and more correct words can be pumped into the digital space. Various jargons reflecting the useful modern technology needs to be incorporated possibly with authentic Assamese words and a careful monitoring of the language in the public domain emerge as the need of the hour. Earning the classical recognition as nearly two million people use Asomiya for their primary mode of communication and informal understanding, the language possesses a brighter future, argued the participants amidst rounds of applause from the audience, assembled in the historic cultural premise of northeast India. Director Rahul Ch Das welcomed everyone to the discussion on সুৱদি সুৰীয়া অসমীয়া ভাষা আৰু ধ্ৰুপদী মৰ্যাদা (Delightful & melodious Assamese language and the classical recognition) highlighting the eventful journey of Asomiya for the achievement and also essential future plans for the language, where three resourceful speakers enriched the initiative with refreshing inputs. Dr Namita Devi from Barbhag College (under Gauhati University) narrated the voyage for the attainment, where litterateur, researcher and linguistic expert Dr Upen Rabha Hakacham from GU highlighted the historical inventiveness for assimilation to enhance the Assamese language & culture and Dr Arup Kumar Nath from Tezpur University spoke about the future trail for the language in the session, which was moderated by this writer. Elaborating her views, Namita Devi stated human society and civilisation are shaped through historical evolution that passes through a relentless process of synthesis and antithesis. Humans, as a species known as Homo sapiens, have developed language and culture through the assimilation process as people are migratory in nature and came into contact with different stock of people. The word culture indicates ideas, customs and social behaviours of a particular community and its traits and features reflect a specific character and identity. Same process follows for a language too, added the young and ingenious lady. Assamese language and culture are rooted in ancient Assam from the days of Pragjyotish-Kamrup-Kamata-Koch, where the language was formed by a group of people even though they were divided anthropologically and linguistically. Till today, each group maintains distinctive linguistic and cultural features. Linguistically, Assamese is a composite form of all tribes and stock of people living together and expressing their collective culture through it. Thus, the recognition of Assamese as a classical language has cleared the roots and identity of the culture with a strong foothold. It's time for the new generation to come forward with an effort to preserve, nourish and expand the language and cumulative culture of Assam, she stressed. Dr Nath also threw light on the glorious past of the easternmost Indo-Aryan language, which had its presence in rock different inscriptions, Charyapadas (ancient Buddhist tantric text), Ramayani & other mythology literature since the 4th century. Due to internal and external threats from various sources, Asomiya had to confront many challenges over time. With the classical status on its cap, the language (and its users) can now think of achieving many new heights in the days to come, commented the energetic scholar. He concluded with some valuable advices for the language-users including the need for advanced technological tools (like text to speech and vice versa, advanced machine learning, pdf to word conversion, etc), a solid unicode support, adequate technical terminology in Assamese and so on for the survival and flourishing of the language. Mentionable is that the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 3 October 2024 approved conferring the classical language status to Asomiya along with Marathi, Pali, Prakrit and Bengali/Bangla citing it to serve as a custodian of Bharat's profound and ancient cultural heritage, embodying the essence of each community's historical and cultural milestone. Primarily rooted in Sanskrit (even though maintaining some distinct features) Asomiya thus got an entry to the prestigious group of languages comprising Tamil (notified in 2004), Sanskrit (2005), Telugu (2008), Kannada (2008), Malayalam (2013) and Odia (2014). The specific initiative to celebrate the recognition was also augmented by the gracious presence of distinguished personalities like actor Malaya Goswami, singer Manisha Hazarika, author Satyashree Das, former cultural affairs directors including Swapnanil Barua, Barnali Sarma, Bishnu Kamal Borah with a number of students from Luit Konwar Rudra Barua State Music College and many others.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-fSsGeDso5kF	2024-11-21T08:59:27-08:00	
Pakistan’s Palestine Conundrum – OpEd	The ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues to evoke profound concern across the world, compelling nations to reassess their responsibilities in upholding justice, human rights, and international law. In this dire context, Pakistan has emerged as a steadfast ally of the Palestinian people, vehemently advocating for their right to self-determination and an end to Israel's illegal occupation. France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot recently highlighted a 'window of opportunity' for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, a sentiment Pakistan wholeheartedly echoes. Islamabad sees this as a vital chance to halt violence, protect lives, and foster an environment conducive to dialogue and lasting peace. However, achieving this requires decisive global action, coupled with unwavering support for the Palestinian people. Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause stems from its deeply rooted principles of justice, equality, and respect for sovereignty. Since the inception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Pakistan has consistently condemned the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and the systemic oppression of its people. Successive Pakistani governments have reinforced this stance in international forums, underscoring the importance of a just resolution to the crisis. Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar recently reiterated Pakistan’s solidarity with Palestine, highlighting that the fight for Palestinian sovereignty is not just a regional issue but a universal one tied to fundamental human rights. His government has worked to amplify Palestine’s voice in platforms like the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), emphasizing that justice delayed is justice denied. At the heart of Pakistan’s advocacy is a demand for accountability. Israel's actions, which have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, must not go unchecked. Pakistan urges the international community to hold Israel accountable for its violations of international law and its persistent disregard for human rights. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached catastrophic proportions. Blockades have crippled access to essential goods, while relentless airstrikes have reduced infrastructure to rubble. Civilians, particularly women and children, are disproportionately affected, with schools, hospitals, and shelters bearing the brunt of the violence. Pakistan has called for immediate international intervention to address this crisis. A sustainable ceasefire is a pressing need, but it must be accompanied by substantial humanitarian aid. The blockade on Gaza must be lifted to ensure that food, water, medicine, and essential supplies reach those in dire need. The international community must also support the reconstruction of Gaza’s destroyed infrastructure and provide psychological aid to a traumatized population. France’s call for a ceasefire reflects a growing recognition among global leaders of the need to act urgently. However, such calls must be translated into tangible action. Words alone cannot mitigate the immense suffering of the Palestinian people. Pakistan emphasizes the need for sustained international pressure on Israel to halt its military operations and engage in meaningful negotiations. Furthermore, Pakistan calls upon influential organizations such as the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to lead efforts in securing a just resolution to the conflict. Global powers, particularly those with significant influence over Israel, must use their leverage to ensure compliance with international norms and a commitment to peace. As Pakistan joins the chorus of nations calling for immediate de-escalation, it also highlights the broader implications of this crisis. Stability in the Middle East is intrinsically linked to global peace and security. Left unaddressed, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will continue to fuel extremism, exacerbate humanitarian crises, and undermine efforts toward international stability. The spillover effects of the conflict, including rising tensions in Lebanon and the risk of broader regional instability, necessitate a unified and holistic approach. Pakistan has urged world leaders to recognize these broader ramifications and act decisively to prevent further escalation. Echoing Jean-Noel Barrot’s sentiments, Pakistan believes that the time for global solidarity is now. The world must unite to uphold the principles of justice, human rights, and dignity. Only through collective action can we pave the way for a peaceful and equitable future for the people of Palestine and the region as a whole. The situation in Gaza is not just a Palestinian tragedy but a global failure to protect basic human rights and uphold justice. Pakistan’s call for accountability, dialogue, and humanitarian intervention is a reminder that peace is possible but requires collective effort. The international community must rise to the occasion, bridging differences and taking bold steps to ensure that the Palestinian people can live in dignity, freedom, and security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc6sEyd00HM-dhVaL_UTFh6	2024-11-21T08:58:03-08:00	
ASEAN’s Elusive Code Of Conduct For The South China Sea – Analysi...	By Jaime Naval ASEAN’s involvement in the South China Sea dispute began informally and incrementally. As Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, China and Taiwan firmed up their territorial claims, the dispute raised concerns from with and outside the region. From 1990 to 2002, Indonesia, with funding from Canada, hosted a series of Workshops on managing potential conflict in the South China Sea. Although dubbed a non-official activity to which the participants came in their ‘individual, private capacity’, the workshops, in the words of former ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino, had ‘an ASEAN aura’ to them. ASEAN cannot evade the issue as four of its members are involved in the dispute. The late 1980s witnessed China’s growing assertiveness. Sixty-four Vietnamese sailors died when they clashed with Chinese forces in the Spratly Islands in 1988. In February 1992, China passed its Law on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, which claimed sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. In July 1992, in the face of heightened tension, ASEAN issued its Declaration on the South China Sea — underscoring the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the area. In March 1995, impelled by the discovery of Chinese structures surreptitiously constructed on Mischief Reef — which China argued were intended to provide refuge and support for fishermen operating in the region — ASEAN issued its Statement on Recent Developments in the South China Sea. It again stressed the need to maintain peace and stability in the region through peaceful resolution of disputes and adherence to international law, particularly, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Over time, it became apparent that China’s actions were part of a broader effort to assert territorial claims over the South China Sea, which eventually led to the construction of military facilities on the reef in the 2010s. In earlier ASEAN–China exchanges, the South China Sea was reputedly treated as an after-dinner topic. But over time, as the dialogues gained traction, it became a central item in open discussions. Guarded optimism swept the region in late 2002 when ASEAN and China signed a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. It was a watershed document that mediated the dissonant and dangerous dynamics of the claimant states. The declaration was a dramatic departure from the assertiveness of the South China Sea dispute’s protagonists. Despite lingering distrust, it brought to the fore the possibility of cooperation among the claimants and proved ASEAN’s ability to forge a unified position on a complex, region-wide issue of strategic importance. It also demonstrated how China can be persuaded to recalibrate its position. The declaration was expected to pave the way for a successor agreement — the code of conduct, which was meant to preclude further escalation of the dispute. But its long absence has emboldened claimants to carry out expansion, fortification, coercion and even environmental degradation in the area. The overlapping claims are in contest in the South China Sea against the backdrop of a geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. Even as ASEAN and China strive to find common ground to craft a code of conduct, it would be foolhardy to drive out the United States and other extra-regional stakeholders, because they have their own strategic stakes in the South China Sea. The asymmetrical distances that ASEAN members maintain with the major powers translate into variations in their respective positions towards the South China Sea dispute. Strong disagreements on how to respond to China’s actions following the Scarborough Shoal standoff prevented ASEAN from issuing a joint statement in its 2012 ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. Cambodia, then Chair of ASEAN and a close partner of China, sought to exclude the matter from the joint communique, drawing livid reactions from concerned ASEAN members. It is thus not surprising that ASEAN has not issued any official statement referring to the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Even as the Court invalidated China’s expansive nine-dash line claim, the prevailing circumstances deterred the group from coming out with a formal, unified position. After more than two decades, several impediments to the code of conduct remain. Defining the geographical scope of the code is both fundamental and contentious. China wants the scope limited to areas where it does not have complete control, while the Philippines and Vietnam, seek inclusion of all disputed maritime features. As China claims nearly 90 per cent of the South China Sea, it makes sense for the code of conduct to include overlaps. China also seeks a flexible, non-binding code, while ASEAN wants a code that is legally binding. Having clear rules and mechanisms encourages compliance and accountability. Without this, the code of conduct would likely become an impotent document. Prohibiting military activities in the South China Sea is salient to preventing untoward incidents and a central purpose of the code of conduct. Limiting installation of military infrastructure, weapons deployment and military exercises would be expected to reduce the possibility of violent engagements. For the Philippines and perhaps Vietnam, the involvement of external powers, such as the United States, translates into having a necessary counterweight to China. China insists on disallowing external parties to engage in security partnerships or exercises with regional states. ASEAN stresses that freedom of navigation and overflight be preserved in accordance with UNCLOS, which guarantees the right of passage for all states through international waters. China also vows adherence to these rules, but in practice it pushes back on freedom of navigation operations by rival outside powers. Despite their professed commitment to finalising a code of conduct — including their latest 2026 deadline — ASEAN’s and China’s efforts are moving at a slow pace. Renewed or intensified military activity in the South China Sea undermines every avowal to peaceful dispute settlement. China evidently benefits from the status quo as it indurates and stretches its military presence in the area. But ASEAN cannot afford to be oblivious as the disputed waters constantly and ominously change.

BBC’s Ability To Facilitate Debate In Vietnam Hindered By Media C...	By Thanh Giang Nguyen This Perspective argues that Vietnam’s domestic campaign of media control, launched in 2017 has exerted a negative impact on the BBC World Service’s ability to report and engage with the Vietnamese public on social media. The article consists of four parts: The contextual background for the BBC’s engagement with Vietnam in pursuit of its mission of impartiality from 2000 to 2019. The negative impact of media control in Vietnam affecting BBC’s ability to engage with the Vietnamese public on social media between 2017 and 2022. A data analysis of the participation at the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable on YouTube that highlights the decreasing number of interviewees from Vietnam in 161 political episodes between 2014 to 2022. A comparative study with VOA and the implications of restricted access to Vietnam for all Western broadcasters serving Vietnam. The key findings are built around the locations of the people who participated in 161 political episodes of BBC Vietnamese Roundtable discussions about Vietnamese politics, out of all 356 broadcasts that also included discussions about other topics (social issues, health, politics etc.) from 2014 to 2022.[1] The author collected this set of data to determine whether the participants were located in Vietnam or abroad, as the level of intervention by the Vietnamese state influences the ability of interviewees to participate in political discussions. Specifically, individuals in Vietnam may face police actions such as detention or internet restrictions, and this discourages them from joining the Roundtable on social media. The findings are examined against the backdrop of regulatory changes in Vietnam, in order to evaluate how restrictions implemented between 2017 and 2019 impacted the number of individuals in the country willing to engage with the BBC on politically sensitive topics.[2] A short comparative study of 10 similar roundtable discussions on the YouTube channel of VOA Vietnamese in the US from this year (2024) will be conducted to broaden the findings about Vietnamese censorship’s impingement beyond the BBC to include other Western broadcasters for Vietnam in the last few years.[3] THE BBC AND VIETNAM: A STORY OF INCONGRUENT ENGAGEMENT The history of the BBC World Service, founded in 1932 as an international broadcaster of the British Broadcasting Corporation, has been shaped 'by global events and the UK’s changing relationship with the wider world'.[4] Similarly, the BBC Vietnamese programme, established in 1952, was perceived in Hanoi during the Cold War as a voice from the other side of the Iron Curtain. During the Vietnam War (1954-1975) BBC Vietnamese was even seen as 'an enemy radio' (đài địch) by communist propaganda. Such a perception is still being propagated by the military and security forces in Vietnam today.[5] The post-war unified Vietnam imposed a decade-long ban on all BBC reporters and jammed the BBC’s radio on shortwave frequencies for Vietnam, only allowing BBC Vietnamese Service’s Editor Judy Stowe to visit Vietnam in 1984.[6] Compared to China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and even Myanmar, Vietnam’s relationship with the BBC made it an outlier in that the country did not allow the BBC to have a local office. This policy of limiting BBC’s access to Vietnam shows a lack of mutual understanding between the BBC and the Vietnamese government about the role of the media. In other words, the World Service’s mission to provide 'trusted, accurate, impartial and independent news'[7] was not compatible with Vietnam’s definition of media in the Press Law (2016) as a tool to 'propagandise and disseminate the policies of the Communist Party, policies and laws of the State'.[8] The Law requires all publishing outlets to obtain official permits for disseminating news content and authorises the government to screen works prior to publication and stop publication of any content deemed objectionable or harmful to national security.[9] The reforms initiated in the late 1980s brought a change to Vietnam’s media environment. Since 2000, a new media strategy not only opened the country to foreign media, including the BBC, but also envisaged international integration of Vietnam into the world by combining three strategic objectives of 'security, development and influence'. The government media, e.g. Voice of Vietnam (VOV) and Vietnam Television (VTV), began to reach out to the BBC to gain access to modern technology and educational materials while the web blocking of the BBC’s content which is to prevent news stories deemed 'objectionable' from entering Vietnam’s cyberspace, would continue in a two-prong approach, consisting of 'collaboration and the struggle' with foreign powers.[10]0 In 2012, BBC Media Action, a department of the World Service in charge of training and collaboration was able to launch a communications project in Vietnam to help VOV 'better communicate the climate change issue to the community'.[11]1 The opening-up also saw three BBC News correspondents (Owen Bennett-Jones, Claire Arthur and Bill Hayton) being granted a reporting visa between 2000 and 2007 and to be based in Hanoi. The London-based BBC Vietnamese journalists were also permitted to visit their home country for reporting. However, despite this opening-up, the Vietnamese government continued with its cautious stance towards foreign media. Both British and Vietnamese reporters who had access to Vietnamese news sources and enjoyed direct engagement with the Vietnamese public were closely monitored by the Foreign Ministry’s Press Department and interviews with Vietnamese people needed to be pre-approved.[12] Stepping out of line would immediately result in the permit being revoked, as in the case of Bill Hayton who had his reporting visa shortened in 2007 because of a report about Vietnamese dissidents.[13] Since 2011, BBC Vietnam closed the radio programme to continue the news service on a web site, and then began to expand also on social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube). However, BBC’s online presence both in English and Vietnamese, has been blocked from time to time, prompting the corporation to find ways to keep the engagement going not only with government officials but also with the wider public in Vietnam. THE ROUNDTABLE: AN IMPACT THROUGH ENGAGEMENT Intensive efforts by the Vietnamese government to block BBC’s online content in Vietnam in the mid-2010s led to several initiatives by BBC World Service, including collaboration with tech companies, to circumvent the Vietnamese firewall.[14] The most crucial decision was to launch a direct regular broadcast on social media for Vietnam in 2014, produced especially for YouTube live discussions on the online address alongside the normal online news service of bbcvietnamese.com web page which was blocked from time to time.[15] The aim was to maximise accessibility on social platforms to fulfil BBC’s mission to engage with the audience without interference. In the next 6 years (2014-2021), the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable, modelled on BBC HARDtalk, a news-focused, moderated debate on British television, brought together hundreds of opinion makers, politicians, academics, and civil society activists from Vietnam and around the world. The diversity of voices and the live comments from the audience made it a success, bringing 143.8 million views to the BBC and 31.9 million hours of watch time between 2014 and 2021, according to data from YouTube Studio, with the majority being from Vietnam.[16] On many occasions, people with opposing viewpoints have debated and argued about Vietnamese politics, a phenomenon unseen after decades of ideological conflict and division among the Vietnamese. For example, the discussion broadcast on 1 May 2020 between Dr Bui Quynh Hoa, the daughter of Colonel Bui Van Tung who commanded a Northern Vietnamese tank unit that crashed through the gates of the former Republic of South Vietnam’s presidential palace in Saigon on 30 April 1975, and professor Nguyen Manh Hung, a US-based scholar and senior official in the South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War, about the need to accept the past for the sake of national reconciliation, received over 1.3m views on YouTube. Of note, a programme such as this by the BBC Vietnamese team was a brave attempt to tackle the longtime issue of the North-South divide, a topic severely censored in Vietnam because Hanoi still sees any symbol of the Republic of South Vietnam which surrendered in 1975 as a form of sedition, and still denies people who had ever served that regime access to state media in Vietnam.[17] The popularity of the Roundtable drew attention from the government, and a number of programmes in 2021 were denounced by the state media for 'distorting the truth about the country', and some of the moderators had to face cyber harassment.[18] But the fact that most participants were Vietnamese citizens, including many academics and government officials without any association to the former South Vietnamese regime, took away the usual argument of Vietnam’s state propaganda that critical voices were 'remnants of the hostile forces who refused to accept the defeat' in the Vietnam War which ended in 1975.[19] The success of the broadcast was made possible by a pluralism in political views, the immediacy of social media networks and its delivery in the neutral balanced language. Nevertheless, it soon became the subject of censorship. This was especially the case during the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnam (2020-21) when wide campaigns were undertaken to curtail public discussions in cyberspace, according to rights groups.[20] INTENSIFYING OF CENSORSHIP AND THE END OF PUBLIC DEBATES A quantitative review of 165 guest speakers and the frequency they were participating in 161 political episodes (several people appeared repeatedly in many episodes) together with the information about their locations as announced at the beginning of each broadcast,[21] reveals the following: YearParticipation from VietnamOutside VietnamTotal Episodes2014401201547422820167023242017553324201858292920193014182020402323202127913Table 1 (source: BBC Vietnamese YouTube) While the year 2014 had only one episode in November as the first in the series of political discussions, it is notable that that particularepisode had all 4 participants from Vietnam. Episodes in 2016 had the largest number of participants from Vietnam, with 52.8% representation. The year 2019 was a turning point which saw a significant drop in participants from Vietnam down to 30, with 14 from overseas. This is the time when both the new Press Law (enacted in 2016 to take full effect from 2017), and the Cybersecurity Law (effective from 01 January 2019) began to impact the Vietnamese media landscape. In the following years, media control targeting dissidents worked in tandem with heightened cyberspace restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2021). Throughout 2020 and 2021, the number of participants from Vietnam joining the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable decreased to an unsustainable level. In 2021, only 27 people from Vietnam, the lowest ever, and 9 from overseas (75% vs 25%) joined the 13 episodes of political discussions, with the last recording taking place in July of that year. In terms of audience attraction, a key metric for any media organisation in the world, the YouTube data gathered here (Figure 1) tells a story of decline. Since all recordings remain on YouTube, some of them still generate so-called ‘delayed watch time’ when people revisit a popular programme many months after it was aired. Hence, some of the visits and watch time in hours were recorded from 1 June 2008 well into 19 August 2024, but the YouTube Studio graphic here indicate that the peak of the Roundtable was between 2016 and 2020. The ending of political discussions on the BBC Vietnamese Roundtable in 2021 also meant that the regular inflow of audience to the BBC, built up over six years, stopped. In other words, millions of visits from Vietnam who spent 31.9 million hours to engage with the BBC on the free channel of YouTube ceased, a huge loss in terms of market share and direct audience engagement. Figure 1: Data set: YouTube Studio’s Analytics of BBC Vietnamese Roundtables The heightened intensity of YouTube broadcasts and participatory presence between 2014 and 2018 can be explained by the favourable media environment and a change in official attitude towards the BBC in Vietnam under the government of reform-oriented Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung (2006-2016). A chronological record of heightened BBC’s engagement with Vietnam’s leadership is presented as follows: 2007: Former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet gave an interview to BBC Vietnamese in Ho Chi Minh City and used the BBC platform to call for national unity and political reform.[22] 2008: Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung gave a televised interview to BBC World TV during his visit to London.[23] 2009: Former Deputy President Mrs Nguyen Thi Binh received a BBC Vietnamese reporter in Hanoi and gave a candid interview about the Vietnam War and national reconciliation.[24] 2012 and 2015: Vietnamese officials, including Vice-Minister of Defence Nguyen Chi Vinh gave interviews to BBC Vietnamese reporters in Vietnam and Singapore.[25] July 2019: A BBC Vietnamese reporter successfully conducted an interview with Finance Minister Dinh Tien Dung, a member of the Politburo, in London rather than Vietnam. This event signifies the end of the BBC’s favourable period in Vietnam and highlights a remarkable shift in regulatory measures governing foreign media operations in the country.[26] It is noteworthy that the appreciation of the BBC by the government of Vietnam and the interaction with several leaders at that time helped remove the Cold War stigma of 'the BBC as a voice from the opposite side' and facilitated the participation of middle-ranking officials, academics and technocrats from the public sector, most of whom were members of the Communist Party, in the Roundtable. With the resignation of PM Nguyen Tan Dung at the 12th Congress of the CPV in early 2016, Vietnamese politics slowly turned back towards Leninism and state controls. The trend continued into 2021 when the Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong was re-elected to serve a third term, according to observers.[27] International observers noticed an emerging paradigm affecting many areas of social life and economic participation of foreign companies including a stricter visa regime for foreign workers (2020), cuts to the length of tourist visas in 2021, and the introduction of Decree 58 by the government (2022) to scrutinise foreign non-governmental organisations operating in Vietnam. In the field of media control, the new measures to stifle public discussion in Vietnam were developing in two stages with each of them affecting the BBC in unique ways: First, Decree 9, issued in February 2017 by the new government of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc prohibited all civil servants and employees of government agencies from speaking to the media without prior authorisation, and forbade Vietnamese journalists from sharing news stories on social media.[28] The effect of the ban on speech in the public sector has been far-reaching and has reduced the number of regular contributors from the public sector in the BBC’s discussions. The latter were, inter alia, former chairman of Vietnam Parliament’s Education Committee Nguyen Minh Thuyet, former Director of the Vietnamese government’s Border Commission Tran Cong Truc (both holding the rank of a minister), former ambassador Dinh Hoang Thang, diplomat Tran Viet Thai, historian Vu Minh Giang and many others who were once regular participants in the Roundtable in the previous period. Then,the Cybersecurity Law (2018) further limited the number of participants from the non-state sector.[29] Worse, many civil society activists and independent journalists were subjected to direct censorship, according to human rights groups.[30] More than 10 of the regular participants of the BBC’s broadcast were among activists and bloggers detained and charged in Vietnam between 2016 and 2022 for 'abusing freedom of speech' or more often, for 'anti-state propaganda' by speaking publicly on social media.[31] Others chose self-imposed exile or kept silent to avoid persecution. In less-known cases, provincial newspapers in Vietnam publicly denounced local activists and bloggers until they stopped using social media to challenge the government on policies or to expose corruption cases. In the court papers against blogger Pham Doan Trang, one of the charges against her was 'the interviews given to BBC Vietnamese and Radio Free Asia'.[32] LIMITATIONS ON POLITICAL DEBATE IN VIETNAM AND THE CONSEQUENCES By 2021, censorship online and offline – often in the form of harsh sentences meted out to online critics – had damaging ramifications for BBC Vietnamese Roundtable output, reducing the number of people from Vietnam brave enough to continue participating to less than 10 people. The latter included two well-known dissidents, Mr Nguyen Huu Vinh and Mr Nguyen Quang A, and two outspoken academics, Pham Quy Tho and Hoang Ngoc Giao. Together with a few retired historians and journalists in Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese journalists, they participated in the last 13 political discussions of the Roundtable in 2021.[33] In response to this new situation – with a lack of speakers able and willing to discuss Vietnamese politics – together with the departure of four staff members experienced in moderating the Roundtable, BBC Vietnamese had to close the Roundtable in 2022 and instead reinvest in a different livestreaming podcast on social and youth-related topics, from its Bangkok bureau. The last BBC Vietnamese interview conducted in Vietnam was in January 2023 and, since then, no team member has been able to gain accreditation to report from the country. Moreover, the public space in Vietnam has been so thoroughly sanitised that a public discussion, if organised to be independent from state intervention, is highly likely to have just voices from outside of Vietnam. The limitation on the ability to organise discussions in Vietnam is also evident in the case of the VOA Vietnamese YouTube debate about Vietnamese politics. A review of 10 episodes between 18 January and 10 August 2024 on the VOA Vietnamese YouTube channel reveals a pattern about the locations of participants or guest speakers similar to that for the BBC Vietnamese discussion in the recent past: DateLocationTotal numberVietnam guest speakersOverseas guests10 Aug 2024All speakers in USA40403 Aug 2024Vietnam, USA, Cambodia41321 May 2024Vietnam, UK, USA41309 May 2024Vietnam, US, Germany41304 April 2024Vietnam, Germany, USA41318 Jan 2024Vietnam, USA422Table 2 (source: VOA Vietnamese YouTube) The data not only indicate that the geographical location of the participants favours overseas voices, often at a ratio of 3 to 1. In addition, their personal profiles, and thus their political viewpoints are less diverse compared to those taking part in the BBC’s YouTube programme during its peak, prior to 2019. In sum, all participants in this VOA Vietnamese discussion programme were political dissidents, with no one representing the view of the Vietnamese government. Moreover, the only regular guest speaker from Vietnam in 4 out of 6 VOA Vietnamese recordings was dissident lawyer Le Quoc Quan while several programmes in the same series had the same, returning guest speakers from the US, Germany and the UK.[34] At the time of writing, the issue of Vietnamese citizens being pressurised and prevented from giving interviews to overseas-based media has received international attention. In September 2024, Mary Lawlor, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders raised the case of Mr Nguyen Quang A, a Hanoi-based intellectual dissident who had been interrogated multiple times by the police in Vietnam for 'giving interviews on social media', calling on Vietnam to protect his human rights.[35] It is worth noting that Mr. Quang A was a regular guest on the BBC Roundtable. Since its closure, he has frequently appeared on the Vietnamese programmes of other international broadcasters, including the new YouTube discussion series by VOA mentioned earlier. CONCLUSION An increasingly tight media censorship by Vietnam in the last 5 years both internally and externally has had a far-reaching negative impact on the operation of the BBC Vietnamese language service. The impact on BBC Vietnamese Service is two-fold. Firstly, the continuation of a harsh media regulatory regime and the lack of direct access to Vietnam have, in effect turned it into one of many language services in the BBC World Service 'working in exile', a new phenomenon caused by increasing repression against free media around the world.[36] In this specific context concerning the operation of the BBC, Vietnam’s media restrictions are on a par with Iran, China and Russia. Secondly, to uphold the principle of impartiality, the only option left to these journalists is to use indirect quotes reflecting the views and opinions of the Vietnamese government and top leaders as shown in state media outlets. The Service can now hardly organise an open debate about Vietnamese politics with a variety of views and voices from Vietnam, as envisaged by the BBC Charter. For the public in Vietnam, the pervasive and stringent media censorship has significantly restricted civic space, preventing the expression of diverse viewpoints and limiting the ability to address common concerns in a timely and responsible manner. With Decree 53 (2022) issued specifically to interpret the Cyber Security Law in the light of national defence, and new decrees in 2023 effectively banning livestreaming by individuals in Vietnam except for entertainment, sales and commercial advertising, more state control over public speech is in place.[37] One of the implications of this new stringent regime has been that the vacuum has gradually been filled by anti-government YouTube broadcasts made by overseas influencers attacking top leaders of Vietnam with numerous unsubstantiated corruption accusations and in very defamatory language.[38] Their popularity indicates that the stringent regulations have been counterproductive to their purpose of bringing people to the government’s side. Instead, they have led to further polarization of public opinion in Vietnamese-language media environment. For the government of Vietnam, blocking the BBC and closing space for domestic debate has not only deprived its decision-making agencies of a useful channel for constructive feedback, one needed to rectify their policy-related errors, but also contradicts the joint declaration on the UK-Vietnamese strategic partnership made in 2020 wherein both sides had pledged to 'promote greater access to each other’s media organisations'.[39] Looking forward, one could argue that until both sides reach convergent perspectives on the role of the media, Vietnam’s hindrance to the work of British media, especially the BBC in reporting about Vietnam and engaging with the public in that country, will continue.

On Climate, Will Trump Have It All His Own Way? – Analysis	By Dhesigen Naidoo Donald Trump’s comments during his 2024 campaign trail, together with his actions during his first presidency, suggest doom and gloom for the global climate agenda – and a severe retardation of climate action during his upcoming second term. But new factors determine the global landscape compared to 2016, offering a more nuanced set of possibilities for climate action. Trump announced the United States’ (US) withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2017. The official exit came in November 2020, just before the end of his first term. Although President Joe Biden’s administration soon reversed the departure, some damage was done. A second withdrawal could be devastating. Trump also appointed climate change sceptics to key positions within the US administration and beyond. He picked Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency head and nominated David Malpass – famous for denying the scientific consensus on the link between fossil fuels and global warming – as president of the World Bank. The bank is a key body expected to support an international movement to a lower carbon economy. In 2020, the Brookings Institution counted 74 actions of Trump’s administration that weakened environmental protection in the US, driven largely by the America First Energy Plan. This was primarily a package to rescue and empower the US fossil fuel value chain. Measures included reopening coal mines, removing oil exploration and drilling restrictions, and reducing climate and environmental regulations. Will Trump’s second presidency – bolstered with a suite of gains he didn’t have before – deliver more of the same? His first gain was winning the popular vote and the electoral college vote. Second, the Presidency, Senate and Congress are all under Republican control. This creates a super-highway for legislation, policy and budget approvals that are not necessarily aligned with global sustainability. In 2020, Brookings counted 74 actions of Trump’s administration that weakened US environmental protections The third gain is that preparation for this Republican presidency has been high. In addition to the role of Trump’s team and conservative think tanks, there is also Project 2025, which lists as a priority ‘unleash[ing] American energy production to reduce energy prices.’ Project 2025 policy documents call for ending research funding on climate change, and dismantling or downsizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency. These agencies have become increasingly prominent as the US experiences high levels of climate-related disasters. Damaging possibilities include reversing official policy to decarbonise America, decreasing public investments in climate change research, balkanising or reducing the size of federal and other institutions managing climate impacts, and withdrawing from related multilateral and other commitments. If launched, the US anti-climate juggernaut, driven by its geopolitical influence and economic power, might push the world towards catastrophic climate scenarios. The US will also reduce foreign aid and assistance programmes related to climate change, with Africa as a potential victim. But there are important mitigating factors. First, the domestic dividends associated with the US’ green investments are real. The flagbearer is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its US$370 billion boost for investment in green technology. In the short term, most benefits from the IRA are being accrued to Republicans. Clean energy investments in Republican congressional districts stand at US$268.5 billion, compared to US$77.4 billion in Democrat-controlled districts. Most IRA benefits – with its US$370 billion boost for green tech investments – accrued to Republicans The US Treasury indicated in its March 2024 report that the projected benefit from the IRA would be US$5 trillion by 2050, as a combination of global economic benefits, decreased pollution and an increase in domestic health and productivity. The projected benefit for 2024 alone is estimated at US$137 million. Forbes says that by 2030, the IRA could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels. It could create 1.3 million jobs and avoid 4 500 premature deaths annually by 2030. The second mitigating factor is that the US has had a plethora of weather- and climate-related disasters that have been costly in terms of the economy, threats to the social fabric, and loss of life. Official data indicates that since 1980, these disasters have resulted in 16 768 deaths and cost the economy US$2.785 trillion. Third, the weight of decarbonisation in the global tussle for geopolitical superiority is significant. Europe has already pegged its future economic security in the European Green Deal. The US’ biggest economic competitor is China, which has invested extensively in renewable energy and electric vehicles. China’s green growth has been a major boost to its ascendency economically. Both overt and covert carbon-based trade barriers are already being developed at pace. The most prominent is the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The weight of decarbonisation in the global tussle for geopolitical superiority is significant The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2024 states that faster expansion of clean energy is key to reducing fragilities associated with geopolitical risk. The report also points to a 2030 tipping point, when electricity production from low-emission sources will overtake fossil fuels. Then there is the Elon Musk factor. A big Trump supporter and clearly a person of influence around the president-elect, Musk is an electric vehicle pioneer. Tesla is the world’s largest electric car company, with more than 10 times larger market capitalisation than its closest competitor. Musk is also a major global player in battery technology and a strong proponent of low-carbon energy solutions. Could this soften Trump’s position on fossil fuels? The likely scenario is that the beginning of the 47th US administration will see big gestures in line with the America First Energy, pro-fossil fuel doctrine. This may include initiating a second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Early push-back on environmental regulations is almost certain. Equally likely is a subsequent shift to a nuanced narrative highlighting the need for decarbonisation as renewable energy and low-carbon industrialisation become essential in global economic competition – a change that can’t come soon enough.

The History And Impact Of Japan’s Loans To China – Analysis	By Xia Ri 1979 was a critical year for the economic, political, and diplomatic development between China and Japan. During his visit to China, then-Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ōhira explicitly stated that Japan would support China's reform and opening-up efforts. Subsequently, Japan formally began providing government development loans to China, primarily in yen. In December 2007, China and Japan signed the yen loan agreement, and 28 years later, the Japanese government officially announced that it would cease the loans to China starting in 2008. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that yen loans played a significant role in China's reform and opening-up, and in advancing China's socialist modernization. However, the importance of yen loans is clearly underestimated in China, hence the need for it to be re-examined and recognized. In its entire process, Japan provided loans to China in batches, with the initial scale rapidly increasing, peaking in 2000, then sharply decreasing. Overall, yen loans show the five characteristics of high amounts, large increases, low interest rates, long repayment periods, and high cooperation. The first three batches of yen loans saw a significant increase in scale. The first batch (1979-1983) amounted to JPY 330.9 billion, with an interest rate of 3% and a 30-year repayment period, including a 10-year grace period. The second batch (1984-1989) was announced during Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to China in 1984, with a loan of JPY 470 billion, an interest rate ranging from 3% to 5%, and the same 30-year repayment period, including a 10-year grace period. The third batch (1990-1995), announced during Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru's visit in 1988, involved JPY 810 billion, a 2.5% interest rate, and a 30-year repayment period, also with a 10-year grace period. Secondly, after the fourth batch of yen loans, the scale sharply declined after reaching its peak. The fourth batch of loans was divided into two stages: JPY 580 billion for the 1996-1998 period and JPY 390 billion for the 1999-2000 period, totaling approximately JPY 970 billion. The annual interest rate ranged from 0.75% to 2.3%, with a repayment period of 30 years, including a 10-year grace period. By 2000, yen loans peaked at JPY 2.14299 trillion, which was about three times the amount of the first batch. However, after 2001, the loan amount significantly decreased, reaching its lowest point by 2007 at only JPY 46.302 billion, a reduction of about 78.4% compared to 2000. Finally, there were also industry-specific loans. In 1988 and 1994, the Japanese government provided China with two capital recycling yen loans, amounting to JPY 100 billion and JPY 40 billion, respectively. These loans were mainly used for industries such as textiles, electromechanical, light industry production, and raw materials for export. The development of these sectors supported China's efforts to expand exports and generate foreign exchange. In October 2000, Japan also provided China a special yen loan with a 40-year repayment term, with a 10-year grace period, and an interest rate of only 0.95%, totaling JPY 17.202 billion. These yen loans played a significant role in China's reform and opening-up, driving the rapid development of the Chinese economy. This impact is reflected in the following three areas: First, they opened the door for China to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy. In June 1979, the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law was passed, signaling China's official abandonment of its 1960s policy of rejecting foreign investment. This marked a shift towards encouraging foreign capital. In 1978, China's foreign exchange reserves were only USD 167 million. In 1979, China and Japan signed the first loan agreement, which was the earliest and largest foreign government loan received by China since the reform and opening-up began. Japan was the first country to offer government loans to China, thus opening the door for China to introduce foreign capital to develop its economy. To facilitate this loan, the Japanese government proposed and convinced other Western countries and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to classify China as a 'developing country' and include it in the list of countries eligible for assistance from developed nations. This was very helpful for China in securing funding and development aid from international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, thus accelerating China's economic development and integration into the global economic system. Japan was also the largest donor of government development assistance to China, with the total loan agreement amount accounting for over 60% of all foreign government loans to China. Among the 24 countries and regional financial institutions that provided government loans to China, Japan's loans were the largest. China was the third-largest recipient of Japan's foreign aid, following Indonesia and Vietnam. In 2006, Japan's Ambassador to China, Keiji Ide, noted that, in terms of U.S. dollars, Japan's aid to China amounts to USD 144.1 billion, exceeding the total aid from Germany (USD 39.6 billion), France (USD 13.4 billion), and the UK (USD 6.6 billion) combined. Second, the loans promoted China's infrastructure and economic development plans through valuable long-term investment funds, thereby reducing financing costs for construction. The multi-year decision approach to loans aligned with China's five-year economic plans, effectively advancing infrastructure development in areas such as resources, energy, transportation, and communications. According to data from Japan-China Economic Cooperation, the share of yen loans in China's fixed asset investment increased from 1.54% in 1985 to 10.41% in 1992. Through joint efforts between the two countries, a number of large-scale, long-term, technologically advanced, and capital-intensive infrastructure projects were completed across China's provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. By the end of 1995, the major construction projects included the expansion of the Beijing-Qinhuangdao railway, Qinhuangdao Port expansion, Lianyungang Port expansion, Qingdao Port expansion, the Tianshengqiao hydropower project, the Datong-Qinhuangdao railway construction, Beijing subway construction, Beijing water supply improvement projects, urban gas improvement projects, export base construction projects, Hainan Island development, telephone network expansion in nine provinces and cities, Beijing Capital Airport development, the Xi'an-Ankang railway project, and numerous city infrastructure projects in railways, gas, water supply, electricity, and communications. For instance, between 1991 and 1995, the Tianshengqiao Hydroelectric Project utilized JPY 4.367 billion in loans to build a 1,200 MW dam-style hydroelectric power station, extend 984 kilometers of transmission lines, and support China's eighth Five-Year Plan and the West-to-East Gas Pipeline Project. Furthermore, since Japan launched the transformative economic cooperation plan for China in 2001, yen loans have supported national regional strategies such as the plans for developing the western and central parts of the country. These loans greatly facilitated development in the recipient areas in sectors such as education, healthcare, and the environment, including projects like the Heihe-Beian highway in Heilongjiang, local road development in Gansu, and afforestation plans in Inner Mongolia. Third, it accelerated the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. After the 1980s, the two countries' economic and trade relations evolved from simple import-export trade to comprehensive economic cooperation, which included bilateral trade, the change of Japan's government development aid policy to China, direct investment, and intergovernmental financial cooperation. During this decade, leveraging Japan's government-to-government financial cooperation with China, bilateral trade between the two countries grew from around USD 10 billion in 1981 to USD 20.282 billion in 1991, an increase of over 100%. During this period, trade between the two nations experienced sustained and rapid development overall. Moreover, direct investment from both countries also saw a significant rise, leading to the first surge of private Japanese investment in China. According to data, between 1979 and 1985, the investment amounted to USD 1.23 billion; from 1986 to 1990, total investment reached USD 1.29 billion. Although these investment surges were mainly focused on China's Special Economic Zones and were smaller in scale compared to later investments, they were crucial in opening up direct private investment between the two countries and played a significant role in developing China-Japan economic and trade relations. Later, due to political factors and the Asian financial crisis, China-Japan trade experienced several setbacks. In 1990, bilateral trade declined significantly; from 1994 to 1996, growth slowed notably compared to previous years, and negative growth occurred in 1998. However, overall, China-Japan trade continued to rise, from USD 12.927 billion in 1990 to USD 66.167 billion in 1999. In the 21st century, the development of China-Japan economic and trade relations accelerated rapidly, showing characteristics such as mutual dependence, increasing deepening, a mutually beneficial structure becoming more evident. At the same time, Japan's increasing dependence on China surpassed China's dependence on Japan. This made an important contribution to China's economic development. Meanwhile, Japanese investment in China continued to grow. In 2002, Japanese investment in China remained high, with an agreement amount of USD 5.3 billion and an actual investment of USD 4.19 billion. By the end of 2002, the total agreed investment from Japan to China had reached USD 49.53 billion, with actual investment amounting to USD 36.34 billion. All in all, the 28 years of Japanese loans had a significant impact on China's reform and opening-up, opening the door for it to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy, promoting infrastructure and economic development plans, and accelerating the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. Therefore, a proper understanding of these loan aids is crucial for China to effectively manage and advance its relations with Japan. Final analysis conclusion: The 28 years of yen loans were characterized by high amounts, significant increases, low interest rates, long repayment periods, and high cooperation. They played a crucial role in China's reform and opening-up, opening the door for China to introduce foreign capital and develop its economy, promoting infrastructure and economic development plans, and accelerating the rapid development of China-Japan economic and trade relations. Therefore, the history and impact of yen loans need to be re-examined.

Will Gavin Newsom Become The New ‘Teflon’ Politician? – OpEd	By William L. Anderson When reality hit the Democratic Party and its ruling-class allies the day after the election, one Democrat must have been relieved: California governor Gavin Newsom. The Kamala Harris loss not only ends her political career—at least at the presidential level—but also clears the way for Newsom to pursue the White House himself. A Harris victory would have delayed Newsom’s quest for eight years, but now he can start laying the groundwork now for a run in 2028. Newsom will spend the next two years in office before becoming a full-time candidate, and, given the constitutional limit on two terms, the Republicans won’t have the advantage (or the weight) of incumbency and will likely present a candidate with less name recognition than Newsom possesses. The New York Times already has jumped in feet-first in its 'Style' section with a hagiographic portrayal of Newsom, hair gel and all. The writer breathlessly wrote: Last year, he debated Ron DeSantis on that network, landing rhetorical jabs like 'You’re nothing but a bully.' The appearances have burnished his reputation as someone who saunters into the conservative lion’s den and comes out with his slicked hair unruffled. His first post-election 'heroic' move was to call for a special session of the California legislature: ...to protect 'California values' in preparation for former President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Less than 36 hours after Trump’s resounding victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, the California governor — a prominent opponent of the former president during his first term — called to bolster the state’s legal resources with the aim of protecting reproductive healthcare, climate policies and immigrant communities in California. One might think that we are looking at something that is light years away, politically speaking, but in the world of presidential ambition, successful candidates spend years scheming to reach that office. John F. Kennedy’s father was planning the political careers of his sons long before they reached full adulthood, Ronald Reagan coveted the presidency more than 10 years before he was elected in 1980, and Jimmy Carter and his advisers quietly launched their quest long before the Watergate scandal gave him a major opening. In presidential politics, four years is tomorrow and no doubt Newsom and those surrounding him already are at work. However, as Harris has found out, what constitutes success in California politics might prove a liability elsewhere, and that is especially the case regarding the state’s draconian policies on energy and climate change. One imagines that most people believe California to be a weird and exotic place on the nation’s west coast that is an expensive place to live but has little relevance in their own lives. Sure, the state has stringent environmental laws, but the effects are limited to California, or one might think. However, California’s energy and climate policies affect nearly everyone in this country. The election of Donald Trump brings an opponent of California’s policies to the White House, where he is: …expected to try to blow up California’s climate policies, which have set the pace for the rest of the nation and the world. The state is requiring about three-quarters of new trucks sold there after 2035 to be zero emissions. And in a request that is pending, California wants permission from the Biden administration to enact one of the most ambitious climate rules of any nation: a ban on the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in the state after 2035. Both rules are far tougher than federal policy and could have influence beyond the United States, given California’s standing as the world’s fifth-largest economy. China and the European Union have already adopted parts of California’s car and truck tailpipe emissions reduction programs. The Democratic-controlled state legislature has also passed a first-in-the-nation law requiring major companies to disclose their greenhouse emissions. And it has strengthened the authority of local governments to shut down oil and gas projects in their communities. Next month, Californians will be asked to approve a ballot measure to create a $10 billion 'climate bond' to pay for climate and environmental projects. While the New York Times writes approvingly of California’s policies, in reality they will be disastrous for the rest of the country if put into place. In 2023, the California legislature passed a law aimed at outlawing all internal combustion engines in trucks within a decade, a law so draconian that 19 state attorneys general filed suit in federal court to block it. The impact this law would have on the trucking industry would be enormous, especially given how much freight is carried overland on trucks and how inadequate electric vehicles would be to carry it: Electric trucks suffer major disadvantages when compared to diesel trucks. Diesel trucks can travel about 1200 miles after filling the tank in 15 minutes. The range of electric trucks is about 150-330 miles and recharging may take hours, even on a high-speed charger. Electric truck cabs cost two to three times as much as diesel cabs, an incremental cost of as much as $300,000 per truck. Electric cabs also weigh about 10,000 pounds more than comparable diesel versions. This can reduce net freight carried by as much as 20 percent. Part of the problem is that California’s environmental standards often become the precursors to standards for the entire country, but thanks to the Jones Act, California policy has a disproportionate effect upon the lives of others. Because of California’s proximity to Asia (and especially China), it is a natural place for container ships coming from Asia to bring goods imported into the US, and at the present time, about 40 percent of all US imports come through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Because of the Jones Act, those foreign-owned ships cannot take goods to any other US port unless they stop at a foreign port that is some distance away. Thus, they cannot take some goods to California and then sail to the US east coast and take goods there. The effect of this law is that a huge amount of imported goods going elsewhere in the US must be transported by truck or rail through California, and given the strict regulations for transfer trucks, carrying goods through that state is very expensive. Given that the laws governing transfer trucks will be even more stringent, that only can raise costs—unless the Jones Act is repealed, which is highly unlikely, given its almost religious support by Democrats and labor unions, despite the hardships it causes. Because Newsom supports the draconian legislation regulating trucks in California, he also is playing a direct role in California being a transportation bottleneck for the rest of the country, a situation that will only become worse in the next four years. To writers from the New York Times, economic crises caused by things like environmental regulations simply don’t happen, or if they do, the fault lies with capitalism. However, if California can proceed with radical restrictions on transporting goods, there can be no spinning the inevitable results. They will mean higher prices, empty shelves, and more hardships for those who are not wealthy. Newsom’s policies will at least be partly to blame, but will voters connect the dots, especially since journalists won’t? Four decades ago, a former governor from California occupied the White House. Because the media and their governmental allies could not pin any scandals on Ronald Reagan, they derisively called him the 'Teflon President.' Given the fawning coverage that Newsom receives in the media, the fact that California has the nation’s highest poverty rates, ruinous environmental laws, and one of the nation’s highest net out-migration rates, one would think that the most prominent political architect of these woes would at least pay something akin to a political price. But think again. If there ever has been a 'Teflon' politician, it is Gavin Newsom. Be prepared to see numerous fawning pieces from mainstream media outlets that present him as a demigod.

Javier Milei’s Blueprint For DOGE: A Chainsaw For Bureaucracy – O...	By Daphne Posadas 'What is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.' That opening line set the tone for Javier Milei’s two-hour interview with Lex Fridman. In it, Argentina’s libertarian president reflected on the first few months of his administration following his historic electoral victory on November 19, 2023. Milei has been called many things, but his methods and philosophy thrive under scrutiny. In a free society, being questioned is both a challenge and an opportunity. What sets Milei apart is his ability to answer tough questions with logic, evidence, and, most importantly, results. His anarchist rhetoric is—as he said—rooted in a libertarianism that has an 'unrestricted respect for the life project of others based on the principle of non-aggression and in defense of the rights to life, liberty, and property,' a definition championed by Alberto Benegas Lynch, Jr., and that follows John Locke’s ideas. A Model Exported Milei’s reforms haven’t gone unnoticed in the U.S., especially after the announcement of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. In the interview, Milei highlighted how Argentina’s Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation, led by Federico Sturzenegger, is systematically dismantling protectionism and privilege by eliminating 1 to 5 economic restrictions daily. This approach is catching attention worldwide, as Musk and Ramaswamy have hinted at adapting this 'chainsaw' strategy. Ramaswamy recently posted on X: 'A reasonable formula to fix the U.S. government: Milei-style cuts, on steroids.' A reasonable formula to fix the U.S. government: Milei-style cuts, on steroids.— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) November 18, 2024 The Chainsaw Reforms If there’s one image that defined Milei’s 2023 campaign, it’s the chainsaw. He carried a real chainsaw to his rallies, chanting '¡Motosierra! ¡Motosierra!' (Spanish for 'chainsaw') as a symbol of his promise to slash Argentina’s bloated bureaucracy. When Milei took office, Argentina’s inflation was out of control, climbing at almost 1% per day. Fixing the fiscal deficit became his top priority, knowing nothing else would work without a solution on that front. In just a few months, he made drastic changes: cutting over 50,000 government jobs, shutting down more than half of the ministries, slashing regulations, and removing subsidies. The results? Inflation has dropped from 211% year over year in December 2023 to 107.4% in November 2024, according to the latest inflation data from INDEC. According to UFM Reform Watch’s Daniel Fernandez, Javier Milei’s government has now achieved 10 consecutive months of primary fiscal surplus: 'Between January and October 2024, the Argentine government accumulated a primary fiscal surplus equivalent to nearly 1.7% of GDP'—a remarkable turnaround. Milei: A Former Academic As a former economics professor, Milei excels at breaking down complex economic concepts. Early in the interview, he provided a roadmap for those interested in understanding Austrian economics with big references: Human Action by Ludwig von Mises and Principles of Economics by Carl Menger, two starting points for him. He also name-dropped other thinkers, including Murray Rothbard, Friedrich Hayek, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Jesús Huerta de Soto, Juan Ramón Rallo, Philipp Bagus, and Walter Block—a quick guide to both Anglo and Hispanic perspectives on libertarian thought. When Fridman dug deeper and asked about his economic philosophy, Milei replied: 'Ideally, anarcho-capitalist; in reality, minarchist.' This summarizes his pragmatic approach to reducing the state’s size through what he calls 'the largest structural reform in Argentina’s history' while being realistic about what’s possible. Here Milei also addressed criticism from some libertarians, saying they often fall for the 'nirvana fallacy'—expecting perfect solutions in an imperfect world. Key Takeaways There are two main takeaways from Milei’s interview with Fridman. First, Milei knows what he’s talking about. Too many politicians don’t really understand economics, but Milei clearly does. He doesn’t just memorize numbers; he explains the reasoning behind his decisions, and it makes sense. Second, market-driven reforms can deliver results. Contrary to popular belief or experts’ advice, these changes don’t require decades to show their impact. Will these reforms catch on all the way to the White House? Only time will tell. But for now, it’s clear that Milei’s approach is turning heads around the world. I highly recommend watching or listening to the full conversation. It’s an incredibly stimulating discussion, particularly for economics enthusiasts eager to see theory translated into real-world policy action.

Who Should Pay For Really Expensive Drugs? – OpEd	When is the last time you saw a news headline about cancer patients who died because they were unable to afford a drug that could have saved their lives? I bet you haven’t. One reason is that drug companies that make expensive drugs can’t afford the political backlash that would follow such a headline. Another reason is that large employers who provide health insurance can’t afford such a headline, either. Yet, despite the fact that Big Pharma and big business agree on the end result (people get the lifesaving drugs they need), they don’t always agree on who should bear the bulk of the cost. In fact, in the modern era there has been a continuing tug of war between the two that has been largely unreported. Enter the politicians to tilt the scale. A letter signed by a number of Democrats and Republicans in Congress supports a Biden administration proposed regulation that would remove many employer options. Instead of allowing normal market forces to play out, this regulation would allow drug companies to sell brand-name drugs at monopoly prices for virtually all patients with employer-provided health insurance. The result would be higher drug company profits and lower employee wages. Specialty Drugs The most expensive drugs are generally called 'specialty drugs.' These are primarily used to treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and genetic diseases. They can also cost thousands of dollars. For example, among the top ten most prescribed specialty drugs, the monthly expense ranges from $3,587 to $33,981. Including the treatment of HIV infection, only 5.9% of the US population uses a specialty drug. But those drugs now account for over 50% of total drug spending in the United States. Within the U.S., people with private health insurance tend to face very high out-of-pocket costs when it comes to specialty drugs. If a drug costs $2,000 a month, for example, an employee might have to pay the full cost for 3 or 4 months before reaching the deductible; then the employee’s health insurance takes over. For many people, this out-of-pocket cost may pose a significant barrier to obtaining the prescribed drug. Drug Companies To overcome that obstacle (at least in the short run), drug companies issue copay cards to use at a pharmacy to cover the initial cost. This gets patients started on the drugs their doctors say they need. Although it is not generally known, just about anyone starting out on an expensive drug regime can get copay cards for the first few months of treatment—regardless of income. (Remarkably, in issuing copay cards, drug companies are doing something that would be completely illegal if done by doctors and hospitals. If a doctor or hospital waived the patient’s out-of-pocket portion of the bill, they would be violating anti-kickback laws.) The drug companies’ second line of attack is the creation of Patient Assistance Programs. These are charitable enterprises that give financial assistance to people who are uninsured or underinsured. The amount of help generally depends on the patient’s income—with the goal of making the drug affordable. Large Employers In a free market for health insurance, a typical plan would leave the enrollee responsible for small expenses for which patient discretion is affordable and desirable, and have the health plan pay for large expenses that would otherwise be unaffordable. However, government regulation (which has become more onerous with the passage of time) forces employers to ignore the health condition of prospective employees. These regulations, along with the rising cost of health care, have induced employers to adopt health plans that turn traditional health insurance principles upside down. That means, for example, low out-of-pocket costs for primary care and high out-of-pocket costs for hospitalization. This is the type of plan that appeals to potential employees who are healthy and does not appeal to those who expect to need a lot of care. Drug coverage often fits this pattern. No employer wants to hire an employee whose family member needs a specialty drug. The employer could end up paying more in medical costs than in wages. Since it is illegal for the employer to ask about expected medical expenses at the point of hiring, the same end can be achieved by not covering the drug in the first place, or by covering it with a high deductible. This makes employment at the firm unattractive to anyone who needs the drug. The Tug of War We saw above how drug companies try to get private group health plans or health insurance to pay most of the cost of expensive drugs. Employers have been using strategies of their own. One straightforward approach is to not cover a specialty drug in their health plan or to cover it with high patient cost-sharing (which large, self-insured companies are allowed to do). When a doctor prescribes the drug, the employee is then directed to the drug company’s Patient Assistance Program (PAP) as someone who is not fully insured for the needed drug. Some advocacy companies actually specialize in helping the employee fill out the paperwork and navigate the byzantine PAP system. What happens if patients are rejected by the PAP, say, because their income is too high to qualify for financial assistance? Then the employer often makes a hardship exception and pays for the drug through its health plan. The congressional letter signers (noted above) want to put an end to these employer options. They want to force large employers to cover expensive drugs the way they cover other drugs—giving the drug companies a big win. And since employer health insurance benefits are ultimately paid for by lower employee wages, the drug company win would be an employee loss. There is no right or wrong solution when a monopoly seller clashes with buyers trying to avoid paying a monopoly price. That’s why government regulators should be held at bay and normal market forces should be allowed to play out.

Russia Now Has Two Million Homeless And Their Ranks Are Growing B...	Although the Russian government does not release any statistics on homelessness, the Shelter (Nochlezhka) organization, the oldest group in Russia devoted to helping the homeless, says there are now approximately two million homeless in Russia and that their numbers are growing because of the war in Ukraine. According to Nochlezhka, the three primary causes of homelessness are low incomes, family problems and the search for work in new places (tochno.st/materials/iz-za-krizisov-v-rossii-vyroslo-cislo-bezdomnyx-no-oficialnoi-statistiki-o-nix-net-my-proanalizirovali-dannye-noclezki-o-tom-kto-i-pocemu-cashhe-vsego-popadaet-na-ulicu). Their numbers rose during the pandemic and have risen even more since the start of Putin’s expanded war in Ukraine which has left many Russians without sufficient money to pay rent, increased problems within some families, and led others to move from one place to another in hopes of finding better jobs. Approximately four out of five are men, some are second generation homeless, and one in ten grew up in an orphanage. But despite public views, fewer homeless are alcoholics or drug abusers than are members of the Russian population as a whole, according to the data collected by Nochlezhka. Most of Russia’s homeless survive on the basis of temporary work or help from families rather than from social services provided by the government. Indeed, the group says, the only government service such people, who now form one in every 70 Russians, can rely is the government’s ambulance service.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzt0T_ociwS8j	2024-11-20T16:56:04-08:00	
Albert Camus’s Thought And Its Impact On Later Thinkers – Analysi...	Albert Camus, the French-Algerian philosopher, writer, and journalist, left an indelible mark on modern intellectual thought through his exploration of absurdity, rebellion, and existential ethics. His ideas, articulated through works such as The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Stranger (1942), and The Rebel (1951), have resonated deeply with later thinkers, influencing diverse fields ranging from existentialism and postmodernism to politics and literature. Camus's unique perspective on the human condition challenged prevailing ideologies and provided a nuanced framework for understanding personal freedom, collective responsibility, and the search for meaning in an indifferent universe. The Core of Camus's Philosophy Camus's philosophy revolves around the concept of the absurd—the tension between human beings' relentless search for meaning and the universe's apparent indifference to that search. Unlike existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre, who sought to transcend the absurd through subjective meaning-making, Camus embraced the absurd as a fundamental condition of existence. For Camus, life's lack of inherent meaning does not lead to despair but calls for defiance and the conscious creation of value. This perspective laid the foundation for his emphasis on rebellion, not as a destructive act, but as an assertion of human dignity and solidarity. Impact on Existentialism: Sartre and De Beauvoir While Camus famously rejected the existentialist label, his work inevitably intersected with and influenced prominent existentialist thinkers, particularly Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Sartre, in his monumental work Being and Nothingness (1943), shared Camus's preoccupation with freedom and responsibility. However, Camus diverged from Sartre in his refusal to embrace Marxist revolutionary violence as a means of achieving freedom. This difference came to a head in their public feud following the publication of Camus's The Rebel, in which he critiqued Marxist ideologies for their justification of historical violence. Simone de Beauvoir, in works such as The Second Sex (1949), explored existential themes of freedom and oppression, particularly in the context of gender. While she was more aligned with Sartre's existentialism, de Beauvoir acknowledged Camus's influence on her conception of personal responsibility and the confrontation with absurdity. Camus's insistence on solidarity as a form of rebellion resonates in her discussions of collective feminist struggles. Postmodern Thinkers: Derrida and Foucault The rise of postmodernism in the latter half of the 20th century saw thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault grappling with issues of meaning, power, and subjectivity, often in ways that echo Camus's absurdist sensibility. Derrida's deconstructionist approach, for instance, can be seen as a philosophical parallel to Camus's insistence on confronting the absurd without resorting to absolute truths. Derrida's emphasis on the instability of meaning aligns with Camus's rejection of ultimate purpose, emphasizing instead the creative potential of human agency in the face of uncertainty. Michel Foucault's analysis of power and resistance bears traces of Camus's influence, particularly in its rejection of totalizing narratives and its focus on individual agency. Foucault's concept of 'counter-conducts' in resisting dominant systems of control echoes Camus's vision of rebellion as a life-affirming act against oppressive ideologies. While Foucault does not explicitly cite Camus as a key influence, their shared emphasis on ethics and freedom in a fragmented world underscores an intellectual kinship. Political Philosophy: Hannah Arendt and Václav Havel Hannah Arendt, a leading 20th-century political theorist, found resonance in Camus's exploration of rebellion and human dignity. In her seminal work The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), Arendt analyzed the dehumanizing effects of totalitarian regimes, themes that Camus also examined in The Plague and The Rebel. Both thinkers emphasized the importance of collective resistance against tyranny and the preservation of human freedom. Arendt's idea of 'natality,' the potential for new beginnings through human action, mirrors Camus's notion of defying absurdity through creative acts. Václav Havel, the Czech playwright, dissident, and later president, openly acknowledged Camus's influence on his political philosophy. Havel's concept of 'living in truth' as a form of resistance to oppressive regimes draws directly from Camus's celebration of personal integrity and rebellion. Camus's works provided a moral and philosophical framework for Havel and other dissidents during the Cold War, underscoring the enduring relevance of his ideas in political resistance. Camus's Influence on Literature Camus's literary legacy extends beyond philosophy, profoundly impacting writers such as Samuel Beckett, James Baldwin, and Milan Kundera. Beckett, in works like Waiting for Godot (1953), explores themes of absurdity and existential inertia that parallel Camus's depiction of human perseverance in The Myth of Sisyphus. The repetitive, purposeless actions of Beckett's characters reflect the absurdist condition Camus described, while also embodying a form of rebellion through endurance. James Baldwin, a towering figure in 20th-century literature, was deeply influenced by Camus's humanism and his critique of systemic injustice. Baldwin's essays, particularly in The Fire Next Time (1963), echo Camus's call for moral courage and solidarity in confronting oppression. Baldwin admired Camus's refusal to succumb to nihilism despite acknowledging the absurdity of the human condition. Milan Kundera, the Czech novelist, found inspiration in Camus's balance of philosophical inquiry and literary expression. Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984) reflects Camus's influence in its exploration of existential freedom and the tension between personal responsibility and historical determinism. Kundera's characters, like Camus's, navigate a world devoid of ultimate meaning, finding significance in their acts of defiance and creation. Contemporary Philosophy and Ethics In contemporary philosophy, thinkers such as Susan Neiman and Bernard-Henri Lévy have carried forward Camus's legacy. Neiman, in her book Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists (2008), draws on Camus's moral philosophy to argue for an ethical framework that combines realism with hope. She sees Camus as a model for engaging with life's challenges without resorting to cynicism or despair. Bernard-Henri Lévy, a prominent French intellectual, has championed Camus's ideas as a guide for navigating the complexities of modern geopolitics. In works such as The Genius of Judaism (2017), Lévy emphasizes the relevance of Camus's humanism in addressing issues of identity, conflict, and reconciliation. Critiques and Challenges to Camus's Thought Despite his widespread influence, Camus's ideas have also faced criticism. Postcolonial theorists, including Edward Said and Frantz Fanon, have critiqued Camus's ambivalence toward colonialism, particularly in the Algerian context. While Camus advocated for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian War, his reluctance to support full independence for Algeria alienated some contemporaries. Additionally, feminist scholars have challenged the gendered implications of Camus's absurd hero, often characterized as a solitary male figure. Thinkers such as Luce Irigaray have called for a more inclusive conception of rebellion that accounts for diverse experiences of oppression and solidarity. Legacy in the 21st Century In an era defined by technological advancement, climate crises, and political polarization, Camus's philosophy continues to offer a compelling lens for understanding the human condition. His call for ethical rebellion and solidarity resonates with movements addressing systemic inequality, environmental degradation, and social justice. Camus's thought has influenced activists and intellectuals alike, from Greta Thunberg's climate activism to the Black Lives Matter movement. His insistence on confronting absurdity with courage and creativity provides a timeless framework for addressing contemporary challenges. Conclusion Albert Camus's thought, rooted in the recognition of life's absurdity, remains a beacon for those seeking to navigate a world fraught with uncertainty and conflict. His influence on thinkers such as Sartre, Arendt, Derrida, and Baldwin highlights the enduring relevance of his ideas in philosophy, politics, and literature. By championing rebellion as an affirmation of human dignity and solidarity, Camus offers a vision of hope and resistance that continues to inspire generations of thinkers and activists.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzpjCAGuT2RmQ	2024-11-20T16:47:49-08:00	
Edward Said And Frantz Fanon: Pioneers Of Postcolonial Thought An...	Edward Said and Frantz Fanon, two intellectual giants of the 20th century, profoundly shaped postcolonial theory and decolonial thought. Said, a literary critic and cultural theorist, and Fanon, a psychiatrist and revolutionary, examined the deep-seated structures of colonialism and their enduring effects on culture, politics, and identity. While their works addressed different aspects of colonialism—Said through cultural critique and Fanon through political and psychological analysis—both shared a commitment to exposing colonial oppression and envisioning paths to liberation. This article explores the seminal contributions of Said and Fanon, their intellectual synergy, and their impact on later thinkers across disciplines, including Gayatri Spivak, Homi Bhabha, Achille Mbembe, Stuart Hall, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, and others. Their ideas continue to resonate in fields as diverse as literary studies, political theory, anthropology, and critical race studies. Frantz Fanon: The Revolutionary Voice of Decolonization Frantz Fanon's major works, including Black Skin, White Masks (1952) and The Wretched of the Earth (1961), offer a searing critique of colonialism's dehumanizing effects on both colonizers and the colonized. Drawing from his experiences as a psychiatrist in Algeria during its war for independence, Fanon analyzed the psychological dimensions of colonialism, highlighting how it internalizes inferiority in the oppressed and superiority in the oppressors. He also called for violent revolution as a means to reclaim identity and autonomy. Edward Said: The Critic of Orientalism Edward Said's Orientalism (1978) revolutionized the study of colonialism by exposing how Western representations of the 'Orient' were rooted in power dynamics and served to justify imperial domination. Said's concept of 'othering' revealed how the West constructed the East as its binary opposite—irrational, backward, and exotic—thereby legitimizing colonial control. Through Culture and Imperialism (1993), Said expanded his critique to include the ways Western literature reinforced imperial ideologies. Synergy and Divergence: Said and Fanon While both thinkers critiqued colonial systems, their approaches differed. Fanon emphasized the necessity of physical and psychological decolonization through revolutionary action, while Said focused on dismantling the cultural narratives that sustained imperial power. Together, they laid the groundwork for a holistic understanding of colonialism's legacy, influencing subsequent scholars who integrated their insights into broader frameworks. Impact on Later Thinkers 1. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: 'Can the Subaltern Speak?' Gayatri Spivak, a postcolonial theorist and literary critic, drew on Said and Fanon to develop her seminal concept of the 'subaltern'—marginalized individuals silenced by colonial and patriarchal systems. In her 1988 essay, Can the Subaltern Speak?, Spivak critiqued Western intellectuals for speaking on behalf of the oppressed rather than enabling their voices to emerge. She also extended Said's critique of cultural representation by emphasizing how imperialism intersected with gender. Spivak's scholarship has influenced feminist theory and postcolonial studies, pushing for greater attention to the intersectionality of race, class, and gender within colonial and postcolonial contexts. 2. Homi K. Bhabha: Hybridity and the Third Space Homi Bhabha built on Said's analysis of cultural representation and Fanon's exploration of identity to articulate key concepts such as hybridity and the 'third space.' In The Location of Culture (1994), Bhabha argued that colonial encounters produce hybrid identities, destabilizing the binary distinctions between colonizer and colonized. Bhabha's ideas have profoundly influenced discussions on globalization and multiculturalism, offering a nuanced understanding of how cultural exchanges reshape identity and power dynamics in postcolonial societies. 3. Achille Mbembe: Necropolitics and the Legacy of Fanon Achille Mbembe, a Cameroonian philosopher, extended Fanon's insights on violence and colonialism to develop his theory of necropolitics. In his 2003 essay of the same name, Mbembe examined how sovereign powers exert control over life and death, particularly in colonial and postcolonial contexts. He also engaged with Said's critique of Western domination by exploring how racial hierarchies are sustained in global systems of capitalism and governance. Mbembe's work has become central to critical race theory and discussions on contemporary forms of structural violence and exclusion. 4. Stuart Hall: Cultural Studies and Identity Politics Stuart Hall, a British cultural theorist, combined insights from Said and Fanon to analyze the interplay between culture, power, and identity. Hall's concept of cultural identity as dynamic and ever-changing draws from Fanon's exploration of identity formation under colonial rule. Hall's analysis of media representations also resonates with Said's critique of Orientalism. Hall's contributions have been foundational to cultural studies, particularly in understanding how race and ethnicity are constructed and contested in popular culture and political discourse. 5. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o: Decolonizing the Mind Kenyan writer and theorist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o directly engaged with Fanon's call for cultural decolonization in his seminal work, Decolonising the Mind (1986). Ngũgĩ argued for the rejection of colonial languages in African literature, emphasizing the need to reclaim indigenous languages as a form of resistance and empowerment. Ngũgĩ's ideas echo Said's critique of cultural imperialism and Fanon's emphasis on reclaiming identity through cultural production, making him a key figure in the global decolonial movement. 6. Arundhati Roy: Postcolonial Activism Indian author and activist Arundhati Roy has drawn from Said's and Fanon's critiques to address contemporary issues of globalization, environmental degradation, and social justice. In essays such as The Algebra of Infinite Justice (2002), Roy critiques the neo-imperial practices of multinational corporations and global powers, echoing Said's analysis of cultural hegemony and Fanon's critique of systemic exploitation. 7. Leela Gandhi: Postcolonial Ethics Leela Gandhi, in Postcolonial Theory: A Critical Introduction (1998), engaged deeply with the works of Said and Fanon to explore the ethical dimensions of postcolonialism. She emphasized the importance of building solidarity between the colonized and the colonizers, drawing from Said's notion of 'contrapuntal reading' and Fanon's vision of a humanist future beyond colonial violence. 8. Walter D. Mignolo: Decolonial Thinking Walter Mignolo, a prominent decolonial theorist, expanded on Said's and Fanon's ideas to develop the concept of 'epistemic disobedience.' In works such as The Darker Side of Western Modernity (2011), Mignolo critiques the dominance of Western epistemologies and calls for a decolonial shift in knowledge production. Contemporary Relevance In the 21st century, Said's and Fanon's ideas remain deeply relevant as scholars and activists grapple with the enduring legacies of colonialism. Movements such as Black Lives Matter, Indigenous land rights campaigns, and global decolonial efforts resonate with their critiques of systemic oppression and calls for liberation. The proliferation of postcolonial and decolonial studies as academic disciplines testifies to their enduring influence. Conclusion Edward Said and Frantz Fanon transformed the intellectual landscape by exposing the cultural, psychological, and structural mechanisms of colonial domination. Their works have inspired generations of thinkers—Spivak, Bhabha, Mbembe, Hall, and others—to explore the complexities of identity, resistance, and liberation in a postcolonial world. By confronting the past and envisioning alternative futures, Said and Fanon's legacy endures as a powerful call for justice, equality, and human dignity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzlqy-bgTdmU8	2024-11-20T16:45:00-08:00	
US, Under Fire, For Vetoing Resolutions Demanding Ceasefire In Ga...	The US veto on a Security Council (UNSC) resolution—demanding an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza—was highly predictable. The resolution, which was vetoed November 20, also called for the release of all hostages and full humanitarian access for civilians. Since 1945, a total of 36 UNSC draft resolutions related to Israel-Palestine have been vetoed by at least one of the five permanent members (P5)—the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France. Of these, 34 were vetoed by the US and two by Russia and China, according to Al Jazeera, the Qatari-based Middle East news network. Meanwhile, the US, a strong ally with undying loyalty to Israel, came under heavy fire for its decision to exercise its veto—for the fourth time on a resolution on Gaza. Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, said the US used its veto, once again, to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza, including mass forced displacement and the use of starvation as a weapon of war. The resolution it rejected also called for the release of Israeli hostages and compliance with international humanitarian law, both of which the US itself has called for. 'By continuing to shield Israeli authorities from pressure and scrutiny, the US is de facto condoning their crimes against humanity,' said Charbonneau. Brenda Moyfa, Head of Oxfam’s New York Office, said: 'It is shameful that the United States has once again used the veto to block consensus on a life-saving ceasefire, while they continue to approve deadly arms transfers to fuel the violence and humanitarian catastrophe.' This latest resolution for humanitarian access and an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza was promising on paper, but has little meaning vetoed, while past resolutions have gone unenforced, she pointed out. Security Council members continue to transfer arms for the Israeli military’s ongoing attacks on Palestinians trapped in Gaza without anywhere safe or the most basic resources to survive. 'The North Gaza governorate is being ethnically cleansed, with desperate civilians being deliberately starved to death in blatant violation of international law. Virtually no aid has entered all of Gaza for weeks now, yet member states continue to look the other way. 'This vote underlines Israel’s continued impunity to commit atrocities in Gaza. We need urgent reform within the UN Security Council. It is a profound failure and dereliction of duty for the member states who have pledged to uphold the UN Charter to maintain peace and protect lives,' Moyfa declared. Asked whether Secretary-General António Guterres has any reaction to the failure of the Gaza ceasefire resolution in the Security Council, UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters November 20: 'I think it’s another example of the regrettable lack of consensus that we’ve seen in the Security Council between Member States and frankly, the lack of implementation of previous resolutions on Gaza'. For his part, the Secretary-General will continue in to support all efforts to see an end to the conflict in Gaza, to achieve the unconditional release of all hostages and to implement the two-state solution, he added. Dujarric also pointed out that the lack of unity among Member States, lack of unity among the Permanent Five 'makes our job that much more challenging.' Unity from the P5, unity from the Security Council as a whole, gives the Secretary-General clearer guidance on how to move on issues politically. 'I’m not going into analysing the motivation behind the various vetoes we’ve seen from the permanent members, but I think especially on humanitarian and political situations, unity is better for the brand. Let me put it that way', said Dujarric. Coincidentally, the 193-member General Assembly is currently debating the uses and abuses of veto powers by the P5. Ambassador Gianluca Greco of Italy told delegates November 20 the veto power is 'the problem'. While understandable in the specific historical context of 1945, nowadays it blatantly contradicts one of the fundamental principles of the UN Charter: that of sovereign equality of States, he said. In too many occasions, he pointed out, it has prevented the Security Council from discharging its vital responsibilities with regard to situations endangering international peace and security, in which the UN could have made a real difference on the ground. 'Which is why Italy has consistently advocated for a Security Council reform that does not exacerbate further the functional malaises of the Council by adding new permanent members with veto powers', he declared. Speaking on behalf of Germany, Michael Geisler, Political Coordinator, told delegates limiting both the scope and actual use of the veto is essential for creating a more inclusive, transparent, and responsive Security Council. 'Germany strongly advocates for restraint in the exercise of the veto, particularly in cases involving mass atrocities and war crimes, in order to prioritize the protection of civilians in conflict situations. We call upon all Member States to support the ACT Code of Conduct and the French-Mexican Initiative on veto restraint', he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtztOquzvuSidQ	2024-11-20T16:44:06-08:00	
Getting Ukraine To A Position Of Strength: A Strategy For The Tru...	By Luke Coffey Why Ukraine Matters to the United States Below are five reasons why Ukraine is important to US interests. 1. Protecting the US economy. North America and Europe account for nearly half of the world’s GDP. Two-thirds of foreign investment into the US comes from Europe, and 48 states export more to Europe than to China. This supports millions of American jobs. European stability, which Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine undermines, benefits the US economy and, by extension, the American worker. Aiding Ukraine helps preserve that stability. 2. Detering Chinese aggression. Russia is China’s junior partner. A weakened or defeated Russia means a weaker China. Beijing is watching how the West supports Ukraine. A strong and victorious Ukraine makes Taiwan appear stronger and deters Chinese aggression. 3. Succeeding in great power competition. Russia’s war against Ukraine is central to America’s great power competition against the Russia–China–Iran–North Korea axis. North Korea has provided 10,000 soldiers, millions of artillery shells, and hundreds of missiles to Russia in exchange for military technology. Meanwhile, Iran provides Russia with drones and ballistic missiles in exchange for fighter jets and other advanced capabilities. China’s technical, economic, and diplomatic support for Russia enables all this as part of Beijing’s strategy to undermine the US. 4. Preparing the US military enterprise for twenty-first-century warfare. Support for Ukraine has exposed major shortcomings in the US defense industrial base that can now be fixed. The war has also tested American-made military hardware in a way not possible in peacetime—with no American casualties. The US is learning what works, what does not work, and how systems evolve in combat. And as Ukraine receives US weapons, America replaces its own weapons stocks with newer, more effective systems. 5. Demonstrating strength. A successful Ukraine demonstrates American strength. However, acquiescing to Putin and abandoning partners shows the world American weakness. Even forcing Ukraine into a deal that lopsidedly benefits Russia would embolden US adversaries and cause America’s allies to hedge toward other security arrangements. What President Trump Needs to Do President-elect Donald Trump is sincere in his desire to end the war, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has emphasized that he wants a 'fair' end to the war. But the end needs to be just and honorable. The incoming Trump administration needs to change course from the Biden administration’s approach so Ukraine can enter any negotiations from a position of strength. Below are seven steps to do so. 1. Take meaningful steps to close sanctions loopholes. Russia diverts much of its trade through a network of partners to skirt Western sanctions. The US and its allies need to crack down on sanctions evasion to truly cripple the Russian economy. 2. Encourage European partners to establish an air defense mission in Poland and Romania. Russian missiles and drones routinely violate NATO airspace. Alliance members should use Polish and Romanian territory to intercept missiles or drones headed toward a NATO member, even in western Ukrainian airspace. This is a reasonable act of self-defense with a low risk of escalation because neither US nor NATO forces will be in direct confrontation with Russian troops. The mission would protect major Ukrainian population centers such as Lviv, allowing Kyiv to reposition scarce air defense systems closer to the front line. 3. Promote a pro-America energy policy. Congress and the executive branch should revoke all restrictions on liquefied natural gas exports. President Trump’s policies to unshackle US oil and gas production and his administration’s relationships with Gulf states could give the president powerful leverage on global energy prices. This would weaken one of Russia’s remaining economic lifelines. 4. Develop a strategy to boost Ukraine’s defense sector and integrate it with America’s. Ukraine’s defense sector has a highly skilled, innovative, and educated workforce. Before Russia’s 2014 invasion, Ukraine was among the top 10 global defense exporters. Even as it fights, Ukraine has debuted groundbreaking weapons systems, especially in the unmanned category. Bolstering Ukraine’s domestic defense industry is one of the best long-term guarantees of the country’s security. 5. Think boldly and creatively about weapons. The next administration should break President Joe Biden’s predictable cycle and show strength in the weapons it sends to Ukraine. So it should continue providing Kyiv with more of the weapons it has already used successfully, and consider arming Ukraine with longer-range weapons such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile Block III and Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER). 6. Remove all restrictions on the use of American-provided weapons and encourage European partners to do the same. By adhering to Russia’s dubious red lines, Washington allows Moscow to dictate the conflict’s terms. If the Kremlin’s forces strike Ukraine from Russian territory, the US should show strength and allow Kyiv to use any weapons system against any legitimate military target, even those inside Russia. 7. Urge Congress to (a) pass another Ukraine supplemental during the lame-duck session and (b) legislate for the seizure of frozen Russian assets to be used for Ukraine aid. Both actions would strengthen President Trump’s hand when he takes office in January.

Belarus: Lukashenko Pardons 32 More Political Prisoners Of Estima...	(RFE/RL) -- Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the authoritarian ruler of Belarus, has pardoned an additional 32 political prisoners, according to reports from the pro-government Pul Pervogo Telegram channel, although an estimated 1,300 opposition activists remain behind bars in the country. The identities of those pardoned were not disclosed, but the report said they had all been convicted of extremism, a charge widely used against political activists. The report further identified the pardoned individuals as 24 men and eight women, with nine of them above the age of 50. The pardons released the individuals from serving their full sentences but did not remove their criminal records. Their behavior will continue to be monitored by the Interior Ministry after their release, the report said. This marks the sixth instance of political prisoner pardons in Belarus this year, bringing the total number of individuals set free to 178. Earlier this month, 31 political prisoners were pardoned. In July, the government pardoned 18 people, including Ryhor Kastusyou, the former leader of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front party who had been serving a 10-year sentence and is reportedly in poor health. Additional pardons followed in August (30 individuals), early September (30), and mid-September (37). In mid-November, prominent opposition figure Maryya Kalesnikava, who is serving an 11-year sentence on charges of conspiring to seize power, met with her father for the first time in 21 months. A month earlier, Lukashenka had suggested he might consider pardoning Kalesnikava if she submitted a formal request. However, it remains unclear whether she has accepted the offer. Kalesnikava has previously refused to request a pardon, maintaining her innocence and rejecting the legitimacy of the charges against her. The latest pardons come in the context of a harsh crackdown on dissent following the mass protests in Belarus in 2020, sparked by contested presidential election results. Lukashenka responded to the demonstrations with widespread repression, forcing at least 13,000 people into exile. According to human rights organizations, approximately 1,300 political prisoners remain in Belarusian jails, including politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, and civic activists. Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for January 2025, with Lukashenka widely expected to be declared the winner.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzqRCDuDRJ0Mw	2024-11-20T16:34:03-08:00	
HRW: Proposed US Landmine Transfers Gravely Threaten Civilians	The Biden administration’s decision to transfer internationally banned antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine risks civilian lives and rejects the most successful humanitarian disarmament treaty of the past 25 years, Human Rights Watch said today. On November 19, 2024, the Washington Post reported that US President Joe Biden had authorized providing antipersonnel mines to Ukraine, which US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on November 20. 'They’ve [Ukraine] asked for these, and so I think it’s a good idea,' Austin told the New York Times. 'President Biden’s decision to transfer antipersonnel landmines risks civilian lives and sets back international efforts to eradicate these indiscriminate weapons,' said Mary Wareham, deputy crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch. 'The US should reverse this reprehensible decision, which only increases the risk of civilian suffering in the short and long term.' A majority of the world’s countries rejected antipersonnel landmines decades ago due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term human suffering that they cause, Human Rights Watch said. Antipersonnel mines are designed to explode in response to a person’s presence, proximity, or contact. They are typically placed by hand, but they can also be scattered by aircraft, rockets, and artillery or dispersed from specialized vehicles. Antipersonnel mines cannot distinguish between soldiers and civilians, making them unlawfully indiscriminate under international humanitarian law. Uncleared landmines pose a danger until cleared and destroyed. Mined land can drive displacement of the civilian population, hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid, and prevent agricultural activities. Civilians made up 84 percent of all recorded landmine casualties in 2023, while children were 37 percent of casualties when the age was recorded. The United States has not used antipersonnel mines since 1991, has not exported them since 1992, has not produced them since 1997, and had no plans for future procurement. Over the past 30 years, the US has destroyed antipersonnel mines from its stockpile and has spent more than $1 billion on the development and production of systems that could be considered alternatives to antipersonnel mines. On June 21, 2022, President Biden announced a policy committing the US not to use antipersonnel mines anywhere in the world, except on the Korean Peninsula, and set the goal of ultimately joining the Mine Ban Treaty. Under that policy, the US committed to destroy antipersonnel mine stockpiles that are 'not required for the defense of the Korean Peninsula.' It promised that it would not develop, produce, or acquire antipersonnel mines. The policy explicitly requires the US 'not [to] assist, encourage, or induce anyone, outside the context of the Korean Peninsula, to engage in activity that would be prohibited' by the Mine Ban Treaty. In September 1994, the US became the first country to call for the 'eventual elimination' of antipersonnel landmines and participated in the 1996-1997 Ottawa Process that created the Mine Ban Treaty. The US did not adopt or sign the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997, but the Clinton administration set the goal for the US to join the treaty in 2006. The George W. Bush administration reversed that objective in 2004. In 2014, the Barack Obama administration issued a US landmine policy banning the production and acquisition of antipersonnel mines, as well as halting their use by US forces anywhere except on the Korean Peninsula. In January 2020, then-president and current President-elect Donald Trump canceled a policy that would have eliminated all antipersonnel mines in the US stockpile. The existing US stockpile of antipersonnel mines is expected to expire—meaning that the mines will become unusable—by the early 2030s, in part because their 36-year shelf-life decreases over time as batteries embedded inside the mines deteriorate with age. The 2014 policy precluded the US from extending or modifying the life of the batteries in its stockpiled antipersonnel mines. The 2022 policy was understood to continue that practice. The Mine Ban Treaty entered into force on March 1, 1999; it comprehensively bans antipersonnel mines and requires destruction of stocks, clearance of mined areas, and assistance to victims. A total of 164 countries have joined the treaty, including all NATO member states, except the US; all European Union member states; and US allies such as Australia, Japan, and Ukraine. Ukraine ratified the Mine Ban Treaty on December 27, 2005, while Russia has not joined it. The US transfer decision comes days before the Fifth Review Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty, to be held in Siem Reap, Cambodia from November 25-29. The US and Ukraine have registered to attend the event, also known as the Siem Reap Summit on a Mine-Free World. Russia has used antipersonnel landmines widely in Ukraine since its full-scale invasion of the country on February 24, 2022, causing hundreds of casualties and contaminating vast tracts of agricultural land. Russia has also created an unprecedented situation in which a country that is not party to the Mine Ban Treaty is using the weapon on the territory of a treaty party. Human Rights Watch has also documented Ukrainian use of antipersonnel mines in violation of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium, Kharkivska province, in 2022, when the city was under Russian control. Ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating reports that forces used rocket-fired antipersonnel mines. By accepting and using antipersonnel mines, Ukraine risks further violating the Mine Ban Treaty, Human Rights Watch said. Under article 20 of the Mine Ban Treaty, a state party engaging in armed conflict is not allowed to withdraw from the treaty before the end of the armed conflict. The treaty is also not subject to reservations. 'Russian forces have repeatedly used antipersonnel mines and committed atrocities against civilians across Ukraine in violation of the laws of war, but this doesn’t justify transferring and using prohibited weapons,' Wareham said. 'Abiding by international protections for civilians means working to ensure that antipersonnel mines are never used again.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzuLb8p71SqDX	2024-11-20T16:30:25-08:00	
As Chinese Buyers Snap Up Chiang Mai Properties, Thais Fear For F...	By Wittayakorn Boonruang Visitors who walk through a new housing development in Hang Dong, a district of Chiang Mai, might think they’ve stumbled into a slice of China because Chinese letters dominate storefront signs. This isn’t isolated to Hang Dong. Across Chiang Mai, Thailand’s northern cultural capital, Chinese investment is rapidly reshaping entire neighborhoods – and raising alarm about the city’s future identity and economic independence. 'If Chinese investors seriously enter the dormitory business and buy up properties to rent at higher prices exclusively to Chinese tenants, people living paycheck to paycheck who rent cheap accommodations will definitely struggle,' Naret Puntasrivichai, 43, who runs a monthly apartment rental business in Hang Dong, told BenarNews. His concerns aren’t unfounded. Over the past decade, buyers from mainland China have snapped up more than 1,000 housing units in Chiang Mai, with investments totaling between 3 billion and 5 billion baht (U.S. $86.1 million and $143.5 million), according to the Chiang Mai Real Estate Association. These properties, with pricetags starting at 3 million baht ($86,133) per unit, have spread across Chiang Mai’s three major districts – Hang Dong, San Kamphaeng and San Sai. In Hang Dong district alone, one Chinese-backed project spent 350 million baht ($10 million) on only four acres of land – a level of investment that dwarfs local developers’ capabilities, Prachachat Business, a local newspaper, reported in early 2023. The Chiang Mai Provincial Office reported that the city has a population of about 1.62 million Thai nationals, 7,190 Chinese and about 150,000 people from other nationalities. In addition to the 7,190 residents, many other Chinese take advantage of tourist visas allowing them to stay in Thailand for up to 60 days per visit. In Chiang Mai, it is common for Chinese nationals to use this route to reside and conduct business, according to authorities. In 2023, Chinese nationals were the largest group of tourists – about 200,000 – traveling to Chiang Mai. 'Chinese investors are transforming Chiang Mai from a tourist destination into their second home,' said Danaitun Pongpatcharatrontep who heads Chiang Mai University’s China Intelligence Center. 'They’re planning businesses in tourism and second-home construction, bringing their children to study here and establishing long-term residences for elderly Chinese. Investment comes both through pure Chinese companies and joint ventures with Thais,' he told BenarNews. Europeans, Americans and Middle Easterners dominated foreign property purchases in Thailand before the COVID-19 pandemic forced travel restrictions. Today, Chinese buyers outstrip not just other foreigners but even Thai nationals in the local property market, according to the Chiang Mai Real Estate Association 2024 report. Property prices in Chiang Mai can be several times lower than in China and budget airlines offer direct flights from major Chinese cities, cutting travel times to two to three hours. For China’s burgeoning middle class, Chiang Mai represents an affordable slice of paradise. In major cities Beijing and Shanghai, housing prices can average $6,800 to $8,400 per square meter, meaning a 1,200 square-foot (110 square-meter) home could cost $740,000 or more – compared to $80,000 to $180,000 in Chiang Mai. A 2023 survey by private education company New Oriental found many Chinese families choose Thailand to educate their children, where tuition and cost of living are lower than in Singapore and Japan. Local losses Thai law restricts foreign condominium ownership to 49% of total units and bars foreigners from owning land or houses. Yet Chinese investors have found creative ways around these restrictions, often using Thai nominees to hold their businesses. 'These practices not only circumvent the law but could affect the country’s economic system and security in the long term,' said Naret, who rents apartments in Hang Dong. 'Chinese investors often operate through informal channels, avoiding official registration while maintaining significant control over properties.' Local real estate professionals have experienced the change, according to agent Hathairat Polnirun, 38. 'The Chinese real estate system differs greatly from Thailand’s,' she told BenarNews. 'In Thailand, sellers pay commissions of 3% to 5%, while in the Chinese system, buyers pay 10% or more, making it impossible for Thai agents to compete when selling to Chinese clients.' This occurs when buyers, sellers and brokers negotiate additional terms beyond those stipulated by law, she said. 'Recently, Chinese operators have begun establishing their own real estate companies directly, though often using Thai names as cover,' Hathairat said. 'If large Chinese real estate companies with substantial capital enter this market, small agencies – both Thai and Chinese – won’t survive.' In September, a small survey by a local think-tank, The Glocal, reported on concerns among a group of Thai residents. Of the 30 respondents between the ages of 19 and 62, 60% said Chinese investment significantly impacted local businesses. The real estate sector topped concerns at 40%, followed by tourism (20%) and retail (16.7%). Notably, 17 supported increased regulation of Chinese investment. In neighborhoods with high Chinese concentration, cultural friction is becoming more apparent. 'Their behavior creates discomfort for Chiang Mai and Thai people, who have a culture of politeness, humility, and mutual respect,' Naret said, citing issues from loud conversations to traffic law violations to disregard for customs. Stricter control A legal analyst has advocated for comprehensive oversight. Tossapon Tassanapan, an associated professor at Chiang Mai University’s Faculty of Law, called for a thorough investigation of business practices. 'We must examine all aspects, from entry permits to financial transactions,' he said. 'While general laws don’t specifically target Chinese investment, as we must treat all foreigners equally, we need to investigate whether their activities fall into gray areas, whether officials are complicit and whether there are connections to money laundering or other criminal activities.' The solution, Tossapon said, involves rigorous enforcement of existing laws. 'We need to check everything – from tourist visas being used for business purposes to tax payments and financial trails. If these businesses can operate, it likely indicates either official complicity or negligence.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzjz6UQInD2wU	2024-11-20T16:24:54-08:00	
What The Arakan Army’s Rise Means For The Rohingya – Analysis	By Dr. Azeem Ibrahim The Arakan Army is emerging as the dominant force in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, a dramatic shift that could redefine the region’s political landscape. Over the past year, this group has not only entrenched itself militarily, but it has also sought to carve out a role as a governing authority. This transformation, while significant, brings both opportunities and challenges for Rakhine’s people, including the long-persecuted Rohingya minority. The Arakan Army’s military achievements are striking. By mid-October, it had established control over an estimated two-thirds of Rakhine State, including critical areas such as the state capital Sittwe, the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone and the Myanmar military’s strategically important Western Command base. This consolidation is underpinned by the creation of nine military zones across the state and the deployment of thousands of troops in allied territories. This rise from obscurity is remarkable. Founded in 2009 with just 26 members, the Arakan Army now fields a force of about 40,000 troops. Its rapid growth reflects both its military prowess and its ability to position itself as a credible alternative to Myanmar’s junta. Yet, despite its successes on the battlefield, it faces significant governance challenges. The International Crisis Group notes that, while the Arakan Army has established de facto control over much of Rakhine, it lacks the capacity to address the state’s fundamental socioeconomic needs. The coming years will test whether it can translate its military dominance into effective governance. The Arakan Army has already taken steps toward governance. Even before the 2021 coup, it managed administrative and judiciary services in parts of Rakhine. Since gaining more territory, it has sought to establish legitimacy by engaging with diverse communities. For instance, it invited Rohingya representatives into its governance mechanisms and played a leading role in post-Cyclone Mocha recovery efforts in May 2023. These moves are critical for a state as fragmented as Rakhine, where ethnic and communal divisions run deep. By fostering inclusion, the Arakan Army has an opportunity to unify Rakhine’s communities and build a foundation for sustainable governance. However, its track record is mixed. In April and May, during the final stages of its offensive against junta forces, the group committed atrocities against civilians, including the shelling, looting and burning of Rohingya neighborhoods in Buthidaung Township. These actions, which forced thousands to flee, underscore the tension between its aspirations and its actions on the ground. The rise of the Arakan Army also changes the calculus for the Rohingya, who have historically borne the brunt of Myanmar’s ethnic strife. Its inclusive overtures, such as engaging Rohingya representatives, are promising. However, these gestures must be accompanied by genuine efforts to protect Rohingya communities and ensure their rights. The group’s actions during the Buthidaung offensive highlight the precarious position of the Rohingya. While the Arakan Army may view the Rohingya as a potential constituency, its willingness to commit violence against them suggests that ethnic hierarchies and power struggles still dominate Rakhine’s politics. For the Rohingya, the group’s rise presents both risks and opportunities. On the one hand, its dominance could offer a respite from the systematic persecution they have faced under the junta. On the other hand, its ability to govern inclusively and protect minority rights remains unproven. As the Arakan Army transitions from a rebel force to a governing authority, it will face immense challenges. Rakhine is one of Myanmar’s poorest states, with high levels of poverty, displacement and ethnic tension. Addressing these issues requires more than military strength; it demands a commitment to inclusive governance, economic development and reconciliation. The group’s relationship with the Rohingya will be a litmus test for its governance. If it can protect Rohingya communities, integrate them into its governance structures and address their grievances, it could pave the way for a more stable and inclusive Rakhine. However, continued violence and exclusion will only deepen the state’s divisions. The international community has a role to play in shaping Rakhine’s future. Diplomatic engagement with the Arakan Army should prioritize the protection of minority rights and the establishment of inclusive governance. Humanitarian assistance should be directed toward addressing the state’s urgent socioeconomic needs, particularly in Rohingya communities. At the same time, accountability for human rights abuses must remain a priority. Its actions in Buthidaung demonstrate the risks of unchecked power. Holding all actors accountable, including the Arakan Army, is essential for building a foundation of trust and justice in Rakhine. The group’s rise marks a new chapter in Rakhine’s troubled history. Its military dominance offers an opportunity to break free from decades of junta rule, but its ability to govern inclusively and address the state’s deep-seated challenges remains uncertain. For the Rohingya, its ascent is a double-edged sword, offering hope for change but also exposing them to new risks. The road ahead for the Arakan Army and Rakhine is fraught with challenges. Success will depend on the group’s willingness to transcend its origins as a rebel force and embrace its responsibilities as a governing authority. For the sake of Rakhine’s diverse communities, including the Rohingya, this transition cannot come soon enough.

Indo-Pacific Commander Gives Unvarnished View Of Situation In Reg...	By Jim Garamone Any discussion of the Indo-Pacific region must start with China as a rising global power, and Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo gave a snapshot of what military competition with China would look like for the United States. Paparo, the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, spoke to Michael O'Hanlon and Lynn Kuok at the Brookings Institution, yesterday. The admiral also answered questions about North Korea and India during the wide-ranging discussion at the Washington think tank. China is demonstrating and working on improving its power. This past summer, China held exercises that covered a large geographical area and one that demonstrated joint capabilities, and the admiral followed them closely. 'It was the 'jointest' operations for air, missile, maritime power that I'd seen over an entire career of being an observer,' Paparo said. On one day, he noted, the Chinese had 152 vessels at sea, including three quarters of their amphibious force. He said the People's Republic of China exercised 43 amphibious brigades to include rehearsal in breaching obstacles and military operations in urban terrain. 'We saw also two demonstrations of military power in response to the Taiwan inauguration on May 20, and then, once again, on 1010 [October 10th] — Taiwan National Day, as it's so called,' he said. 'This was the largest rehearsal we've seen,' he said. It demonstrated the upward trajectory of PLA modernization. The Chinese military also exercised with Russian air and maritime forces this summer in the Bering Sea. That exercise included ships and long-range aviation, he said. China is not the only competitor in the region, and Paparo specifically talked about the threat North Korea poses to the region and beyond. He pointed to the recent test of its largest ballistic missile this past week. That missile 'reached an apogee of over 7,000 kilometers, portending a capability that will have the ability to range the entire continental United States,' he said. He added that the North Koreans have not demonstrated the capability of weaponizing the missile 'but we just see continued testing towards that.' But China is the main competitor in the region and Paparo was grilled on Chinese capabilities and intentions. He was specifically asked about the Chinese initiative to build a military that can challenge the United States by the centennial of the Chinese Communist Party in 2027. 'The closer we get to 2027 the less relevant the date becomes,' he said. He does not see that as the date the Chinese would invade Taiwan. 'I think it is a worthy benchmark to say, we had better pay close attention to this,' the admiral said. Paparo has the responsibility under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to be ready for any change to the status quo. 'I am responsible for being ready every single day,' he said. The United States has worldwide commitments and there are competing requirements for resources and systems. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Hamas attack on Israel are depleting stocks the Indo-Pacific might need, Paparo said. He said that until this year the effect on his command by the delivery of systems to Ukraine and Israel was negligible. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it is now eating into stocks, … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he said. These high-end stocks are crucial in the Indo-Pacific, he said. 'It imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because [China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' Paparo said. Paparo also addressed the growing U.S. military partnership with India. The two countries are cooperating across a range of areas including undersea domain awareness, joint production and more. 'We see this security partnership growing year by year,' he said. 'India cherishes its history in the non-aligned movement. So those who aspire to an alliance with India, I think, don't hold your breath. We're not holding our breath either.' But that does not temper U.S. moves to a deeper partnership and deeper friendship with India. China also competes with India. 'There have been flash points of tension at sea and along its border, and those are opportunities for our cooperation as well,' the admiral said. India has ties with Russia, who supplied much of the weapons systems India used since the 1960s. 'I believe that those partnerships will likely fade over time as the partnership between the United States and India grows, but we cannot be complacent about it,' he said. 'But we have many, many mutual interests, and we've got to — both of us — keep our foot on the accelerator.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzvjtOoivvswD	2024-11-20T16:18:08-08:00	
Austin Announces Additional Security Assistance For Ukraine	By Joseph Clark The U.S. is sending a new round of military assistance, valued at up to $275 million to Ukraine, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said today. The package includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, mortar and artillery rounds and unmanned aerial systems to meet critical battlefield needs as Russia's war of aggression surpasses 1,000 days. In previewing the White House announcement of the latest round of assistance, Austin underscored the importance of continuing to support Ukraine. 'What we learned early on is that Ukraine matters and not just to Ukraine, and not just to Europe,' Austin said. 'It matters to the world. 'We shouldn't have any situation where someone can wake up one day and attack its neighbor and change the borders and annex its neighbor's property,' he said. 'That is just not the world that any of us want to live in.' The secretary added that the U.S.-led efforts to rally global allies and partners in support of Ukraine continue to be effective in countering Russia's onslaught. 'The largest military in Europe invaded its neighbor, who had a much smaller inventory, much less capability, and 1,000 days later they've yet to be successful,' he said. 'This war has gone on for 1,000 days and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has failed in every case to achieve any sort of strategic objective.' The latest round of assistance marks the 70th drawdown of military equipment for Ukraine from DOD inventories since August 2021. It follows President Joe Biden's commitment in September to surge the more than $5 billion in remaining presidential drawdown authority funds authorized by Congress. The assistance also comes with new urgency as Russia leans on thousands of North Korean troops to fill out its ranks. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said earlier this week that nearly 11,000 North Korean troops have moved into Russia's Kursk Region. She said the Pentagon had not confirmed reports that the North Koreans had begun to engage in combat operations but said, 'They're moving into Kursk for a reason.' 'We have every expectation that they would be engaged in combat operations,' Singh said. Austin announced a new round of assistance from Vientiane, Laos, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus. U.S. defense secretaries have participated in the forum since 2010 when it was established by the 10-member bloc of Southeast Asian nations. During the two-day series of engagements, Austin will meet with a range of regional allies and partners informally during the meeting and reaffirm the United States' commitment to regional security. Following the first round of discussions today, Austin announced that ASEAN member states approved a second iteration of a U.S.-led maritime exercise with ASEAN countries, which was first held in 2019. Tomorrow, Austin is expected to announce the first-ever Defense Department vision statement for a prosperous and secure Southeast Asia. 'It's great to be back at the ADMM-Plus for my fourth time as secretary,' he said. 'Being here is a priority and a sign of strong support for ASEAN's central role in regional security. Engagement with ASEAN is focused on practical cooperation and mutual respect, and that includes training the next generation of leaders and tackling emerging challenges and deepening maritime cooperation.' Austin proposed a meeting with People's Republic of China's Minister of National Defense Dong Jun, who's also a member of ADMM-Plus. The secretary has continued to advocate for open lines of military-to-military communication between the U.S. and China but said today that his Chinese counterpart chose not to meet during this week's forum. 'The PRC decision is a setback for the whole region,' he said. 'As I've said consistently, the right time to meet is any time.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzumYJY-jPWxA	2024-11-20T16:13:29-08:00	
US Vetoes UN Resolution Calling For Ceasefire In Gaza And Release...	By Ephrem Kossaify The US on Wednesday used the power of veto it holds as one of the five permanent member of the UN Security Council to block a resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire' in Gaza and 'the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The resolution was put forward by the 10 elected, non-permanent members of the council. The US was the only one of the 15 members not to vote in favor of it. The text of the resolution also called for the 'safe and unhindered entry of humanitarian assistance at scale' to Gaza, including besieged areas in the north of the territory, and denounced any attempt to deliberately starve the population there. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October last year, and the UN says that in excess of 70 percent of the verified deaths were among women and children. More than 130,000 people have been injured. The UN believes these figures to be an underestimate, given that scores of bodies are thought to be buried under the rubble of destroyed or damaged buildings. The war has also displaced almost the entire population of the enclave, resulting in a humanitarian catastrophe. On Monday, the UN’s Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices presented a report to the General Assembly in which it said the methods of warfare employed by Israel in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a weapon, the mass civilian casualties and the life-threatening conditions deliberately inflicted on Palestinians, are consistent with the characteristics of genocide. After the Security Council failed to adopt the resolution on Wednesday, Majed Bamya, the Palestinian deputy ambassador to the UN, told its members that they were witnessing an attempt 'to annihilate a nation' and yet the 'very tools designed to respond (to this are) not being used.' He added: 'Maybe for some we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin color, but we are humans and we should be treated as such. 'Is there a UN Charter for Israel that is different from the charter you all have? Is there an international law for them? An international law for us? Do they have the right to kill and the only right we have is to die? 'What more can (Israel) do for this council to act under Chapter 7? Or will this council be the last place on earth that cannot recognize a threat to peace when they see it?' Chapter 7 of the UN Charter relates to action that can be taken by member states in response to threats to peace and acts of aggression. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, told council members: 'Today, a shameful attempt to abandon our kidnapped men and women by the UN was prevented. Thanks to the US, we stood firm with our position that there will be no ceasefire without the release of the hostages. We will continue in this struggle until everyone returns home.' Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador, said that an unconditional ceasefire would mean acceptance by the Security Council of Hamas remaining in power in Gaza. 'The United States will never accept this,' he added. 'Rather than adopting a resolution that emboldens Hamas, let’s instead demand Hamas implement Resolution 2735 without further condition or delay. 'Let’s continue to ensure Israel facilitates additional humanitarian aid into Gaza, and let's work to bring a durable end to the suffering and misery of Hamas’ many victims.' Security Council Resolution 2735, which was adopted in June, calls on Hamas to accept a proposed hostage and ceasefire agreement with Israel. British envoy Barbara Woodward, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the council this month, expressed regret over the failure of the council to adopt the resolution but vowed to 'keep striving, alongside our partners, to bring this war to a close.' She said: 'The deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic and unacceptable. All of Gaza is at risk of famine, and in some areas this is likely to be imminent. Yet the aid reaching civilians remains entirely insufficient to mitigate this unfolding disaster. 'The unthinkable hardship that civilians are already facing in Gaza is set to get even worse as winter approaches.' Woodward urged Israeli authorities to take 'urgent action to alleviate this crisis. International humanitarian law must be respected by all sides.' China’s ambassador to the UN, Fu Cong, said that even with the imminent threat of famine in Gaza, 'the United States always seems to be able to find a justification to defend Israel.' It is a stance that represents a distortion of international humanitarian law, he added. 'People keep learning something new they never knew before was possible, and how low one can stoop. No wonder people feel angry,' said Fu. 'People’s indignation also stems from the fact that the continued supply of weapons from the US (to Israel) has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long, causing so many casualties and so much destruction.' He added: 'All hostages must be released. An immediate and unconditional ceasefire must be established. Both are important factors. There should be no conditionality. They cannot be linked to each other because facts have shown that Israel’s military operations in Gaza have long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages. 'Insistence on setting a precondition for ceasefire is tantamount to giving the green light to continuing the war and condoning the continued killing.' The Algerian ambassador, Amar Bendjama, told the council after the vote: 'Today’s message is clear. 'To the Israeli occupying power: You may continue your genocide and collective punishment of the Palestinian people with complete impunity. In this chamber, you enjoy immunity. 'To the Palestinian people: While the majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.' Nicolas de Riviere, France’s permanent representative to the UN, lamented the latest failure by the council to help bring an end to the war. 'France voted in favor of this resolution and deeply regrets that the (Security Council) remains unable to speak with one voice on the situation in the Middle East.' The Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, directly addressed his US counterpart and accused him of being responsible for the deaths 'of tens of thousands of innocent civilians (and) the suffering of hostages and illegally detained Palestinians.' He added: 'It was very interesting to hear the American representative today, in the wake of the vote, say that the resolution does not contain provisions on the release of hostages. Well, it does contain such a provision. Perhaps the US representative should read through the resolution before voting against it.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzqnu0p5u7YVZ	2024-11-20T16:07:21-08:00	
Jimmy Lai Takes The Stand In Yearslong Hong Kong National Securit...	By Daniel Payne Catholic human rights activist Jimmy Lai on Wednesday took the stand in his national security trial in Hong Kong, arguing in his own defense as he faces life in prison over allegations of sedition against the communist Chinese government. Lai, 76, was first arrested in August 2020 under China’s newly instituted Hong Kong national security law. He has faced multiple trials since his arrest and has been convicted on multiple charges of unlawful assembly and fraud. Advocates have argued that the charges are politically motivated. Lai, through several media enterprises including the long-running Apple Daily newspaper, has for years been a vocal pro-democracy voice in Hong Kong media, with Apple Daily itself encouraging citizens to participate in numerous pro-democracy demonstrations over the years. Chinese Communist Party officials, meanwhile, allege that Lai has engaged in what they claim is seditious activism, in part by allegedly advocating for Hong Kong’s independence from mainland China. At his trial on Wednesday, Lai denied allegations of sedition. 'All I was doing was carrying a torch to the reality,' he told the court of his publishing activities. 'The more information you have, the more you’re in the know, the more you are free,' he said. The publisher also denied that he had ordered the Apple Daily to continue as usual after his arrest. 'I had written to them, asking them not to take risks,' he said. The activist further disputed that he had colluded with the U.S. government in 2019 when meeting with then-Vice President Mike Pence. 'I would not dare to ask the vice president to do anything,' he said. 'I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me.' Wednesday’s trial comes after the Tuesday sentencing of 45 other Hong Kong democracy activists, all of whom received stretches of up to 10 years in prison under the national security law. Lai is a Catholic. He converted to Catholicism in 1997 and was received into the Church by Cardinal Joseph Zen. The cardinal was present at the trial on Wednesday, sitting with Lai’s family members, according to the Associated Press. His yearslong imprisonment has drawn international rebuke, including from supporters in the United States. Last December the Congressional Executive Commission on China urged the U.S. government to sanction Hong Kong prosecutors and judges if they fail to release Lai. The trial 'is a political prosecution plain and simple and another sad example of the Hong Kong government’s increasingly repressive policies,' the commission said. Father Robert Sirico, a Catholic priest and founder of the Michigan-based Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, told CNA in December 2023 that he '[doesn’t] have any hope' that the Chinese Communist Party will let Lai walk free. 'I want to be hopeful. I love the man,' Sirico said. 'I have a deep respect for him. I’m inspired by his bravery. But I know what he’s up against.' More recently, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said in a report that the Chinese government should 'release Mr. Lai immediately.' The working group said the government should mount a 'full and independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr. Lai and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of his rights.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdU_2SSWgJtzuroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-20T16:03:27-08:00	
Russia Says Ukraine Used ATACMS Against Military Target In Bryans...	By Merhat Sharipzhan (RFE/RL) -- The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on November 19 that Ukraine used six U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles in its attack on the Bryansk region overnight, claiming Russian forces managed to shoot down five of the missiles and damage one. According to the ministry, fragments from the damaged ATACMS fell on a military target, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. The ministry also said there were no casualties. Hours earlier, the Russian RBK news agency quoted an informed source within Ukraine's military as saying Kyiv had used ATACMS missiles for the first time, targeting an object in the city of Karachev in Russia's southwestern Bryansk region, successfully damaging the facility. The timing of this operation, coinciding with the 1,000th day of Russia's invasion, carries symbolic weight. By demonstrating its capacity to retaliate with precision and range, observers believe Ukraine seeks to shift the strategic calculus of the war, showing Russian territory is not immune from direct attacks. The same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an updated nuclear doctrine. This revision allows for the consideration of nuclear weapons use if Russia faces a conventional missile assault supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine now includes attacks with conventional missiles, drones, or other aircraft as potential triggers for a nuclear response. Additionally, any aggression against Russia by a state allied with a nuclear power will be viewed as aggression by the entire coalition. Ukrainians awoke on November 19 to news of yet another deadly Russian drone strike on a residential building. Ukrainian authorities said that six people were killed, including one child, in the early morning attack that hit a five-story building in the city of Hlukhiv, in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region. Twelve people were injured, two of them children, and one section of the building collapsed. Rescue workers were on the scene and officials expressed fears that the casualty count could rise. Just two days earlier, Russian forces targeted an apartment building in the regional capital, Sumy, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring more than 50. The Sumy region, which borders Russia, has been a frequent target of artillery and drone strikes, with attacks intensifying in recent months. Local authorities in Sumy have ordered the evacuation of 23 towns and villages, affecting around 6,000 people, as the region remains under near-constant threat. Russia's Defense Ministry continues to claim that it targets only military facilities, yet reports from Ukrainian officials and independent media document widespread civilian casualties and destruction of nonmilitary infrastructure. Russia's full-scale invasion, which began on February 24, 2022, has evolved into a prolonged conflict with significant losses on both sides. For Ukraine, the war has meant widespread destruction, over 20,000 civilian deaths according to international estimates, and millions displaced. For Russia, the conflict has brought economic isolation, military losses, and growing internal dissent. The use of ATACMS by Ukraine would reflect both the maturation of its military strategy and the increasing support from Western allies, who have progressively provided more advanced weaponry to counter Russian aggression. However, it also raises questions about the potential for further escalation, as attacks on Russian soil may provoke a harsher response from Moscow.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn8loRK3rhV9T	2024-11-19T08:15:12-08:00	
Europe’s Five Big Powers Commit To Ukraine Regardless Of US Polic...	By Claudia Ciobanu Foreign ministers of the five biggest powers in Europe together with the incoming top EU diplomat and host Poland held talks in Warsaw on Tuesday to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression. 'We were in agreement that imposing on Ukraine peace recipes contrary to its interests or unacceptable socially would have a negative impact on the stability of the country,' Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said after the meeting of Weimar Triangle foreign ministers (Germany, France and Poland) plus Italy, Spain and the UK. 'Any scenarios for finishing the war and putting an end to Russian aggression must be worked out in close cooperation with the Ukrainian government,' Sikorski added. The meeting was called to allay fears that Ukraine would be sidelined once the newly elected US president Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump has repeatedly talked about bringing peace 'in 24 hours' by imposing a solution that would likely be heavily weighted towards Russia. Jitters were also caused by the decision of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to discuss the war with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a one-on-one call last week, the first since the full-scale invasion began. That call has been criticised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, among others. Sikorski was joined in Warsaw by the foreign ministers of Germany (Annalena Baerbock), France (Jean-Noel Barrot), Italy (Antonio Tajani) as well as Kaja Kallas, the future EU high representative for foreign affairs. The foreign ministers of Spain and the UK took part in the talks remotely. Explaining the reasons for organising the meeting, Sikorski said it was prompted by the weekend’s major attack on Ukraine, the largest since last year, as well as by the US presidential election. The meeting in Warsaw also served as an attempt by Poland to preserve its key role in European policymaking on Ukraine after apparently being snubbed last month by Berlin when it held talks on Ukraine with the US, UK and France but not Poland. It was also an opportunity for Sikorski to score a few domestic points ahead of his party’s primary election later this week to choose its presidential candidate for next year. German Foreign Minister Baerbock spoke about the importance of not 'having any breaks in securing the peace in Europe' in the context of uncertainties connected to the election of Trump as the next president of the US. EU countries, she said, 'must strengthen the European pillar of NATO' and 'invest significantly more than 2 per cent of GDP in defence'. She also warned against 'self-fulfilling prophecies', implying that it was too early to tell what a future US administration would do in relation to the war and US financial involvement in European defence. All the foreign ministers were careful to highlight the importance of cooperation with the US for ensuring peace in Europe, regardless of who holds the reins of power in Washington. 'It’s only by having strong transatlantic ties that we can counter the rising threats from Russia and other countries,' Sikorski said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2ZnxnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-19T08:03:57-08:00	
Russia Broadens Conditions For Using Nuclear Weapons	As the war in Ukraine entered its 1,000th day Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine stating that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation supported by a nuclear power is considered a joint attack and could trigger a nuclear response. The proclamation came a day after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons from the U.S. to attack military targets in Russia. When Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked if the revised doctrine was issued in response to the U.S. authorization, he said it was put forth 'in a timely manner' and that Putin wanted it updated to be 'in line with the current situation,' the Associated Press reported. The doctrine states nuclear weapons could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles. It says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation.' It doesn’t specify whether such an attack would definitely be met with a nuclear response. Peskov the aim of the updated policy was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. It also states that Russia could use nuclear weapons if another country attacks ally Belarus. 1,000 days of fighting Both Russia and Ukraine issued statements about the 1,000th day of the war, both vowing that they would continue fighting against each other. The Kremlin said Western support for Kyiv would have no impact on the military campaign. 'The military operation against Kyiv continues,' Peskov said, adding that Western aid 'cannot affect the outcome of our operation. It continues, and will be completed.' Ukraine, meanwhile, said it would continue to resist the Russian invasion. 'Ukraine will never submit to the occupiers, and the Russian military will be punished for violating international law,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. Attack on Russian weapons depot There was no word if long-range U.S. weapons were used in Ukraine’s strike against a large weapons depot near the Russian town of Karachev in the Bryansk region more than 110 miles from the border with Ukraine. Reuters reported that Ukraine often uses domestically produced drones to hit targets deep inside Russia, and in an announcement on Tuesday, the military did not specify which weapons had been used for the strike. 'The destruction of ammunition depots will continue for the army of the Russian occupiers in order to stop the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine,' the Ukrainian military said on the Telegram messaging app. An overnight Russian drone attack in the northeastern Sumy region killed eight people, including one child, Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. The attack on a residential building in the border town of Hlukhiv also wounded 12 people, including two children, Ukraine's national police force said on Telegram. Two high-rise buildings and a hospital were damaged, and more people could be in the rubble. Ukraine's air force said on Tuesday it shot down 51 out of 87 drones launched by Russia overnight. Tear gas detected near front line Also on Tuesday, Ukraine urged action after the international chemical weapons watchdog said banned CS riot control gas, also known as tear gas, had been found in Ukrainian soil samples from the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia has not reacted to the report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which did not assign blame for the chemical. The Chemical Weapons Convention strictly bans the use of riot control agents including CS outside riot control situations when it is used as 'a method of warfare,' Agence France-Presse reported. CS gas causes irritation to the lungs, skin and eyes. Both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons in the conflict, and Ukraine’s Western allies have claimed Moscow has employed banned weapons. 'Russia's use of banned chemicals on the battlefield once again demonstrates Russia's chronic disregard for international law,' a statement from Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. OPCW stressed however that the report did 'not seek to identify the source or origin of the toxic chemical.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn8YXCeLP6-Fg	2024-11-19T08:00:11-08:00

Specifically, Eni’s new HPC system delivers a significant increase from the 70 PFlop/s of HPC4 and HPC5 to over 600 peak PFlop/s of HPC6, representing an increase in computing capacity of an order of magnitude. Based on cutting-edge architecture similar to the most powerful systems worldwide, HPC6 combines CPUs and GPUs in a hybrid configuration, with over 3400 compute nodes and nearly 14,000 GPUs, optimizing both computational performance and energy efficiency. HPC6 is installed in a dedicated area within Eni's Green Data Center, one of the most energy-efficient data centers in Europe among the best for its low carbon footprint. From its start the primary objectives have been operational efficiency and the minimization of environmental impact, placing sustainability at the core of its mission. This goal has been achieved through the implementation of a new liquid cooling system, which can improve energy efficiency by optimizing the absorption of heat generated by the new machine. Eni's Green Data Center enables the company to combine skills, technologies, and diverse business lines to support the energy transition, operating as a globally advanced energy center in Ferrera Erbognone, near Milan. With HPC6, Eni strengthens its leadership in high-performance computing for industrial applications and reaffirms its position as a technology-driven company supporting the energy transition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn3sTEUSXbVxo	2024-11-19T07:52:56-08:00	
United States: Fighting To The Last Ukrainian – OpEd	When Joe Biden leaves office, he will leave as the president with a record that places him amongst the most militaristic of American leaders with responsibility for inflicting suffering and bringing death to possibly the largest number of innocent civilian casualties in this modern era. This is as a result of the wars taking place during his watch in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere. This record will become worse if the bleak outcome of his latest foreign policy decision becomes reality. In what independent observers view as a further attempt by Biden to continue and escalate the war in Ukraine, the lame duck president has authorised Ukraine to use American long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia. In the US, the following response by Congress representative Marjorie Greene has received 2 million views on X and 47,000 likes 'On his way out of office, Joe Biden is dangerously trying to start WW III by authorizing Ukraine the use of U.S. long range missiles into Russia. 'The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems.' -- Marjorie Taylor Green, Congress representative for Georgia, X post, 14 Nov 2024 This decision, allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMs) with their superior range of up to four times more than the current missiles supplied to Ukraine for attacks inside Russia, has been justified with the most flimsy of excuses. Quoting American officials reported to be ‘knowledgeable’ about the matter but obviously designated by the White House to provide justification propaganda, the major policy change is being pitched by western media to the world as a response to North Korean troops reported to be positioned along Ukraine’s northern border. The explanation rings hollow. Since the war began, Russia has not called upon or relied on any non-Russian troops to fight its war. At this late stage when victory appears to be in sight, Putin will want for it to enter into the history books as an exclusive and singlehanded Russian victory against the combined forces of the US, Britain, Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and other allies of the West. It will be foolish and extremely unlikely for Putin to welcome any participation from Russia’s allies in the current battlefield and military endgame in Ukraine. As to the presence of North Koreans in Ukraine, it is possible that there is a small number of them at the frontline. However, South Korea, which has the best intelligence on North Korea, has not been able to confirm that North Korean troops are now engaged in combat as reported by some US and Ukraine officials. Explaining Biden's Last War Hurrah What explains Biden’s last hurrah in US foreign policy is not difficult to understand. Firstly, he is giving way to the late ditch effort by the military-industrial (MIC) and deep state complexes that are key players of US domestic and foreign policy to obstruct the incoming president, Donald Trump, in his plan to end the war. Such a move which Trump has promised to take place within 24 hours after his assumption of office, would obviously adversely impact the windfall profits that the war in Ukraine has generated for the MIC complex. Biden had earlier resisted pressure from Zelensky and Western supporters to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia for fear that this escalation could draw the US and NATO into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. His change of mind at this late hour can also be interpreted in other ways besides his finally giving in to the military and industrial forces working behind the political scene in Washington and Kyiv. Foremost appears to be his personal animosity towards Trump who he condemned in a recent election campaign rally as a threat to democracy and someone that needed to 'be locked up'. Related to that animosity may also be a quest for retaliation against his nemesis fuelled by Kamala Harris’s election loss which many Democrat leaders attribute to Biden’s late withdrawal from the presidential race. Failure by Trump as the new president to stop the war as promised would put Biden’s foreign policy legacy of support for Ukraine in a better light and make Trump the loser in the American history books which Biden is now focused on influencing and rewriting. Earlier in his youth, Biden had shown promise of being anti-war in his sentiment. Like earlier presidents - George W. Bush and Bill Clinton - he was successful in avoiding the draft. According to a report by the US Army Times newspaper which serves active, reserve, national guard and retired US army personne, and analysed the draft dodging strategies of various presidents: 'Biden not only received deferments for his undergraduate days at the University of Delaware, but for three years of law school at Syracuse University. When his education deferments expired in 1968, Biden requested a deferment based on the fact he had asthma as a teenager. He did this in spite of the fact that, according to his own book, he was a star athlete in high school and in college played intramural sports and was a lifeguard in the summer.' -- Dodging and deferring: Trump wasn’t the only POTUS to avoid the draft The report also noted that as soon as he received his asthma deferment, Biden ran for local office and within two years after he would have been discharged from the Army, assuming he was not wounded or killed, he was elected to the Senate. As an outgoing president, Biden clearly has embellished his war record with this latest variant of US foreign policy - that is, of fighting to the last Ukrainian. This recalibration of US foreign policy is also being applied to hotspots such as Gaza and Lebanon in the Middle East and Korea and Taiwan in Asia. Fighting to the last Palestinian, Korean or Taiwanese can be expected as the US continues with its efforts to maintain geo-political dominance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn1sgBTt-8yVC	2024-11-19T07:51:37-08:00	
Trump Kept World Peace, And He’ll Do it Again – OpEd	Amidst the challenges of increasing geopolitical conflicts worldwide, America requires a leader possessing determination, foresight, and a track record of rebuilding stability domestically and internationally. Donald Trump embodies these qualities. His prioritisation of interests through the 'America First' approach alongside a fresh new position on international affairs, most importantly his dovish mantra and rejecting warmongering tendencies, offer a roadmap for economic revitalization within the U.S. and fostering a safer world. Trump didn't just impact the US, he also made his mark on the stage by standing up to countries threatening global and regional stability while working towards peace agreements. Critics of Trump's 'America First' ideology wrongly interpret it as isolationism when, in reality, his focus was on prioritizing America's military interests without disregarding its allies' well-being.He revamped trade deals such as NAFTA (replaced by the USMCA) to enhance protection, for workers and industries while safeguarding intellectual property rights. America fought and won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and established the rules-based order that preserved global stability. This long peace comes with a cost, and all Trump wants is for others to pay their equal burden and fair share for world peace. Trump called on NATO partners to fulfill their defense spending promises so that America's allies also took part in safeguarding security. This action aimed to redistribute responsibilities by reducing the U.S.' heavy burden of NATO defense duties and decreasing its dependence on countries for assistance. Trump's strategies have clearly demonstrated that America's economic strength is pivotal for global well-being. His stances on taxes, commerce, and energy self-sufficiency provide a groundbreaking positive foundation for future positive changes. Trump's tax reductions for corporations prompted investments in manufacturing, and his energy strategies turned the United States into a powerhouse in the energy sector, resulting in job security for workers in energy-intensive sectors and potential economic stability worldwide. Trump's initiatives extended beyond tax reductions; they aim to undo years of offshoring practices and enhance infrastructure while securing energy self-sufficiency for the nation's benefit. Trump won the elections with a resounding and thumping voice of the American people's victory in a powerful message of truth and will. The red wave has retaken the Senate and put the House under Republican control, marking a new era of change for the country. Trump's popular vote gain, not seen since Bush Jr., also marks a new era of change. Democrats warned that Trump and the MAGA movement are hijacking democracy. Now, they must acknowledge the truth: the Trump movement, no matter how much it has been panned by many, is a powerful expression of democracy. The red wave and Donald J. Trump's victory marked the greatest political comeback in history, symbolizing the advent of the prospects of a new world peace and an end to global conflicts. He won more votes with key demographic groups than last time, including Hispanic Americans and younger voters, compared to Harris, who did poorer than Biden with women, urban voters, younger voters, and Hispanics. Sixty percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, further worsened by the soaring inflation. Trump is now seen as the champion of the working class. Why Trump Has Always Been the Clear Choice The economy was booming under the first Trump administration with his low tax and low regulations mantra, and a second Trump administration will see bigger tax cuts that will boost domestic production and create more high paying jobs. In his first four years, stock markets and 401(k) were high. Businesses were easier to form, and jobs were returning. Inflation was almost at its lowest, and the sense of economic optimism and unity from both sides of the aisle was at its highest.Trump saved tens of millions of lives worldwide with Operation Warp Speed, in getting the vaccines ready in record time. Trump helped America build its strongest economy in history. Median household incomes rose to their highest level ever in 2019, while the poverty rate hit an all-time low. Under the Trump Administration, more Americans were employed than ever before, numbered at 160 million, and the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Americans without a high-school diploma all hit record lows, while the Trump 'Blue-Collar Boom' saw wages grow faster for workers than for managers or supervisors. Trump signed the largest relief package in American history to protect workers and families from economic devastation during Covid. The American economy surged back to life within months, seeing record growth and job gains. Trump returned law and order to the American people, and would be tough on crime in the new term. He brought the abortion decision back to the states and overturned Roe v Wade, the first in more than five decades. The pro-life stance started a new opening to save the lives of the unborn. Energy independence was achieved, where reliance is no longer on oil-rich countries in the Middle East. Under his new term, America will soon be an energy dominant country, with common sense utilisation of the vast black gold under the feet of Americans and with the 'drill, baby drill' mantra. In Trump 2.0, the fundamental economic problem plaguing the country will be addressed, starting by cutting energy prices in half within his first year. The appointment of three Supreme Court justices, and hundreds of federal judges, that have been confirmed during Trump 1.0 further sealed his legacy. He also oversaw the greatest transformation in the criminal justice reform, a feat where even Obama failed to pass. Border security was among the best in a very long time, and the greatest tax cut since Reagan has enabled manufacturing jobs to return. The military has been rebuilt, and veterans' welfare and support capacity have been prioritized. The Space Force has been created, providing the US with new space dominance for decades to come. When Biden-Harris took over the leadership, the economy got worse. Trump was right when he predicted, way before the 2020 Elections, that if Biden-Harris were to get elected, energy prices and inflation would be through the roof. 65% of Americans cannot afford to own a home, and 800,000 Americans lost their jobs last year. Instead, 1.2 million non-citizens took those jobs. Energy prices and crime were also through the roof. More than ten thousand manufacturing jobs were lost last month alone, just before the elections. Businesses are leaving because of high taxes and high regulations, and with the tariff in place under Trump 2.0, they will be coming back to America, and new manufacturing bases will sprout in America. Under Trump, the stock market and the economy were better off than before Covid era when he left office. He also reviewed and withdrew from global memberships including Paris Climate Accords that are weakening America and putting it at a disadvantage, mostly in constraining America's economic potential through green and carbon obligations. In contrast, other countries are allowed to have bigger leeway. For years,America was seen to be ripped off by foreign powers. While their cars dominate the American market, other countries are not accepting American cars. Trump's tariff will protect American businesses, get other countries to stop their dumping and market distortion that have obliterated American workers' interests, encourage more companies to shift and start their operations in America, and give new tax cuts to American enterprises. Peace Through Strength and New Advent of Global Peace Trump's America First agenda has been panned by the Democrats and the world over, but it brought unconventional approaches and returns to both America and the world through relative peace and stability. The world is safe because of his peace through strength mantra, which deterred aggression and preserved the rules-based order. Under his watch, no major conflicts or wars happened, and he stopped war-mongering neocons. Biden-Harris' Afghanistan withdrawal with the loss of 13 American soldiers and 85 billion dollars of military equipment left behind led to the perception of America's weakness, with negative ripple effects. Despite the casting of Trump as weakening America's global standing via his treatment of allies and withdrawal from multilateralism and globalism, Trump fixed the cancerous plague that has held America back with smart and common sense foreign policy that has benefitted everyday Americans and rebuilding the military with Space Force, taking care of the veterans and regaining America's military strength. Trump never left a vacuum in global dominance, he strengthened the US position through military and economic rebuilding at home. Most importantly, he is not a typical politician who is part of the system that panders to the military-industrial complex, in which the warmongers and hawks have been having a field day enriching themselves from the various global conflicts. Trump is definitely different, and peace and saving lives have always been his priorities. This is evident even now when warmongers have been left out of his new administration, but the outgoing Biden administration continues to be fixated on global conflicts and just recently approved the first use of US-supplied long-range missiles for Ukraine for strikes inside Russia. While Trump intends to prevent WWIII, the current establishment seems not to want to give Trump an easy transition in terms of global peace and stability. They continue to take a conventional approach to dealing with foreign leaders and viewing conflicts through traditional, outdated lenses and archaic foreign policy trappings. Traditional diplomacy typically focuses on ideological alignment or gradual confidence-building measures and friendshoring efforts. Trump's method is more transactional and direct, with 'win-win' outcomes, a focus on transactional diplomacy, and his willingness to challenge traditional norms in U.S. foreign policy. Traditional U.S. peace efforts often emphasized security guarantees or political agreements, but Trump highlighted economic incentives as foundational to long-term peace. Hopes are highest that Trump will follow through on his quest to prevent WWIII, end the Ukraine war and the conflicts in Gaza and West Asia, prevent new conflicts in East Asia and prevent warmongering hawks from dominating defense and foreign policy, which will trap the world into another endless cycle of wars and conflicts. The choice for the 47th President of the United States has always been clear, as proven by the red wave in the elections, and Trump will signal a new era of rejuvenation and global peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2ZnyiBJ-uV0kw1	2024-11-19T07:50:37-08:00	
The Problem With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – OpEd	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been chosen by president-elect Donald Trump to be Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). From a Catholic perspective, there are serious problems with that choice. First and foremost is Kennedy’s position on abortion. It might be more accurate to say his positions on abortion. For most of his career he has been a staunch supporter of abortion-on-demand, but now he says he favors some restrictions. Kennedy didn’t evolve over the years on this issue. He did so recently when it became apparent that if Trump were to win the election he may land some post in the administration. Being pro-abortion, he obviously reasoned, could be a real problem, especially if he were up for the HHS job. When Kennedy was asked by former ESPN commentator, Sage Steele, whether there should be any limits on abortion, he said no. 'Even if it is full term…I don’t think it’s ever OK…I think we have to leave it with the woman rather than the state.' He didn’t say that ten years ago. He said it in May of this year. It gets worse. Literally three days after the Steele interview, Kennedy saidabortion should be permitted only before viability. There are other issues that should give Catholics pause. In December 2023 he told political commentator Patrick Bet-David that he did not support a ban on 'gender affirming' care for minors. Why? Because he did not 'know enough about it to say that it should be completely illegal,' and he needed 'to look at the data' before making a decision. But guess what? In May he decided he supported a ban on minors receiving 'gender affirming' care. Kennedy not only wants to make marijuana legal nationwide, he wants to legalize some psychedelics. That would presumably include psilocybin (magic mushrooms), the most popular psychedelic in the nation. He believes that there are significant benefits to psychedelics that have not been uncovered because the medical establishment has gone out of its way to prevent that research. Here’s what we know about magic mushrooms. They can cause frightening hallucinations, distorted thinking, impaired concentration, unusual body sensations, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, confusion and emotions ranging from bliss to terror. The fundamental problem with Kennedy is that he lacks a coherent understanding of these issues. He has no overriding philosophical vision. He spent his entire life defending abortion-without-limits, and had no problem justifying puberty blockers, chemical castration and mutilating the genitals of disturbed minors—until he experienced his grand epiphany in May. That must have been quite a month for him. And now he thinks we need to make it easier for Americans to hallucinate. This is Robert F. Kennedy’s vision of health and human services. It’s not ours.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcCg7cL_X2Zn3aW42jO4oa7	2024-11-19T07:48:29-08:00	
Between Activism And Isolationism: What To Expect From Trump’s Mi...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- The not-so-unexpected victory of former president Donald Trump on November 5 has sparked renewed discussion on his foreign policy and how a second term might differ from both his first term and current President Joe Biden’s. This article examines Trump’s potential approach to the Middle East, identifying possible shifts and continuities across key issues shaping the region today. These issues include the Iran-Israel confrontation (centered on the Iranian nuclear program), Arab-Israeli reconciliation (and the future of the Palestinian question), US military presence in Syria and Iraq, and broader efforts to reshape the Middle Eastern order within the context of US-China strategic competition. These topics continue to shape the region’s politics, affecting various state and non-state actors, both regionally and globally. As the dictum goes, 'personnel is policy.' Thus, the scenarios and possibilities discussed here consider the tensions between two core factions within today’s Republican Party: an isolationist faction on the farther right of the party aligned with Trump’s 'America First' vision, and a more activist faction that supports robust American power projection, though not through large-scale ground invasions as seen in Iraq or Afghanistan. These foreign policy strains are not new—they have deep roots within the Republican Party and American politics. For example, as seen with former President George W. Bush’s administration following the 9/11 attacks, domestic or international events can dramatically alter an administration’s course, even if it initially professes significant isolationist leanings. Israel-Iran Confrontation and Iran’s Nuclear Program The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel is currently the most pressing regional issue, with a genuine risk of evolving into an all-out, multi-party, multi-front war. Since Hamas’s October 7 attacks and the subsequent Israeli response in Gaza, the conflict has been on a path of incremental escalation, initially by Iran and, more recently, by Israel. Israel has leveraged the multi-front assaults by Iran’s 'Resistance Axis' since October 7 as justification to break the taboo of launching direct attacks on Iranian soil. Much in terms of the trajectory of Iran and Israel’s confrontation depends on the threat perception, risk calculation and strategic objectives of each side. Iran has been in a mostly reactive position since the Israeli attack on Iranian consulate in Damascus in April. Israel has gained strategic initiative over Iran and is the party that would decide whether, when, how, and where to escalate based on what price it is willing to pay for the ends that it defines for itself. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has jubilantly hailed Trump’s return to the White House, Tehran views the prospect with deep wariness. However, much in the US-Israel-Iran relations depends on the direction of Iran’s nuclear program and whether Iran will be willing to negotiate with a Trump administration. Trump has signaled on several occasions that he does not seek regime change in Tehran and that he wants an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Iranian officials seem to cautiously welcome this approach, aiming to avoid the possibility of war with the United States or Israel and to relieve the devastating sanctions placed on them for decades. Iranian Vice-President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif, a primary advocate of the former Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal on Iran’s side, has indicated that Tehran would enter into talks with Trump if it is treated with 'respect.' However, the question remains: What kind of deal would Iran be able to negotiate? Would it be one that focuses solely on Iran’s nuclear program, and if so, how would it differ from the JCPOA? During his previous term, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA and issued a twelve-point set of conditions for talks with Iran, which included terminating the military dimension of its nuclear program, allowing rigorous and sudden inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, halting Iran’s ballistic missile program, ceasing support for regional proxies like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, and disarming Iraqi militias and integrating them into Iraq’s security forces. It is unclear whether the Trump team would insist on these conditions this time around. However, if they did, it would place Iran in a serious dilemma. Moreover, Iran’s repeated attempts to assassinate Trump in retaliation for his 2020 order to kill Iranian Quds Force General Qassem Soleimani could influence Trump’s personal stance toward Iran, adding another layer of complexity for Tehran. While survival is crucial for the Iranian regime, the form and basis of that survival matter. Without its network of regional militias, ballistic missile capabilities, and a nuclear program under stringent international monitoring, the Islamic Republic would undergo a transformation, appearing significantly weakened to both allies and adversaries. This level of concession could leave Iran vulnerable to external pressures and domestic unrest—the likelihood of which is heightened given the government’s oppressive stance on civil liberties, women’s rights, ethnic minorities, and overall economic mismanagement. Consequently, a deal with Washington along the liens of the 12 points might seem like an act of capitulation for Iran and could prove disastrous, without necessarily guaranteeing the regime’s survival. However, rejecting a deal exposes Iran to the serious risk of escalating Israeli and even US attacks, particularly as its air defenses are now severely compromised following recent Israeli strikes in late October. In short, the Iranian regime is caught between a rock and a hard place. Trump’s policy toward Tehran will also depend on the figures he appoints to key national security and foreign policy roles in institutions like the State Department—especially the person handling the Iran portfolio—the Defense Department, and the National Security Council. Should individuals with strong anti-Islamic Republic views assume these positions, it would be reasonable to expect an aggressive stance from the administration toward Iran. Currently, Florida Senator Marco Rubio is reported to be Trump’s choice to lead the State Department and former State Department Iran envoy Brian Hook is reported to be overseeing the department’s transition. Fox News host Pete Hegseth is Trump’s nominee for Defense Secretary nominee and Congressman Mike Waltz is the nominee for National Security Advisor, while Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is the nominee for US’s UN ambassador role. All these figures are known for tough stances on Iran and strong support for US allies such as Israel. Additionally, Mike Evans, a prominent Evangelical leader and Trump advisor, told Israel’s i24News that president-elect Trump encouraged Israel to target Iran’s energy infrastructure during Biden’s remaining lame-duck period. With Hamas significantly weakened and Hezbollah decapitated, Netanyahu may feel emboldened to launch a comprehensive strike on Iran before or shortly after January 20 to diminish Tehran’s threat to Israel. Overall, while the Trump administration is likely to avoid a direct regime-change policy, it will probably pursue a maximum pressure campaign by imposing new sanctions on key Iranian industries and officials, rigorously enforcing existing sanctions on Iranian oil sales (which have doubled under Biden compared to Trump’s first term), adopting a 'maximum support' approach if domestic unrest occurred in Iran, and potentially backing Israeli strikes on Tehran. The intent would be either to pressure Tehran into a new deal or to punish it severely for refusing one and for its regional behavior. Of Iran’s multi-layered deterrence strategies, only developing a nuclear weapon might shield it against future attacks and possible collapse, given the reduced effectiveness of its Resistance Axis and ballistic missile arsenal. This would certainly depend on Tehran’s threat perception. But with uranium enriched to 60 percent, Iran appears to be now capable of producing weapons-grade, 90-percent-enriched uranium within one to two weeks, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated in July. Despite internal pressure for such a move, whether Tehran will present the world with a nuclear weapon fait accompli—and the timing of such a decision—will be closely monitored by actors in the region and beyond. Taking actual steps toward building a bomb would certainly invite a devastating Israeli (and US) response. And if Tehran manages to secretly build such a bomb, it will prompt even greater sanctions from Washington and its Western, and possibly regional, allies. Abraham Accords 2.0 The Abraham Accords, establishing diplomatic ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan were undoubtedly the most prominent foreign policy achievement and legacy of the first Trump administration. Following years of unsuccessful efforts by the Biden administration, a second Trump administration would likely prioritize securing a similar agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. This would be seen as the culmination of the Abraham Accords, regardless of whether it retains the same title. However, there are significant obstacles to such a deal. Ongoing Israeli military operations and its reluctance thus far to agree on a new governing formula for Palestinian areas in Gaza or Palestinian statehood could hinder the likelihood of an Israeli-Saudi agreement. Without meaningful recognition for Palestinians and without a role for the Gulf states and Egypt, in supporting a future for Gaza and other Palestinian territories, the prospects of an expanded Abraham Accords or an Israeli-Saudi deal would face substantial challenges. Israel appears to favor a compartmentalized approach, distinguishing its relations with the Gulf and Saudi Arabia from the Palestinian question. Saudi Arabia, however, seems to prefer a comprehensive approach, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan recently reiterating the need for a recognized Palestinian state as a precondition for any deal with Israel. Given Saudi Arabia’s leadership role in the Arab and Islamic worlds and its guardianship of Islam’s two holiest sites, the kingdom cannot afford to appear as abandoning the Palestinian cause. As demonstrated by the October 7 attack by Hamas, the Palestinian issue and militant groups remain potent forces that could disrupt any Arab-Israeli deal that overlooks them. Overall, warmer relations and a higher degree of trust between the Republicans and Israel suggest that a deal is more likely under a Trump administration if approached strategically. Trump’s personal style of diplomacy and strong connections with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) may aid in this process. If Jared Kushner returns to a central role in Trump’s Middle East policy, the chances of a comprehensive Saudi-Israeli agreement may increase, given his close relationship with MBS and family ties to Trump. Should an Israeli-Saudi deal prove unachievable—mainly due to Israeli inflexibility on the Palestinian issue—a bilateral Saudi-US security agreement might be the most viable alternative, either in Biden’s final weeks or under a future Trump administration. US Military Deployments in Syria and Iraq Another key issue for the incoming Trump administration in the Middle East will be the ongoing presence of US troops in Syria and Iraq. These forces have faced numerous attacks by pro-Iran militias, and their strategic purpose is frequently questioned in Washington. Given Trump’s emphasis on ending 'endless wars' abroad, he may be tempted to bring these troops home. However, such a decision is easier said than done, as their deployment remains crucial to regional stability and US interests. Syria Syria has become a central arena for entangled regional and global rivalries over the past decade. The country is currently divided into three primary zones, each backed by a major regional or global power. The western part of Syria is dominated by Assad, with the support of Iran, its regional proxies, and Russia. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control the northern and northeastern energy-rich areas with the backing of a 900-strong US military deployment. Northwestern and parts of northern Syria are controlled by various, mainly Islamist groups supported by Turkey. Syria continues to be a hub of Iranian regional activity and a transit point for weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has prompted Israeli airstrikes, particularly since the October 7 attacks. Damascus also has an unresolved territorial dispute with Israel over the Golan Heights, which has been under Israeli control since the 1967 War. Syria was a primary base of the Islamic State (ISIS) and has recently witnessed troubling signs of ISIS resurgence, reminiscent of the group’s rise in the early 2010s. The official rationale for the US military presence in Syria is to prevent the re-emergence of ISIS. Complicating matters further, Syria has become a site of ongoing tension between Turkey and Kurds, as Ankara considers the Kurdish elements within the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which it has been battling for nearly four decades. Crafting a policy toward this complex landscape of regional and global interests is understandably challenging. In 2019, Trump ordered a partial withdrawal of US troops from the border areas between Syria and Turkey, enabling Turkey to launch incursions and occupy significant portions of Kurdish-majority areas previously held by the SDF. It remains to be seen whether a future Trump administration would take a similar approach. Trump ally Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently stated that the president-elect wanted to withdraw the remaining US troops from Syria to avoid them becoming 'cannon fodder' in the event of a regional conflict between the Assad regime and Turkey. While the chances of an all-out war between Assad and Turkey are minimal, a US withdrawal would likely lead to further instability in Syria and result in a loss of critical leverage for the United States in both Syria and the broader region. Although the US military presence in Syria is small, it is strategically vital, yielding significant benefits by monitoring ISIS activity and limiting Iran’s regional expansionist efforts—the latter especially directly bearing on Israel’s security. Pulling out the troops would trigger a bloody struggle by various local and regional contenders for the control; of the SDF territory, sow chaos, and could potentially lead to the escape of hundreds, if not thousands, of captured ISIS elements and their radicalized family members from prisons and camps. Thus, it is not far-fetched to expect that Republican foreign policy segments, more attuned to broader regional geopolitical interests, may push back against Trump’s potential withdrawal and the more isolationist factions within his administration. The outcome of this internal struggle is uncertain, especially given that the composition of the Trump administration is not yet fully known. However, National Security Advisor pick Waltz and State Secretary nominee Rubio on Syria strongly opposed Trump’s troops’ withdrawal from Syria in 2019. Overall, maintaining the partnership with the SDF while addressing Turkish concerns by diversifying the SDF’s composition to include Kurdish and non-Kurdish groups more acceptable to Turkey would better advance the strategic interests of the United States and its allies. Iraq The United States and Iraq continue to share an uneasy relationship more than two decades after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s Baath regime and the rise of the current political order in the country. The growing dominance of pro-Iran groups within Baghdad’s state institutions has strained this relationship further. Groups straddling both official Iraqi security and political institutions and the so-called Iran-led Resistance Axis continue to attack US forces in Iraq and Syria as part of Iran’s broader strategy to undermine US regional influence. This has placed Iraq and the United States in a murky dynamic, where they are neither true allies nor adversaries, despite the Strategic Framework Agreement they signed in 2008. Approximately 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq, advising Iraqi security forces on the critical mission of ensuring ISIS’s defeat. Iraq’s significance has grown amid the recent regional conflict since the October 7 attacks, as Iran-backed militias have targeted both Israel and US forces—with dozens of attacks on Israel in the past six weeks. These actions contradict Iraq’s official stance, which seeks to avoid becoming entangled in the conflict. Recently, Iraqi and US officials reached an agreement for US forces to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2026, with a small contingent remaining in the Kurdistan Region during the last year of this agreement to support the mission in neighboring Syria. This agreement awaits final approval from the US government. For Iraq, the priority is to see US troops depart and to strengthen economic and bilateral security ties beyond the anti-ISIS global coalition framework. The incoming Trump administration may find it tempting to withdraw US troops from Iraq either prematurely or in accordance with the scheduled plan. Or depending on the course of regional events and Iraq’s behavior in the context of the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, it might decide to keep troops in Iraq. Ongoing attacks on Israel could potentially make Iraq a target for the Israeli military, as has occurred with other members of the Iran-backed axis in Lebanon and Yemen. Washington has reportedly restrained Israel from adding Iraq to its list of targets, though this could change depending on US Middle East policy (under Biden or Trump) or the evolving calculations of Netanyahu’s government and Iran’s broader behavior. Iraq may also face sanctions due to militia activities, the continued smuggling of US-provided dollars to Iran and its proxies, and an Iraqi judicial arrest warrant for Trump following the killing of Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), the umbrella group for predominantly Iran-backed factions. The possibility of Washington revoking exemptions that allow Iraq to purchase Iranian natural gas for its power plants is a tangible prospect, especially as part of its anticipated maximum pressure strategy against Iran. Washington’s best course of action regarding Iraq may be to leverage current regional tensions to pressure the Iraqi government toward meaningful security sector reforms. This could involve curbing the influence of Iran-backed armed factions and further integrating the PMF into the state’s military-security structure. The United States could also alternatively maintain a long-term military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan to support the Syria mission, broader regional interests, and the containment of a resurgent jihadi threat. Washington’s fatigue with Iraq should not overshadow prudent policymaking concerning the challenges and opportunities the country presents. The Middle East in a Moment of Global Rivalries The desire to reduce US engagement in the Middle East dates back to former president Richard Nixon’s administration, nearly half a century ago. This aspiration continued under both Trump and Biden, yet the region continues to demand US attention. Although US policymakers have argued for a pivot to East Asia and focusing more energy on Eastern Europe to counter China and Russia, the Middle East remains integral to global rivalries. China has made substantial inroads through economic, energy, and trade partnerships and flexed its diplomatic clout by brokering the 2023 Iran-Saudi deal. The region is also central to global trade routes, as evidenced by initiatives like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to integrate the region’s vast energy resources. From the perspective of some policymakers in Washington, the Abraham Accords and a surprising weakening of Iran and its Axis of Resistance in recent months offer a unique opportunity to reshape the regional order in alignment with US priorities. For Washington to maintain its influence, it would feel compelled to continue strengthening its allies, which necessitates some level of military presence or involvement. A leadership void due to Washington’s disengagement would likely invite interventions by China or Russia, or intensify regional rivalries among players like Israel, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Turkey, and Iran. Actors like Iran tend to design their policies in the region or their support for Russia against Ukraine as part of a broader strategy to erode US influence and challenge the US-dominated global order. Viewing the region through this 'big picture' lens is essential to understanding the broader significance of regional events and the stakes involved. Interpreted cautiously, despite Trump’s professed preference against deploying military power or involvement in global conflicts/crises, the selection of individuals for key foreign policy and national security roles suggests a lean toward a more engaged US presence in the region than retreat. This indicates continuity in the use of American power and influence, support for Israel, and harsher policy toward Iran, much like Trump’s first term. Nevertheless, future US policy could still reflect isolationist tendencies, both due to Trump and the general American public’s hesitation regarding troop deployments and overseas interventions. The future of US policy in the Middle East will likely reflect a struggle between activist and isolationist inclinations within the Trump administration and the Republican foreign policy establishment writ large. Neither side is likely to gain full control, suggesting US Middle East policy will likely experience shifts in both directions. About the author: Mohammed A.

Challenge Before Trump As Russia-China-North Korea Axis Takes Sha...	The 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty, or the mutual defence treaty signed between Russia and North Korea in June 2024 in Pyongyang during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit includes a clause committing the two states to providing military support 'without delay' if either is attacked. This Russia-North Korea bonhomie has drawn Ukraine as a proxy battlefield for Korean Peninsula tensions. The ratification of the security treaty by the Russian Parliament has led the Ukraine crisis into a hazardous new phase. Recent intelligence reports from the US revealed that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid fight against Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. The larger implications are on issues of disruptive security, governance, and technological risks that threaten peace, growth, and opportunity in the Indo-Pacific region, with added focus on Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. As reported in the New York Times, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman at the White House, said North Korea had sent at least 3,000 soldiers into training sites in eastern Russia between early- to mid-October 2024. These soldiers believed to have travelled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. The soldiers then travelled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in Eastern Russia, where they are currently believed to be undergoing training. Though there is no information as of now if these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. The participation of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s war in Ukraine, though a dramatic move, also could mean a sign of Russia’s weakness, not strength, as Russia that boasts of a mighty military power had to depend on a tiny new allay for its war in Ukraine. Viewed differently, this unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is indeed a matter of worry as the security implications in Europe and the Indo-Pacific could be huge. Being concerned about this new twist as the Korean Peninsula and Inter-Korean issue has escalated further following the Russia-North Korea bonhomie, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador and urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean soldiers from Russia. Interestingly, the Kremlin has denied the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia despite satellite pictures testify to the contrary. Since the security environment centring on inter-Korean relations in the Korean Peninsula is already fragile and volatile, the deployment of third-party ground forces risks transforming the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into even more of a global security crisis. Following the signing of a comprehensive defence treaty between Russia and North Korea in June 2024, North Korea started supplying ammunition to Russia. Bilateral ties between the two soon developed into a more sustained partnership. South Korea’s intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that dozens of North Korean officers and one prominent missile development expert, Kim Jong-sik, travelled to Russian frontline positions providing direct guidance on using Pyongyang’s weaponry to Moscow’s forces. The presence of these officers marks North Korea’s significant shift from arms supplier to active participant. This collaboration offers mutual benefits. Due to the prolonged war, Russia badly needed munitions and potential manpower from North Korea. In the three-year conflict, Russia has the casualty of between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers and therefore it is expected that Russia would induct around 10,000 troops from North Korea by December 2024. Putin is aware that North Korea has a massive conventional military, with 1.3 million active soldiers and an additional 7.6 million on reserve, almost a third of its population. North Korean soldiers are experienced and serving a mandatory eight to ten years but their actual capabilities is less known since the country remains isolated. It is also believed despite bold claims, North Korea possess outdated weapons systems. This is because an estimated half of the KN-23 missiles used by Russia believed to have exploded midair. This offers crucial insights to how sophisticated are North Korea’s military technological capabilities. Pyongyang’s adversaries such as the US and South Korea are obviously aware of this. There are other adverse consequences that Kim Jong-un needs to factor in. The distressed member of troops deployed to the frontlines would be more miserable now, though they continue to stay under domestic control and have no option than to suffer. Also, if some North Korean troops decide to use this opportunity to defect or claim exceptional considerations if captured as prisons of war, human rights issue can make international highlights. The world know that the Kim regime takes defection as a serious affront and issues strict punishments, including imprisonment of family members or even execution for some returned defectors. Obviously South Korea is alarmed as it would have reason to feel that North Korea’s military involvement in Ukraine could both legitimise Pyongyang’s weapons program and provide combat experience that could threaten South Korean security. Seoul also contends that North Korean troops in Ukraine violate UN precedents, including recent UN General Assembly resolutions condemning military cooperation with Russia. There is indeed a danger that the participation of a third nation in Ukraine conflict risks triggering a global war, given the complex web of security alliances and the potential for escalation beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia however counters that the current cooperation between Russia and North Korea does not run counter to the security interests of South Korea and that such cooperation is being realized within the framework of international law. The US considers the involvement of North Korean troops in the Ukraine conflict on Russia’s behalf as a major escalation and shall have serious impact not only in Europe but in the Indo-Pacific as well. The Russia-North Korea defence deal signals a fundamental shift in global power dynamics. Japan expresses concern Japan too is concerned about the deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia as worrying, given its impact on the security of the region surrounding Japan. So, the situation is more complicated by the day and risk threshold is feared to be breached any time. During his visit to Ukraine on 16-17 November, Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his counterpart Andrii Sybiha, and expressed grave concerns about the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia in its war against Ukraine and promised Japan’s unwavering stance of being with Ukraine in the conflict, now in its third year. As a quid pro quo, Russia seems to be transferring missile and nuclear technologies to North Korea. Iwaya’s visit symbolised the close relationship between the two countries. Zelenskyy expressed appreciation for the support Japan provided to Ukraine to the tune of $12 billion (1.85 trillion yen). The latest assistance from Japan consisted of electrical equipment items to help Ukrainians through the cold winter months, when power shortages are feared. The items, including 32 generators, were to be given to the cities of Kharkiv and Odesa through the UNDP and the JICA. Ukraine lost about 60 per cent of its power generation capacity due to Russian attacks on infrastructure facilities from March 2024. Iwaya was the first minister of the Ishiba Cabinet to visit Ukraine and the third Jaoanese foreign minister to travel to the country after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. No doubt, Zelenskyy called Japan a true leader in Asia in terms of protecting the rules-based international order as well as international order as well as human lives. Reaction of US State Department The US State Department reacted by saying that North Korea’s involvement in Russia’s war against Ukraine causes 'great concern' and 'consternation' for the Indo-Pacific. The State Department statement underscored cooperation with South Korea, Japan and other countries in addressing the issue. The engagement of North Korean troops in combat operations in Russia’s western front-line Kursk region runs risk of the Ukraine war developing into a larger war. The US is working collaboratively with its partners in Japan and South Korea on this. While confirming the North Korean troops already in the combat zone, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Brussels that the deployment calls fir a 'firm' response. The larger concern is that the Russia-North Korea military partnership will have broad security implications for Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the world. South Korea’s Response South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol said that his country would 'implement appropriate effective measures' in response to North Korean troops being deployed to fight for Russia in Ukraine. At the same time, Yoon is making 'diplomatic efforts' with Russia. Yoon appears to be adjusting his position on sending Ukraine weapons in light of Donald Trump being elected US president. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. One other option before Yoon is to maintain 'strategic dialogue' with Beijing even as he called on Beijing to play a responsible role in contributing to stability on the Korean Peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Earlier, South Korea’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, had confirmed that North Korean troops were deployed to Russia and engaged in combat in Ukraine. This was a clear departure from his earlier announcement of sending lethal weapons to Ukraine even as he weigh what policy response US President-elect Trump would adopt on this issue. Though China has leverage both with Russia and North Korea, there has been a clear reluctance on Beijing’s part to be grouped together with Russia and North Korea. Such a situation poses bigger challenge to other stakeholders to woo China to play its card on the Ukraine war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUI9O83651OiB	2024-11-18T17:18:03-08:00	
Ron Paul: If Trump Didn’t Send Musk To Talk With The Iranians…He ...	One of the most encouraging and promising things President-elect Trump said in his post-election acceptance speech was, 'I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars…' We all understand that campaign promises often have a short shelf life after the election is over, but the Trump campaign’s repeated talk of peace over war at least demonstrates that he finds it a winning point to make to American voters. Will that talk of peace turn into action in the second Trump presidency, especially with the hawks he has named to senior foreign policy positions in his incoming Administration? It is hard to say, but last week’s report that he sent Elon Musk to meet with the Iranian Ambassador to the UN would be a good sign if true. Iran has denied that any such meeting took place, and with rumors swirling of Trump talks with Putin and other world leaders it may just be a media creation. But even if it is not true that Trump sent Musk to meet with the Iranians it would be a good idea to do so. Why Musk? Because Musk is not expected to take on a formal role in the incoming Trump Administration he can be seen as an informal advisor and friend of the President-elect. Plus, as a businessman Elon Musk speaks a different language than government diplomats. Why meet with the Iranians? What’s there to talk about? One important topic to bring up would be claims made by Biden’s FBI that there was an Iranian plot to assassinate then-candidate Trump. As many commentators including former CIA analyst Larry Johnson have asserted, the plot as outlined in the FBI indictment seems improbable. Is it possible that deep state hawks cooked up this alleged plot to guarantee that once taking office President Trump would not be tempted to open to Iran? There is a history of terror plots cooked up by the FBI so, sadly, this cannot be discounted. Does that mean that Iranian denials should be trusted? Of course not. But it is worth discussing. It is widely expected that in his second term President Trump will return to the 'maximum pressure' policy of his first Administration. That would be a mistake. Trump will not be stepping into the same world when he steps back into the White House. More than ever, the proxy war in Ukraine has demonstrated the futility of sanctions and pressure as a tool of foreign policy. The countries under US sanctions have increasingly joined together and formed their own pathways to trade and diplomacy without the US. In other words, we did not isolate Russia, China, and Iran with our sanctions upon sanctions. We isolated ourselves. We are seeing this clearly with the emergence of organizations such as BRICS. A more prosperous America requires more foreign trade, not less. Frédéric Bastiat is quoted as saying, 'When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will.' We have already seen too much of that lately. Someone wrote recently that if only Nixon could go to China, perhaps only Trump can go to Iran. Making peace with Iran would be an achievement that would reverberate across the Middle East and beyond. It would even benefit Israel to have the current near state of war with Iran turned down. War destroys, peace builds. Let’s hope for a new approach.

Khamenei’s Succession Remarks Cause Turmoil Within Iran’s Regime ...	On November 7, Iranian regime supreme leader Ali Khamanei met with the Assembly of Experts and discussed plans for his successor. 'The Assembly of Experts, as defined in our Constitution, is one of the most revolutionary institutions of the Islamic Republic,' he said. 'Its significance lies in its unique responsibility to select the nation’s leader. This readiness to fulfill that role must always be maintained.' One day after Khamenei’s remarks to the Assembly of Experts, where he emphasized the need for their readiness to select the next Supreme Leader, Mohammad Bagher Heydari Kashani, a member of the Assembly, described both the speech and the atmosphere as such: 'We held our breath. He gave explicit orders for the Assembly to act swiftly and decisively, without hesitation, to appoint the next leader in accordance with constitutional guidelines… The mere thought of the Leader’s absence moved some members to tears; they couldn’t hold back their emotions at the possibility of the Supreme Leader’s martyrdom.' These remarks sparked widespread controversy within the regime and surfaced in Friday prayer sermons on November 15 across various cities. Several of Khamenei’s appointees spoke on the issue, their conflicting statements revealing the confusion and anxiety caused by the anticipation of Khamenei’s potential demise at the highest levels of the regime. During Friday prayers in Shahrekord, Abdollah Keyvani, another member of the Assembly of Experts, outright denied Heydari’s account: 'Someone said the members of the Assembly cried… That’s not true; there was laughter, joy, and a sense of empowerment in the session. We were delighted, but there weren’t even tears of joy. The claim that the Leader directed the Assembly to discuss the next Supreme Leader is completely untrue.' In Isfahan, Abolhassan Mahdavi, Khamenei’s representative and the Friday prayer leader in the city, remarked, 'Khamenei’s statement that the Assembly should identify suitable candidates for leadership in case of emergency isn’t new; I’ve heard him mention this about 17 or 18 times over the past 20 years.' He continued, 'There is a committee within the Assembly of Experts responsible for identifying all individuals qualified for leadership—this extends beyond Iran, as the concept of ‘Velayat-e Faqih’ transcends borders. This committee works under strict confidentiality, and three members have been chosen to securely hold the names of potential candidates.' Despite the secrecy, reports circulating in the media and on social networks claim that the three confidential candidates include Khamenei’s son Mojtaba, who is said to control the IRGC, particularly its intelligence organization. The second is Alireza A’rafi, head of the seminaries and former leader of Al-Mustafa International University, known for recruiting and training overseas operatives. The third is Mohammad Mehdi Mirbagheri, a cleric reportedly regarded as the spiritual leader of the 'Paydari' faction. In another example of the controversy stirred by Khamenei’s remarks on November 7, Hossein Shafiei Darabi, the Friday prayer leader of Sari, said on November 15, 'The Thursday meeting between the Supreme Leader and the Assembly of Experts provoked reactions from the enemies [i.e., the oppressed society]. They sharpened their tongues and pens, speculating about what might happen. Don’t think that if something unfortunate befalls the Leader, you [the people] will benefit!' Although Mahdavi in Isfahan claimed to have heard Khamenei discuss the need to identify a successor 17 or 18 times over the past 20 years, his comments indicate that previous mentions did not provoke such strong reactions or turmoil within the regime. This current wave of responses, evident in the Friday sermons, underscores both Khamenei’s fragile condition and the severe crisis gripping the regime amidst its challenges—essentially a 'succession crisis' within the regime.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUN0T_ociwS8j	2024-11-18T17:16:11-08:00	
The Indian Navy: A Resident Power In Indian Ocean And Rising Lead...	The Indian Navy stands at the crossroads of a transformative era, where global power dynamics and maritime security imperatives converge in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and the Indo-Pacific. As a resident power in the IOR and an emerging leader in the broader maritime domain, the Navy reflects India’s strategic aspirations to ensure a stable, rules-based maritime order. Against the backdrop of Cold War 2.0 and an increasingly contested Indo-Pacific, the Indian Navy is crafting a new legacy—one that blends operational capability with diplomatic finesse to address complex 21st-century challenges. From Coastal Defense to Strategic Power: The Indian Navy’s Evolution Historical Roots and Geopolitical Awakening India’s maritime heritage is intertwined with its history of trade and cultural exchange. Yet, it was the post-independence era that catalyzed a shift from viewing the ocean as a commercial artery to recognizing its strategic potential. Early investments in naval infrastructure laid the groundwork for a force that would eventually evolve into a blue-water navy capable of influencing events far beyond India’s shores. The Emergence of SAGAR and Regional Ambitions The turning point in India’s maritime strategy came with the introduction of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) in 2015. This policy articulated a vision for an inclusive and cooperative approach to maritime security, positioning India as a stabilizing force in the IOR. SAGAR encapsulates India’s role as a net-security provider and emphasizes economic growth and collective prosperity in the region. Building Regional Leadership Through Multilateralism The Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) India has adeptly used platforms like the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) to solidify its role as a regional leader. Bringing together littoral states, IONS addresses shared challenges such as piracy, climate change, and illegal fishing, fostering an environment of trust and collective action. This approach highlights India’s commitment to building partnerships rather than hierarchies. Operational Excellence: Cementing the Role of Net-Security Provider Defending Maritime Lanes The Indian Navy’s operational successes demonstrate its ability to counter both traditional and non-traditional threats. Notable missions include: Counter-Piracy Operations: In January 2024, the Navy’s elite MARCOS thwarted the hijacking of the MV Leela Norfolk in the North Arabian Sea. Similarly, the interception of the Iranian vessel Iman and the rescue of 17 crew members from Somali pirates spotlighted its proficiency in high-stakes operations. Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR): From its response to the 2004 tsunami to delivering water to the Maldives during its 2014 water crisis, all the way to its medical assitance during the pandemic, the Navy has repeatedly proven its role as a force for good, enhancing India’s diplomatic and humanitarian reputation. First-Responder in Regional Crises India’s readiness to act as a first responder in regional emergencies solidifies its role as a dependable partner. Deployments such as the 2024 mobilization of 20 ships and 5,000 personnel to counter maritime threats highlight the Navy’s capability to respond swiftly and effectively while fostering goodwill among neighboring nations. Expanding Horizons: The Indian Navy in the Indo-Pacific Naval Diplomacy: Building Bridges and Projecting Power India’s pivot to the Indo-Pacific reflects its recognition of this region as the fulcrum of global power. The Navy’s goodwill visits and joint exercises have emerged as critical tools in shaping perceptions and forging partnerships: In 2024, the Eastern Fleet’s visits to Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines signalled India’s intent to deepen ties with Southeast Asia. These visits often coincide with heightened regional tensions, demonstrating India’s commitment to ensuring stability while subtly countering China’s assertive manoeuvres. Strengthening Alliances Through Multilateral Exercises Participation in multilateral exercises like Malabar, alongside the United States, Japan, and Australia, exemplifies India’s commitment to collaborative security. Such exercises enhance operational interoperability while reinforcing India’s image as a key player in the Indo-Pacific security architecture. Navigating the Complexity of Great Power Competition Countering China’s Expanding Influence China’s maritime strategies, from its String of Pearls initiative to its militarization of the South China Sea, present a significant challenge to India’s maritime interests. The Indian Navy’s response is multifaceted: Modernization: The induction of INS Vikrant, India’s indigenously built aircraft carrier, and Project 75I to expand the submarine fleet highlight India’s focus on bolstering its capabilities. Strategic Alignments: Partnerships with nations like France, Australia, and Japan reflect a deliberate strategy to counterbalance China’s regional influence. Balancing Relations Amid U.S.-China Rivalry As a cornerstone of the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy, India enjoys strengthened ties with Washington. However, its emphasis on strategic autonomy necessitates a careful balancing act, ensuring that partnerships with the U.S. do not compromise its broader diplomatic relationships, including with China. Harnessing Opportunities for Leadership Leveraging Technology for Maritime Superiority To maintain its operational edge, the Navy is investing in advanced technologies such as AI-driven surveillance systems and unmanned underwater vehicles. Collaborations with technologically advanced naval powers offer avenues for capacity-building and innovation. Economic Diplomacy and Connectivity Initiatives like the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) exemplify the convergence of India’s strategic and economic objectives. As an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the AAGC reinforces India’s commitment to fostering inclusive regional development. Conclusion: Charting India’s Maritime Destiny The Indian Navy’s evolution from a coastal defense force to a proactive player in the Indo-Pacific shows India’s strategic resolve in an era of shifting global power. As the IOR and Indo-Pacific become central to 21st-century geopolitics, India’s maritime strategy reflects a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead. By balancing ambition with pragmatism, the Navy is positioning itself to be a force that defends India’s maritime interests and contributes to global stability. Whether through its role as a net-security provider in the IOR or its proactive engagement in the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Navy embodies a vision of cooperation, innovation, and resilience. As great power competition intensifies and the Indo-Pacific’s importance grows, the question remains: Can India sustain its momentum and emerge as a decisive maritime leader? The coming years will reveal the extent of India’s maritime rise—and its implications for the global order.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUETbWctOpbo2	2024-11-18T17:15:19-08:00	
US’ Stake In Philippine Mid-Term Elections – Analysis	Donald Trump’s comeback to the White House after winning the US Presidential election in November 2024 may simply sustain the long-standing US-Philippine relations, the longest in Southeast Asia since colonial times. As US Ambassador to the Philippines, MaryKay Carlson, confidently confirmed that the two countries 'will remain steadfast friends and iron-clad allies as well as partners in prosperity' In Trump’s previous presidency (2017-2021), US-Philippine had remarkable dynamics affecting regional stability, bilateral security cooperation, and economic ties. As US’s strategic ally in Asia, particulary Southeast Asia (SEA), Analysts surmise that Trump 2.0 will withstand US-Philippine relations ultimately to check on China’s military and economic domination of Asia. Indisputably, the US has a significant concern over the outcome of the Philippine mid-term 2025 elections as it will roughly define the future of US strategic geopolitical role in the Indo-Pacific region with its 'dependable' ally in the next three (3) years or up until the end of President Marcos Jr. six (6)-year term, and until Trump concludes his second term in office in 2028. The Philippine 2025 elections The Philippine 2025 election will determine who would occupy the over 18,000 positions, including 12 Senate seats, 316 seats in the House of Representatives (HoR) comprising representatives of legislative districts and party-list groups, local executives and legislators, and members of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) parliament. The politicians will ascertain the configuration of the Philippine Congress (Philippine Senate and HoR), the institution which influences the country’s foreign policy and sanctions defense programmes on the one hand, and regional as well local government bodies’ acting as collective institutions at the grassroot level to organize and mobilize local and popular boost to national policies and international commitments on the other hand. In as much as key legislators of the Philippine Senate and the HoR are mandated to frame and adopt laws and policies of national and international significance, it is imperative to the US to ensure that legislators closely conform with US foreign policy interest in the country as well as in the region, or offer less essential impediments or feeble resistance to US pursuit for power, security, and wealth in SEA. Geopolitical implications: The Mutual Defense Treaty and military cooperation agreements As a former colony of the US for 50 years and tied to a neocolonial relationship in the past 78 years US-sponsored independence in 1946, the Philippines as a major non-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) US ally plays a key role especially where US foreign policy is increasingly focused over the growing influence of the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC). Equally, the country’s geographical position in the region is crucial for maintaining US’s presence particularly in projecting its power in the South China Sea (SCS), where territorial disputes between the country and PRC have escalated in recent years. Moreover, the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between the two (2) countries secured them militarily to support each other if one party is a victim of an armed attack on its 'metropolitan territory' (Art V of MDT), which by definition does not refer to territories under dispute. Addititionally, any counter-attack is not necessaritly automatic nor military in nature on the part of the US as the latter is required to invoke Art IV of the MDT: 'Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall be immediately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.' Given that PRC and Russia are permanent members of UN Security Council, they can easily exercise their veto power to annul any attempt for US to launch any military attack against China. Besides, military cooperation with the Philippines is indeed paramount to the US more than ever before especially with the termination of the 1947 US-Philippine Military Bases Agreement (MBA) in 1992 and with the new geopolitical landscape in East Asia dominated by the emerging regional rivalry between China and the US. The new strategic reality has been driven by China’s economic rise against backdrop of the US’s 'rebalancing' foreign policy in Asia and its relative economic decline. Also known as 'pivot to Asia,' the American military and diplomatic 'pivot,' or 'rebalance,' toward Asia became a popular buzzword after then US State Secretary Hillary Clinton first announced it at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 2010 in Hanoi and subsequently authored 'America's Pacific Century,' in Foreign Policy (2013). Pivot to Asia is a shift in the focus of foreign policy from the Middle East to the Far East to try to balance the growing influence of China and threats of North Korea. While essentially diplomatic and economic in nature (Graham 2013), the catalyst for the pivot was not only of reduced American regional power but the more assertive Chinese approach and actions, especially in the SCS disputes. This has reignited US involvement in the region; it is not waiting to be reduced to sub-primacy in the region as a result of what some have dubbed Chinese ‘domination by stealth.’ The US and some of its Asian ardent allies perceive China as a peril more than a partner in global development. China’s growing geopolitical importance has prompted US to strengthen its position, via balancing and engaging with China. In the period of 'pivot to Asia' and post-bases era, US-Philippine security relations has broadened and extended to Philippine politics. US’s geopolitical strategic interest makes it vital that the 2025 election produces politicians and leaders who continually endorse and commit themselves to key standing military cooperation agreements forged between the two states especially the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Implemented in 1999, the VFA paved the way to a series of uninterrupted annual conduct of Balikatan('shoulder-to-shoulder') military exercises, notables in 2001, 2016, 2022, 2023, and 2024, between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the US military. Although the first Balikatan military exercise held in 1991, a year prior to the closure of the US bases in the Philippines in 1992, and before the adoption of the VFA, was then under the MDT, the training exercises and war games have apparently been an important fixture of US-Philippine military-civil security relations. Balikatan has been designed to strengthen bilateral interoperability, capabilities, test air and missile defense systems, increase awareness of maritime security, trust and cooperation. The near cancellation of the VFA in 2020 by then President Duterte as Philippine foreign policy, and during President Trump’s first term, shifted towards China and away from the US is a testament that political leadership has direct impact on the complexion of the country’s foreign policy. Apart from the VFA, the country adopted the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) as a supplemental agreement to two previous accords – the 1951 MDT and 1998 VFA. The ten-year EDCA deal allows the U.S. to have a strengthened presence in the Philippines. This Agreement was however challenged by civil society organizations and legal experts before the Philippine Supreme Court (PSC) as it tolerates US to rotate its troops in the Philippines for an extended stay and consents it to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases for both US and Philippine armed forces. While opposition groups and parties argue that EDCA contravenes the Philippine constitutional provision on the establishment of a permanent foreign military base, the PSC ruled otherwise and with finality that EDCA is constitutional in its 2016 decision. The slow implementation of EDCA during then-President Duterte’s term (June 2016-June 2022) was willfully done as US is disdained by Duterte who is partial to China’s interest. Notwithstanding, the US and the Philippines agreed to have five (5) EDCA sites or military bases for the American troops in 2016, namely: Antonio Bautista Air Base (Palawan); Basa Air Base (Pampanga); Benito Ebuen Air Base (Cebu); Fort Magsaysay (Pampanga); and Lumbia Airport (Cagayan de Oro). With the shift of foreign policy that caters to the US interest, now President Marcos Jr., expanded the EDCA sites, covering four (4) more new bases in 2023, a year after he assumed the presidency. Additional sites are situated in north Luzon facing Taiwan (Republic of China), three, and one in Palawan facing the SCS. These are: Camp Melchora Dela Cruz (Gamu, Isabela); Lal-lo Airport ( Lal-lo, Cagayan); Naval Base Camilo Osias (Santa Ana, Cagayan); and Balabac Island (Palawan). The unilateral selection and identification of EDCA bases without the participation of people on the ground has been adversely received by local government officials. The governors of the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan were collectively offended by the national government’s choice of their provinces as EDCA armed bases as they become potential magnets of attack by Chinese missiles and nuclear attacks, and be caught at the crossfire of US and China armed rivaly in the region. Civil society organizations and groups also raised the alarm of wanton violation of human rights and confiscation of lands from indigenous peoples as a consequence of hosting EDCA military activities and training. Understandably, the non-participation of local government and community leaders in the political process of charting their future in a large-scale project like the EDCA military and civil scheme will not only isolate the program from the people but also produce adversarial relations between national and international actors on the one hand, and local government and community on the other hand. China’s economic growth It is argued moreover that US geopolitical interest in the region is intricately linked and cannot be disassociated with its economic goals. The US as a global political power no longer exercises sole dominion in Southeast Asia. Over the last two (2) decades, the PRC has become the main trading partner for most Asian nations replacing the historic primacy of Asian linkages with the US and the West. China’s economic rise and success did not only win the admiration of Southeast Asian countries, but also helped Beijing establish strong trade and financial ties with them. In Lowy Institute’s 2023 report (Patton and Sato 2023) it concludes that China has been more influential than the US using a variety of indicators such as regional affect across four categories: economic relationships, defense networks, diplomatic influence, and cultural influence. Of the ten (10) Association Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the U.S. is the most influential power in only two: the Philippines, which is a U.S. treaty ally, and Singapore, which is a staunch U.S. partner Similarly, in a 2023 study by the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore found that a majority of respondents in a poll found that China was now the most dominant economic and political-strategic power in Southeast Asia. Given China's growing economic presence in the region as well as in the Philippines, the US is keen on offering a counterbalance. By increasing trade, investment, and development assistance, the US aims to offer the Philippines an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments. This is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the Philippines remains open to American businesses and geopolitical interests. In May 2022, the Philippines and the US joined 12 other partners to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). The Philippines and the US look forward to strengthening economic partnership on: trade; supply chains; clean energy, decarbonization, and infrastructure; and tax and anti-corruption. And more through the Global Infrastructure and Investment (GIP) in support of IPEF economies, human capital, and sustainability goals. In terms of trade and investment, US-Philippine relations are relatively strong -- $22.6 billion in total goods trade in 2023 and an estimated $10.6 billion in trade in services in 2022. The US is also the country’s largest export market and is one of the country’s largest foreign investors. In 2024, the US Commerce Secretary brought 22 U.S. companies to the Philippines to explore commercial opportunities, resulting in US1 billion in investment pledges. These economic momenta have to be built further and expanded towards the conclusion of President Marcos Jr.’s term in 2028 as well as Trump’s first term in office. Having elected US-oriented candidates and/or politicians who make decisions that impact on labour laws, education, transportation, trade, and taxes will ensure that policies and regulations with national application protect and safeguard US capital and investments as well as guarantee that multi-national corporations (MNCs) have undue advantage. Any shift in the current business environment which will be unconducive to US economic and commercial interest would be deeply concerning and troubling to US investors as this may affect their business and commercial future in the country. Summary Given U.S.’s geopolitical interest in the region, the Philippine mid-term elections is highly significant to warrant its possible intervention. U.S.’s keen concern is driven by strategic, economic, security, and diplomatic reasons. The Philippines plays a crucial role in the U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy, and the outcome of these elections could have significant implications on the assertion of the Philippine right to self-determinaion as a sovereign and independent state on the one hand and the US geopolitical interest in the region on the other hand. Leaders elected in 2025 will shape the Philippines’ foreign policy and its alignment with either U.S.-led alliances or with China's sphere of influence. The U.S. may view these elections as a way to support candidates and policies that align with its vision for a 'free and open Indo-Pacific.' The results of the 2025 midterm elections will also help shape the 2028 presidential race. Politicians seeking higher office in 2028 will use this election to build momentum and expand their influence. President Marcos Jr.s’ declaration in his 2023 State of the Nation Address (SONA): 'Our independent foreign policy – a friend to all and enemy of none – has proven effective' is obviously out of touch of the reality as his foreign policy is neither independent nor all-embracing.

Is America Turning Fascist? – OpEd	By Vincent Cook On October 25, ABC News published the results of a survey of 2,392 registered voters where 44 percent of the respondents said that Donald Trump is a fascist, while 23 percent said that Kamala Harris is a fascist. There was even a 5 percent overlap between the two groups—respondents who characterized both Trump and Harris as fascists. Only 32 percent of the respondents thought that neither candidate is a fascist. Is America really in danger of turning fascist? The survey defined 'fascist' rather broadly as 'a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents.' This definition is misleading (perhaps intentionally so), since most Americans view communism as being an alternative form of political extremism and would hesitate to apply the fascist label to any communist. If the question had been reworded to ask whether or not a given candidate was 'fascist or communist,' many more respondents would likely have moved Harris into the extremist category. Another difficulty is that the words like 'fascist' and 'Nazi' have been routinely used as fear-evoking smears for a very long time. One of the keenest critics of the political abuses of language, George Orwell, despairingly called attention to the ambiguity of the word 'fascism' in its ordinary usage in his 1944 newspaper article 'What is Fascism?': It will be seen that, as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley’s broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else. Yet underneath all this mess there does lie a kind of buried meaning. To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy to point out and not easy to explain away, between the régimes called Fascist and those called democratic. Secondly, if 'Fascist' means 'in sympathy with Hitler', some of the accusations I have listed above are obviously very much more justified than others. Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word 'Fascist' in every direction attach at any rate an emotional significance to it. By 'Fascism' they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class. Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathizers, almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come. But Fascism is also a political and economic system. Why, then, cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one—not yet, anyway. To say why would take too long, but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves, nor the Conservatives, nor Socialists of any colour, are willing to make. All one can do for the moment is to use the word with a certain amount of circumspection and not, as is usually done, degrade it to the level of a swearword. There is little doubt that the word 'fascism' has been used in an equally-ambiguous manner lately, with President Biden explicitly using the word against Trump and partisan legacy media outlets supporting Biden’s accusation with witnesses claiming Trump wanted to coerce political opponents on various occasions by using military, police, or angry mobs and of resorting to viciously-racist rhetoric and policies, particularly regarding illegal immigrants. Conservative commentators, in turn, accused Democrats and Democrat-friendly elites and bureaucrats of instituting censorship of social media, of instigating frivolous prosecutions and litigation directed against Trump and his supporters, of funding violent street protesters, of engaging in fraudulent vote counts, and of concocting numerous fabrications and misrepresentations against Trump with the assistance of numerous members of the intelligence community. Suspicions were also aroused by at least two assassination attempts against Trump by individuals having unknown motives and affiliations. To assess if American political trends bear more than just a superficial resemblance to the original Italian model, it is important to take up Orwell’s 1944 challenge and provide a clear definition of what qualifies as fascism, and to better understand how democracies are transformed into fascist states. The original Italian promoters of Fascism, dictator Benito Mussolini, and idealist philosopher Giovanni Gentile, were prolific writers who authored numerous works attempting to explain and justify fascism, including Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals(1925), Origins and Doctrine of Fascism (1929), and The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism (1932). However, it is not easy to formulate a clear definition of fascism from their works, in part because they rejected all-encompassing ideological explanations for what they viewed as spontaneous political developments driven by the practical political needs of the moment. What does emerge as a positive doctrine in their works is an elevation of the state to the status of an Absolute (not unlike G.W.F. Hegel’s deification of the Prussian state)—an organic entity that supposedly gives spiritual meaning to life and actively creates nationhood, and where mere individuals (contra classical liberalism) or economic classes (contra Marxism) count for nothing except to the extent they are harmoniously integrated together as parts of the nation-state whole. Another clearcut fascist doctrine is that the interests of different states are irreconcilable and, therefore, a state must go to war with other states in order to prosper. Again, in 1944, three classical liberals cut through the conceptual fog that bedeviled Orwell, writing books warning about the dangers of fascism—American journalist John Flynn (As We Go Marching) and Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises (Omnipotent Government) and Friedrich von Hayek (The Road to Serfdom). Flynn and Hayek offered troubling political, economic, and ideological comparisons between the two leading fascist nations and western nations (America and Britain respectively), warning that the prevailing ideas and policies of the New Deal in America and of Labour partisans in Britain were leading those countries down the same road that Italy and Germany had followed. Mises and Hayek analyzed the ideological origins of fascist regimes and the causes of their political success, with a particular focus on the rise of Nazism in Germany. Flynn listed eight defining characteristics of a fascist social system: (1) Governmental powers are unrestrained (totalitarianism); (2) Governmental powers are concentrated in the hands of a dictator supported by a political elite (the leadership principle); (3) Production and distribution are in private hands, but directed by state planners ('public-private partnerships' or corporatism); (4) State regimentation of production is effected through regulations promulgated by immense bureaucracies; (5) Investments are also regimented through an integration of government and private finances ('industrial policy' and 'monetary policy'); (6) Consumption is also subjected to government planning on a large scale via the deficit-financing of government spending (e.g., welfarism, public works) and the creation of purchasing power (inflation); (7) Militarism is also embraced as an element of planned consumption; (8) Imperialism also follows as a consequence from militarism and other elements of fascism Flynn aligned with the original Italian fascists in associating fascism with totalitarianism, corporatism, and military conquest, but he notably cited neither nationalism nor racism in his definition. While many protest Flynn’s omission, Mussolini and Gentile tended towards the view that states made nations and peoples, not the other way around. Unlike many Nazis, they were not reflexive chauvinists or eugenicists. For them, the state, not the nation as such, always comes first. To be sure, demagogic appeals to nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, etc. can explain why totalitarians gain public support in specific instances. Mises and Hayek offered critical qualifications about this though. In their view, interventionism, welfarism, and inflationism are what ultimately destabilized economies, democratic institutions, and international peace in spite of sincere democratic intentions of most of those who instituted such policies. While it may be an obnoxious nationalist demagogue who delivers the final coup de grace to a democracy, one could never succeed in seizing power without the institutions and ideology of economic collectivism already being in place. The illiberal policies that caused the First World War and the Great Depression and the economic chaos following from those events were necessary antecedents to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. In the penultimate chapter of his book, Hayek also presciently warned that multinational institutions would fail to keep peace among nations if central planning to continued to exist, either by states at a national level or by supranational authorities at a global level—a severe rebuke to the 'anti-fascist' pretensions of contemporary Davos elites. America is indeed in serious danger of turning fascist; not specifically because Donald Trump won the election, but because partisans on both sides, together with globalist elites and Deep State operatives, have built a system with most of Flynn’s fascist elements already in place, lacking only a willful executive empowered by an enabling act.

Wealth Redistribution Is A Hidden Property Right Infringement – O...	In The Theory of Political Spectrum, I presented three critical factors that influence the polarization of political ideologies: attitudes toward private property rights, the state of consciousness, and the degree of wealth redistribution. The article demonstrates that an assault on private property, the collectivization of consciousness, or widespread and involuntary wealth redistribution—either individually or collectively—are methods of making society more oriented to socialism. The last factor, wealth redistribution, has a close relationship with private property rights but is often ignored by mainstream academics and policy analysts. They have become so accustomed to extensive social programs and progressive taxation as normal conditions of a modern state that they fail to recognize the underlying economic and moral flaws. Neglecting this factor overlooks the central role it played in the gradual adoption of evolutionary socialism in the United States. The Significance of Wealth Redistribution For decades, the U.S. fought against the global expansion of communism, positioning itself as the defender of capitalist ideals and individual freedoms. Yet, during this global struggle, evolutionary socialism quietly took root at home. Unlike revolutionary socialism, which seeks to overthrow the existing order through radical means, evolutionary socialism advances gradually, using legal and institutional mechanisms. One of the most effective tools in this process is wealth redistribution. Through taxation and social programs, evolutionary socialism embedded itself in American society without attracting much attention. The U.S. was vigilant against external threats but failed to recognize how wealth redistribution was being used as a subtle tactic to undermine private property rights and promote socialist ideals within the country. Wealth redistribution shifted resources from private individuals to the state, creating the foundation for a more collectivist approach to economic and social governance. Therefore, wealth redistribution is an extremely important factor. It is not just a policy of economic adjustment, but a tool that gradually shifts the power dynamics in society, eroding individual property rights and enabling the expansion of state control. Ignoring this factor allows evolutionary socialism to grow in the background, weakening the foundations of private enterprise and individual freedom. The Origin of Evolutionary Socialism Evolutionary socialism advocates for gradual and legal reforms to bring about socialist changes within a capitalist society. Its roots trace back to key figures and movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most notably Eduard Bernstein and the Fabian Society in Britain. Eduard Bernstein, a German Marxist and political theorist, argued that socialism was attainable through gradual, democratic reforms instead of violent revolution. His ideas, expressed in Evolutionary Socialism (1899), emphasized the potential for adaptation and evolution within capitalism. Therefore, socialism could be integrated into existing political systems through reforms like extending suffrage, labor rights, and social welfare. Bernstein’s ideas laid the foundation for what would later be known as democratic socialism or social democracy. At the same time, the Fabian Society in Britain pursued a similar approach. Members of the Fabian Society and Bernstein likely influenced each other. Founded in 1884, the Fabian Society sought to implement socialism progressively through education, political activism, and legislative reforms. Rejecting revolution, the Fabians believed in working within existing institutions to transform society deliberately. Their emblem, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, symbolized their strategy of subtle infiltration. They used established systems to introduce socialist reforms without direct confrontation. The Fabian Society had a strong influence on British politics, particularly in shaping the Labour Party’s platform, and had a significant, albeit less pronounced, impact on progressive thought in the United States. Today, the Democratic Party has openly endorsed the principles of evolutionary socialism. It would be more accurate to call them the Social-Democratic Party, as many of their European counterparts have done. Unfortunately, the Republican Party has not only failed to counteract the collectivist reforms pushed by the Democrats over the years, but it has also started embracing left-leaning ideas. This drift has taken the party further from the rightist position of economic and individual freedom. Both parties now view the state as a major economic player and rely more on government solutions than on market forces. Progressive Taxation and Property Rights What follows is a simplified numerical exploration of how progressive taxation, a central mechanism of wealth redistribution, constantly infringes upon private property rights, leading to the slow erosion of financial returns on privately owned property. Consider the example of a private enterprise that owns 10 units of equipment, each costing $1,000. These units of equipment are used to produce commodities that generate a total profit of $100,000 after all expenses. Under a 10% tax rate, the business would pay $10,000 in taxes, leaving a net profit of $90,000. Each of the 10 units of equipment contributes equally to the total profit, meaning each unit accounts for $9,000 of the net profit. Now, suppose the government implements a progressive tax structure that increases the rate to 20% for profits at or above $100,000. Under this new system, the business would be taxed $20,000, leaving a net profit of only $80,000. In this scenario, ceteris paribus, each unit of equipment now contributes only $8,000 to the net profit. The progressive tax effectively reduces the profit generated by each unit by $1,000. Prior to the tax increase, it was possible to attain the same $80,000 net profit by utilizing only 9 units of equipment (since $80,000 / $9,000 = ~9 units), with each unit contributing $9,000 under the original 10% tax rate. The additional tax renders one unit of the businessman’s equipment economically redundant. Even though the proprietor still possesses and maintains all 10 units, the government has silently confiscated the value created by one of them through elevated taxation. This gradual and hidden assault on private property means that while the businessman maintains his equipment, the income it generates is partially appropriated by the state. Progressive taxation undermines the fundamental principle of private property by eroding the financial returns that property is meant to produce. Faced with this situation, the businessman may resort to certain measures to protect his property and profit. Rather than allowing the government to seize a portion of the value produced by his equipment, he may choose to sell one unit outright, reducing his total production capacity. For instance, if the businessman sells one unit of equipment for $1,000, leaving him with 9 units, he can limit his production to keep total profits below $100,000. This keeps him in the 10% tax bracket, maintaining a higher after-tax profit. This strategy demonstrates how progressive taxation incentivizes business owners to limit their productive capacity in order to protect their property. This scenario illustrates how progressive taxation undermines private property rights, not through direct confiscation, but by diminishing the value that property can generate. Over time, this creates a gradual erosion of the businessman’s wealth and economic power. As each tax increase forces him to either accept reduced profits or downsize his operations to avoid further losses, the result is a steady transfer of wealth and productive capacity from private individuals to the state, undermining the very foundation of private enterprise and property ownership. The Immorality of Wealth Redistribution Of course, contemporary humane society does not want its members to experience hardship or lead a miserable existence. There are indeed categories of people, such as the disabled or elderly, who genuinely need assistance. Ideally, such help would come from voluntary donations by individuals and private organizations, which would not only provide for those in need but also demonstrate the true compassion and generosity of a society. Voluntary charity reflects a community’s collective empathy and moral values, showing that people are willing to uplift others without coercion or the force of law.While some level of state involvement in providing a safety net is not entirely rejected, it should remain limited and targeted. Government intervention in assisting the most vulnerable can play a role, especially in areas where private charity may fall short. However, mandatory wealth redistribution through extensive taxation is both economically and morally flawed. When the primary goal of such redistribution is to eliminate so-called inequality, it punishes success and discourages initiative. Those who work hard, take risks, and create value are penalized, while an underclass is created for whom 'poverty' becomes a profitable lifestyle. This system disincentivizes personal responsibility and ambition, rewarding reliance on state benefits rather than encouraging self-sufficiency and economic mobility.Moreover, when wealth redistribution is framed as a solution to economic inequality, it perpetuates a narrative of entitlement and resentment. The focus shifts from creating opportunities for growth and innovation to redistributing the achievements of others. Rather than fostering a society where people are motivated to strive for success, such policies breed stagnation, where personal effort is devalued, and the rewards of hard work are forcibly taken to subsidize those who may lack the same drive. In the long run, this undermines the moral fabric of a free and productive society, fostering a culture where dependence on government aid becomes normalized, and individual liberty is eroded.

The EU’s Dual Approach: Green Subsidies And Tariffs On China EVs ...	On October 29, 2024, the European Commission unveiled new countervailing duties on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports, effective the following day. This move is framed as part of a broader aggressive strategy to safeguard European industries, but it overlooks a significant reality. The EU itself has long been an active player in subsidizing its own green transition, including the EV sector. Recent EU statistics reveal that Brussels and its member states have poured substantial financial support into the 'new trio' industries—lithium batteries, photovoltaic products, and electric vehicles—through a mix of grants, tax breaks, low-interest loans, loan guarantees, and price subsidies. These subsidies, which are often justified by the need to boost competitiveness and drive regional development, have granted the EU a commanding role in emerging industries. Although the EU has rules to limit state funding, it has allowed member states to provide targeted financial support. On top of this, the EU itself has established dedicated funds for direct grants. In 2022 alone, the EU allocated a staggering 25 billion euros to solar power through its various financial mechanisms. This extensive dual-channel support, blending EU funds with member-state aid, has given European green industries a major competitive edge, which stands in sharp contrast to the tariffs now imposed on China’s own green transition. The European Union, under the pretext of advancing the green transition and aiding underdeveloped regions, has created an extensive network of at least 11 subsidy funds targeting emerging industries like lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and electric vehicles. These funds, including the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), Horizon Europe, and the Just Transition Fund, among others, form a robust financial infrastructure designed to fuel the EU’s competitive edge. With the EU’s strategic investment in these sectors, the bloc aims to dominate critical green technologies even as China’s similar efforts are increasingly met with tariffs and restrictions. As of April 2024, the RRF has allocated 87.9 billion euros to sustainable transportation projects, particularly in zero- and low-emission vehicles, reinforcing the EU’s green agenda. Horizon Europe, with a total budget of 93.5 billion euros for the 2021-2027 period, has already dispersed 22.7 million euros to bolster research and innovation. Meanwhile, the Innovation Fund, fueled by EU carbon emissions trading revenue, is expected to grant at least 40 billion euros by 2030 to advance low-carbon technologies. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), with a defined objective of narrowing the development gap between regions, has allocated 104.3 billion euros from 2021 to 2027. This sum will support green initiatives like energy transitions and sustainable urban mobility, furthering the EU’s low-emission agenda. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) also plays a crucial role, investing in interconnected, high-performance trans-European networks. From 2021 to 2022 alone, the CEF awarded 1.66 billion euros to 18 energy projects, spanning electricity, carbon dioxide, and renewable energy. The European Union’s focus on electric vehicles has elevated the battery industry as a key player, with EU funds pouring substantial support into this sector. Among the 'new trio' industries, battery projects have garnered the largest subsidies, often covering over half of their total costs. Horizon Europe, for instance, allocated 873 million euros to 307 battery R&D initiatives between 2014 and 2020. The Innovation Fund provided 161 million euros to eight battery projects from 2021 to 2022. Meanwhile, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) channeled 319 million euros into 459 battery-related initiatives across 14 member states. By 2023, the European Union had also firmly committed to the electrification of its transport sector, with all 27 member states enacting at least one electric vehicle (EV) consumption subsidy policy. These efforts have largely been driven by tax incentives and direct grants, offering substantial financial support for EV adoption. Among the frontrunners, Germany stands out, having allocated a remarkable 10 billion euros in subsidies to foster electric vehicle adoption. It has also extended motor vehicle tax exemptions for electric vehicles multiple times since 2012, including a 10-year circulation tax exemption for EVs, which began in 2016. Also that year, Germany introduced the 'Government Programme for Electric Mobility' by committing 1.2 billion euros for environmental bonuses for electric and plug-in hybrid cars, alongside 300 million euros to expand charging infrastructure. France, meanwhile, offers a 50 percent reduction on registration fees and a full exemption on license plate registration for both fully electric and hybrid vehicles. Spain, in 2023, introduced a 15 percent personal income tax reduction for electric vehicle purchases and charging infrastructure, with deductions reaching up to 20,000 euros for EVs and 4,000 euros for chargers. Grants, too, play a crucial role in the push for EV consumption across the EU. France’s 8 billion euro 'Automotive Industry Revitalization Plan,' launched in 2020, includes direct subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles, alongside trade-in bonuses for consumers who replace older fossil-fuel cars with greener alternatives. Locally, 131 cities in the Paris metropolitan area have offered varying degrees of aid to EV buyers. As the European Union escalates its efforts to counter Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports with new tariffs, subsidies often account for over half of the budget for many green initiatives. These subsidy programs—aimed at bolstering its green industries—have already reshaped the market, giving European companies an undeniable edge. Rather than hastily imposing punitive tariffs on China, the EU should instead foster a global, cooperative effort to advance green technologies, ensuring a fair, competitive, and sustainable EV market for all.

Trump’s Multiethnic Winning Coalition – OpEd	Go on, admit it. Don’t be shy. Did you feel the joy in the late evening and early hours of 5–6 November? How about the vibe? Democrats failed to feel either as the garbage deplorables took out the trash and made a bonfire of the dumpster bin. The diversity hire can now retire and feel the sadness of adversity instead. Donald Trump’s 312-226 landslide victory in the Electoral College is not a repudiation of democracy but a triumphant affirmation of its liberating power. He lost the popular vote in 2016 by three million votes (two percent) and in 2020 by 7 million (four percent). This time he won the popular vote by three million (76-73) and two percent (50.1-48.1) – his first victory in the number of ballots and in securing an absolute majority. About 90 percent of over 3,000 counties across the nation shifted to the right. Trump won in 2016 with a winning coalition of disaffected working-class whites. More than half of workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, the purchasing power of which has been falling with high inflation. Contrary to the American dream of intergenerational progress, many young people have a worse standard of living than their parents. While consolidating that voting base, the more sweeping triumph this year was helped considerably by substantial inroads into ethnic groups traditionally aligned with Democrats. Trump described his diverse and inclusive coalition as a ‘beautiful,’ ‘historical realignment’ in his victory speech on the night. Harris refused to give a concession speech until the day after. In an NBC exit poll, Trump won 57 percent of white and 55 percent of male voters, retaining his hold on these groups. In an AP exit poll, he won 20 percent of the black vote, up from 8 in 2016 and 13 in 2020. Harris’s 80 percent black vote is a ten-point drop from Joe Biden’s four years ago. In addition, he also won the support of 46 percent of Latinos, 39 percent of Asian-Americans, 54 percent of ‘Other,’ 45 percent of women, and 43 percent of 18–29-year-olds. Hence the prospect of a major new realignment of American politics. There are important lessons in all this for centre-right parties across the West: authentic conservatism attracts more voters than it repels. Trump’s success in creating a new multiethnic winning coalition indicates that voting trends may be coalescing, with previously segmented cohorts normalising and starting to vote more as Americans and less as ethnics. Thus in an AP analysis, the economy and jobs rated as the top issues for voters overall, for blacks and Latinos, and for the youth. Phrases like the Latino, black, or Asian-American vote are increasingly meaningless. What once were voting blocs are fragmenting into individuals with agency. This can only be good for the long-term health of American democracy, contrary to the hysterical warnings of its imminent collapse should Trump win. In the history books, 2016 might be described as a dress rehearsal for the real deal in 2024. Trump won back the White House and delivered Congress on his coattails, with a net gain of four Senate and 1-2 House seats. Plus he will have a favourable balance of justices on the Supreme Court. All this will be crucial in confronting the expected challenges from Resistance 2.0, aka swamp dwellers protesting at the swamp drainage scheme. So will the lessons internalised from the experience of 2016–20, including the choice of top personnel who understand and are committed to the Trump agenda. Traditional Voter Concerns Beat Woke Neoliberalism Progressives once again went into meltdown. Writing in The Globe and Mail in reliably woke Canada, Andrew Coyne solemnly describes Trump as ‘manifestly, palpably, incontrovertibly unfit for public office, not only in his own character and abilities, but for what he represents, including his attacks on the rule of law, basic freedoms and democracy itself.’ His take on the outcome? ‘Sometimes the people get it wrong.’ He echoed the instant reaction from Jill Filipovic that ‘this election was not an indictment’ of Harris but ‘an indictment of America.’ At least one Guardiancolumnist gets it. John Harris concluded that the ‘simple, inescapable message’ from Trump’s victory is that ‘many people despise the left’ with progressives seen as ‘one judgmental, 'woke' mass.’ Harris goes on to note that support for border security and enforcement was higher among blacks and Hispanics than among white progressives. So too for statements that ‘America is the greatest country in the world’ where ‘most people can make it if they work hard,’ again contradicting the core tenets of critical race theory. The fact that Trump’s 14-point advantage among voters without college degrees flips into a 13-point loss among the college-educated indicates the source of the luxury beliefs. This in a tough economic environment in which, in a survey last year, 39 percent of Americans admitted to having skipped meals to keep up with housing payments. Trump was authentic and Harris inauthentic, intellectually shallow, morally vacuous, and prone to mistaking platitudes as policy pronouncements. Harris held a celebrity-studded rally in Philadelphia on 4 November. Speaking at his own overlapping rally in Pittsburgh, Trump said: ‘We don’t need a star because we have policy.’ She recruited Republican reject Liz Cheney whose surname remains toxic among true-blue Democrats. He won over disillusioned Democrats Robert F Kennedy, Jr (nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services) and Tulsi Gabbard (the new Director of National Intelligence) along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (co-chairs of a new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE). Her only sales pitch was ‘I am not Trump. I am not Biden.’ This was delivered with an accompaniment of trademark word salads, infamous cackles, and a baffling array of accents to suit every audience. Trump dodged bullets, Harris dodged questions. He had a record to defend, she had one to airbrush. Democrats voted for the party, not Harris. MAGA people voted for Trump more than the party. Harris neither explained and defended the last four years nor articulated a vision for the next four. All she did was to attack Trump. He closed with the simple yet powerful question: Are you better off now than then? They replied: Diversity hire, you are fired. Trump won, Harris lost, and the progressive governance elite was humiliated. The biggest losers of the night were A-list celebrities and the legacy media. Even Taylor Swift’s hometown of Reading, PA went with Trump. She might be a fashion influencer but is no more an opinion influencer and thought leader than I am a fashion influencer. The centre ground of the political information complex has shifted from legacy to online alternative and podcast media. As Kimberly Strassel put it in the Wall Street Journal, it was ‘a landslide against the media’ (think CBS editing a word salad answer from Harris into a crisper sound bite but refusing to publish the full transcript). Echoing the ‘quadfecta’ of the GOP capture of the Presidency, Senate, House, and popular vote, the MSM too suffered a quadruple calamity. Their preferred candidate lost. Their already dented credibility was torn to shreds. Echoing the George Costanza strategy, some voters did the opposite of what the media hacks told them, echoing last year’s Voice referendum here in Australia. Also like the Voice, Harris’s massive spending advantage merely reinforced the perception that she was the candidate of the wealthy few and he of the more numerous little guys. Ironically, the media helped shrink-wrap the Democrats in the DC bubble so they never woke up to just how cut off they’d become from the concerns, fears, hopes, and aspirations of everyday Americans. Reduced to a party of, by, and for elites, they mistook the noise of shouty inner-city activists for the voice of Middle America. The voters gave the tiresome snobs (elites) and scolds (culture warriors) a big ‘FU’ in return, just like with the Voice down under. Growing the Trump Voter Base There isn’t just one US presidential election but 50 simultaneous but separate ones in every state, each with its own rules and processes. Similarly, there isn’t one unified and cohesive electorate but several distinct voting cohorts. As alluded to above, the Trump-led Republicans deepened their appeal among white working-class Americans but also broadened it to peel away once-solid support for the Democrats among specific cohorts and bring them inside the Republican tent. This was particularly true of but not limited to the immigrant ethnic groups. According to a Forbes analysis, Harris’s six-point lead over Trump among Latinos was a steep drop from the 33 and 38-point margins for Biden and Clinton in 2020/2016. In Starr County in south Texas with a 97 percent Latino population that hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1892 and Clinton won by 79 points in 2016, Trump won 58 percent of the votes this time round. In Queens County, NY, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse counties in the US, the needle moved 20 points towards Trump from 2020. For all the brouhaha over an insult comedian’s off-colour Puerto Rican joke, even heavily Puerto Rican Osceola, FL, which Biden carried by nearly 14 points, flipped to Trump. Clearly, voters were not moved much by Harris’s appeal to gender and minorities. Having failed to read the room, CNN’s exit poll shows that the Democrats have shrunk into the party of college-educated, high-income (above $100,000), whites, and single women. None of the four main attack lines against Trump – a convicted felon, a racist, a misogynist, a wannabe Hitler who will destroy American democracy – resonated with these demographics. The first was viewed as the result of anti-democratic lawfare. The second was contradicted by the evidence of their own lying eyes with people such as Nikki Haley, Ramaswamy, Gabbard (raised a Hindu), Kash Patel, and Bobby Jindal inside the GOP fold. Ditto the third with Haley, Gabbard, Susie Wiles (Trump’s new chief of staff, plus Elise Stefanik and Kristi Noem among his other early top picks), his public support for Kellyanne Conway, and his emphatic support for women’s rights against trans extremism. The fourth flew in the face of their direct experience of the records of Trump and Biden-Harris and their own judgment on which of the respective two records was the greater violation of democratic norms. The CNN exit poll confirmed that voters perceived democracy to be threatened almost evenly by Harris and Trump. The established immigrant populations too see economic downsides to having newer immigrant workers come in and compete for jobs. They too object to unlimited immigration on cultural grounds, having become proud of their American citizenship. They may even become more vociferous defenders of Americanism than whites who can trace their ancestry in the US further back but are wracked with guilt over historical sins like slavery and racism. They fault the Democrats on immigration, culture wars, and pronouns, and net zero obsession and costs be damned. Their optimistic vision for America is one based on promoting nationhood, national identity, American culture, secure borders, a history of many accomplishments to be proud of and celebrated, social conservatism, the prosperity of people who actually live in the country, and a better life for their kids. Democracy Under Threat In a surreal bait-and-switch tactic, the Democrats campaigned heavily on the fear that Trump, a closet Hitler, would begin to establish a dictatorship from Day One. This is from the party that overturned the democratic choice of 14 million voters to dump Biden and impose a DEI pick for the ultimate job, even though she failed to win a single delegate in 2020 and did not contest the party primary this year. She knew it, Americans knew it, the world knew it. Everyone also knew that the Democrats had lied about Biden’s cognitive health for four years and then, after replacing him, lied about Harris’s fitness for office. They treated voters with open contempt and they’ve returned the favour. When the machine came after Trump in a scorched earth campaign of total lawfare, blacks and immigrants from countries where state harassment is routine related to him. This is disturbingly reminiscent to many immigrants, including Indians, of the VIP culture in their home countries which they fled in search of a better future for themselves and their descendants in the land of opportunity and the free. The Democrats mostly refused to accept the legitimacy of Trump’s victory in 2016 and worked assiduously to undermine his presidency with guerrilla tactics and the Russia collusion hoax. Fifty-one former senior intelligence officials ran election interference against Trump in 2020 with knowingly false declarations on the Hunter Biden laptop story as classic Russian disinformation. They spied on his campaign, impeached him twice, arrested him, and tried to bankrupt, incarcerate, and throw him off the ballot. He was twice the target of assassination attempts and famously rose up from one with defiant fist pumps of ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’ He absorbed all the punches and just kept coming back at them. This was the mother of all overkills. Those pushing it sounded more like demented rage addicts than serious contenders for high political office. In the end, the only verdict that matters was delivered by the jury of all American voters. The charge that Trump is an existential threat to American democracy was also totally contradicted by Harris’s concession speech on the 6th: We lost this battle, she said, but the fight goes on and we will win the next time. And then she appealed for kindness towards the person she had been trashing for the past 100 days as a racist and sexist second coming of Hitler. Immigration Immigration has long been argued to bring multiple benefits of economic stimulus and growth, replenished gene pool, enriched cultural diversity, exposure to the world’s diverse range of scrumptious cuisine, and so on. In the US, Republicans tolerated illegal immigrants as a large pool of cheap labour and Democrats as a large bloc of reliable long-term votes. But in recent times mass and illegal immigration in particular have tipped the balance away from net benefits to harms, including net lifetime drain on public finances and stressed out public infrastructure. This is more so for the working classes than the elites. This has put many settled liberal assumptions under scrutiny. For example, it is true that liberalism embraces multiculturalism. But actual and growing evidence in many Western democracies clearly indicates that not all multicultural groups embrace the core assumptions and values of liberalism, including tolerance for diversity of faiths, beliefs, and practices. The resulting fractures of civic culture, social cohesion, and political stability have heavily qualified the experience of shared citizenship. By reversing Trump’s efforts to control the southern border and opening it wide to floods of illegal aliens on Harris’ watch as the border czar, the Democrats left her candidacy hostage to fortune and have paid the price. Exit polls showed immigration and the economy as the voters’ top two concerns and Trump – with a tough message on immigration, border enforcement, and mass deportations – won on these with 90 and 80 percent support. A Win for Women’s Rights against Trans Colonisation of Female Spaces The progressive cultural crusade is quintessentially Western, irrelevant, and repugnant to many non-Westerners. They don’t subscribe to white privilege and guilt, don’t believe masculinity is toxic and all women should be believed automatically when making serious allegations of sexual assault that devastate not just the man but his whole family, don’t support affirmative action for blacks, women, and transgender, don’t obsess over personal pronouns, and don’t lie in bed terrified of being cooked alive by global boiling. They were horrified at the very thought, in the name of promoting trans rights, of males invading female spaces involving their daughters, from sporting competitions to changing rooms, showers, toilets, and schoolchildren on overnight camping trips. Trump’s disdain for these progressive pieties quite appeals to them. The distortion of policy priorities by the Democrats on climate catastrophism and trans extremism moved the needle of voter sentiment from opposed to angry. Most migrant minorities would favour a return to the progressive centrism of equal opportunity and fairness, not the cultural Marxist nostrum of identity-driven equitable outcomes. While Trump-Vance spoke to people’s concerns on inflation, jobs, energy security, mass illegal immigration, and crime, Harris-Walz identified with boutique ideas around race and gender. Trump’s counterattack on transgender rights more than offset abortion – sorry, reproductive rights – as an issue for women in general and for non-white men and women in particular. In a Gallup Poll last year, 69 percent of Americans backed restricting sporting teams to biological sex and not based on gender self-identity. Harris suffered a fall of three points from men and two points from women voters; Trump gained three points from both. How could this be: Isn’t he misogyny incarnate? The Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the most grievous assault on the sacrosanct principles of bodily integrity and ‘My Body, My Choice’ with its vaccine mandates. But when the Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade in June 2022, they suddenly rediscovered their passion for the same principles and launched an all-out attack on the threat to abortion from another Trump term. Yet, in a report published in May 2024 by Guttmacher Institute, a research organisation that supports access to abortion, the total number of abortions in the US was 1,037,000 in 2023, the first full year after the court decision. According to CDC data, this was a 64 percent jump from 625,978 in 2021 before the court decision (possibly depressed during shutdowns) and the highest in a decade. Most people want neither harshly restrictive access to abortions nor the removal of all restrictions until birth. But most people don’t feel comfortable discussing it, believing it to be an intensely personal choice. The topic doesn’t align with the joy vibe and there’s something unsettling about any national leader who campaigns against bringing children into the world. About a third of American women are pro-life. Even among pro-choice women, the majority don’t back abortion all the way to full term. Trump sided with the Supreme Court that it’s a state-level political issue, not one for the federal judiciary to adjudicate. He explicitly ruled out taking any further action and promised to veto any national ban on abortion. In the end, the much-trumpeted gender gap worked to Trump’s net advantage. Men broke for him 55-42 and women for Harris 53-45, giving Trump a five-point net gain. The issue didn’t even excite the young. About 39 percent of young women and 42 percent of young men identified jobs and the economy as their top issue, while 17 percent and 8 percent picked abortion. Trump won 40 percent of the votes of female under-30s, up by seven points. Harris won the under-30s overall by 52-46, but fell back from Biden’s margin by 19 points. He won among under-30 men by 14 percent, a 29-point swing from 2020. The Democrats spent $175 million on TV ads across the country to hammer their message on abortion – more than on any other issue. Republicans spent $123 millionattacking trans athletes. One ad featured footage of Harris from the 2019 primaries saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for illegal immigrants and transgender prison inmates. The tagline: ‘Kamala’s For They/Them. President Trump is for you’ was exceptionally effective. The New York Timesreported on 7 November on an analysis by Future Forward, a pro-Harris super PAC, that that one single ad shifted the race by a stunning 2.7 percent towards Trump after viewers watched it. Culture warriors have captured and occupied the commanding heights of state and public institutions, including most of the print and electronic legacy media, from which to coerce and harass critics and dissenters into compliance through an expansive abuse of administrative power by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner is a good example and I wonder how much harm this American import has caused to Australia’s critical relationship with the incoming administration by picking a fight with Musk (which she lost) who will wield a powerful influence on Trump. Indo-Americans For reasons that should be self-evident, I am more familiar with Indo-American than with other groups’ sentiments. The comments that follow draw on many conversations over time with colleagues, friends, and relations in the US. Unlike the low depression hanging over many Western capitals led by people yet to outgrow student politics, in heavily polluted Delhi the Modi government will be pleased to see the House of Orange restored to the White House. Speaking at a function in Mumbai on 10 November, in response to a question from the audience on the implications of Trump 2.0 for India, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar remarked(at around 25 minutes) that ‘a lot of countries are nervous about the US…We are not one of them.’ He said that Modi’s call of congratulations was among the first three that Trump took from foreign leaders. The rise in India’s global profile has coincided with the rise into public prominence of many people of Indian origin living in the West, none more so than in the US. There are 5.2 million Indo-Americans, over half of them of voting age. They have been a historically solid Democratic voting cohort. Their high-income worth, educational qualifications, professional occupations, and political engagement give them a role that belies their small numbers. It’s worth remembering that small numbers can tip the outcomes in just a handful of states to determine the overall winner. There are over 700,000 Indians in the seven swing states. In 2016, 84 percent of Indo-Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, falling to 68 percent for Biden in 2020. Harris’s share fell again to 60 percent, despite her mother being Indian. Support for Trump was 31 percent, up from 22 percent in 2020. Many Indo-Americans had to wait years for a green card while working in tech, starting companies, paying taxes, but unable to claim Social Security benefits until they became citizens. Immigration as a fairness issue has turned many into Trump voters, especially when they see undocumented immigrants committing crimes and accessing social benefits funded in part by their taxes. They resent Democrats pandering to grifters who contribute little to society or the economy and forgiving debts incurred by students of the many victimhood and grievance degrees. Coming from a country that was invaded, conquered, colonised, and ruled for a thousand years by Islamic and British invaders then partitioned, they are bewildered at being maligned as White Adjacent for their success through education and work ethic because this contradicts the narrative of oppressed minorities. They fought all the way to the Supreme Court against discriminatory admissions by the nation’s elite universities. They have lived experience of the onerous burden of the parasitical regulatory state. The reasons why Indo-Americans have begun switching to Trump’s Republican Party offer important clues on Trump’s appeal to other Asian-Americans, Latinos, and blacks. This should attract the interest of campaign strategists of centre-right parties across Western democracies, including Australia, on how to fight and win culture wars and defend cultural centrism in order to win elections in a rapidly evolving political landscape where traditional partisanship is in freefall and new alignments are coalescing around class- and family-based values and concerns.

US Congressional Leadership Remains United In Devotion To Israel ...	Some things changed in politics in Washington, DC when on Wednesday Republican United States senators via a secret ballot vote selected Sen John Thune (R-SD) to become Senate Republican leader, replacing Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in the position. One of the things that remained the same, though, was that the Senate Republican leader position, along with the other three top leadership positions — Republican and Democrat — in the Senate and House of Representatives, remains held by a politician espousing devotion to the government of Israel and its war effort. In July of 2022, I wrote about the peculiar situation where these top congressional leaders were then as well lined up in adamant support for the Israel government despite the fact that Americans’ views regarding the Middle East nation were roughly evenly divided between favorable and negative views. Of the people then holding the four top Republican and Democratic leadership positions in Congress, only Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) remains in the group. Nonetheless, the unanimity in over-the-top support for Israel persists, irrespective of how out of step it is with the thinking of the American people, even as over the last year Americans have increasingly opposed the US government’s unwavering supplying of military and intelligence support for Israel waging its expanding war with catastrophic consequences. In January of 2023, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), a die-hard supporterof the Israel government, became the top Democratic leader in the House. Then, when Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was ousted from the House speaker position in the fall of 2023, something astounding happened: All 11 candidates to succeed him as speaker — including ultimate winner Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) — had expressed both their devotion to Israel and their devotion to the US supporting Israel in Israel’s war. Continuing the trend, all three Senate majority leader candidates — Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), and Sen. John Thune (R-SD) — competing last week were express devotees of the US government supporting Israel generally, as well as supporting Israel’s war effort. Cornyn made his devotion to Israel and its war crystal clear in an October 3 Dallas Morning News editorial titled 'America’s Next Commander in Chief Must Unapologetically Support Israel.' In the editorial, he declared: Support for Israel ought to transcend party lines, religion, race and ethnicity. This is not an issue of opinion; this is a battle of right and wrong, of good and evil. Israel is our most steadfast ally in the Middle East, and it deserves our full support, both in words and action.I was honored to visit Israel earlier this year, and I was also extremely proud to have voted for widely-supported legislation that sent critical aid and military resources to Israel. Scott in, of all places, his America First plank of his Rescue America plan put succinctly his dedication to supporting Israel. 'We will always defend our allies, starting with Israel,' Scott’s plan declares. Further, Scott made this promise in a September speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Summit: 'And, as Senate leader, you can count on support for Israel and protection for our Jewish communities being top priorities.' In the speech, Scott also declared: We need to show up for our friends and family in Israel right now. We need them to know we are with them, we will show up and we will fight with them. Thune, the winner of the Senate Republican leader race, is on the same page as his Senate Republican leader race opponents in regard to Israel. Thune wrote an editorial last month titled 'America Must Support Israeli Victory.' In the editorial, the senator criticized the Biden administration for not doing enough for Israel. This is the administration that has been pumping out weapons, intelligence, and military support to Israel at an incredible pace to aid Israel’s pursuit of its expanding war. After criticizing what he refers to as the Biden administration’s 'tepid support for Israel at a time when it needs a strong ally in the United States,' Thune declared the US 'needs to stand strongly with Israel as it faces enemies from every side that threaten its very existence.' And what did Thune do upon winning the leadership race? Thune called the prime minister of Israel, posting at Twitter for all to see a picture of Thune on the phone along with this message: 'Spoke with Prime Minister @netanyahu and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to standing with Israel, our closest friend and ally.' The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Monetary Policy: Donald Trump Versus Jerome Powell? – OpEd	President-elect Trump has, in the past, been at odds with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on monetary policy. Trump will likely favor lower interest rates and an easier monetary policy than Powell. However, Powell and the Fed act independently of the presidency, at least nominally, and when asked if he would step down if Trump asked him to, Powell said no. Powell has said he’s reluctant to lower interest rates until there’s good evidence that inflation is headed toward the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Such evidence will be difficult to come by in the next few months. It is unlikely that prices will continue their downward trend over the rest of the year. Recently released inflation data for October show that consumer prices rose by 2.6% over the past calendar year, which does not look that close to 2% to me. However, prices fell in November and December of 2023. Since the beginning of 2024, prices have risen by 2.9%. Any uptick in prices over the next two months will place the inflation rate for all of 2024 at or above 3%. Should that occur, it would appear from Powell’s comments that he would be reluctant to lower interest rates early in 2025 at the beginning of Trump’s term. That will put his agenda at odds with Trump’s. I expect some critical comments from Trump to be launched Powell’s way.

Why Putin Should Ignore Biden’s Pathetic ATACMS Provocation – OpE...	As provocations go, the latest by President Joe Biden to permit the use of long-range missile strikes on Russia is certainly audacious. But, ultimately, in practice, it is a pathetic gesture by a lame-duck president that will have no impact on Russia’s anticipated military victory against the NATO-armed Kiev regime. Biden’s reported decision is a desperate last-bid gamble to incite an escalation with Russia and to sabotage incoming plans by President-elect Trump to end the conflict in Ukraine. Biden’s move is reckless, reprehensible, and odious. But it should not be given any credibility as a serious threat. Russia would be best to ignore it. Of course, Russia has to defend itself against any increased potential threat to its territory that such weapons may pose. Nevertheless, Moscow should continue exercising the strategic restraint that President Putin is renowned for, and not retaliate over the provocation. Understandably, Russian politicians and media have reacted furiously to U.S. media reports that Biden gave the Ukrainian military the green light to deploy American-made ATACMS for striking deep into Russian territory. The ground-launched Mach-3 supersonic missiles have a range of up to 300 kilometers. The audacity and arrogance of the American ruling class knows no bounds. It has sanctioned Russia to the hilt (to no avail mind you), it has weaponized a NeoNazi regime in Kiev, it has killed civilians in the Russian territory of Crimea already with ATACMS, and so on. Now Biden is ramping up the assault capability deep into Russia. Two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that if the U.S. took such a move, then it would dramatically alter the very essence of the conflict in Ukraine, one where Moscow would see the United States and its NATO partners as 'direct participants' in a war against Russia. Putin’s reasoning was correct. The deployment of ATACMS and other sophisticated long-range missiles against Russia would inescapably mean that American and NATO personnel were manning these systems. The Ukrainian military – riven with desertion, in disarray, and suffering from poor morale – would not be capable of targeting and operating such munitions. The use of ATACMS, or air-launched JASSMs, and the British and French Storm Shadow and Scalp cruise missiles to hit Russia is tantamount to NATO’s direct involvement in a war against Russia. The implication of what Putin said was grave and potentially catastrophic. If the Western states took that step, the result could mean an all-out war between nuclear powers. When Putin issued his stark warning in September, Biden and other Western leaders, including Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, appeared at the time to heed it and back down from considerations to permit the Ukrainian regime to use long-range missiles against Russia. Now, however, Biden has flipped to finally give his approval, according to reports. The style of anonymous U.S. officials briefing the New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press has all the hallmarks of an orchestrated psychological operation. What has changed? Simple. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on November 5 with a resounding victory in defiance of the political establishment that wanted Kamala Harris to win. The Republican president-elect takes over in two months when he is inaugurated on January 20. Trump has repeatedly said he will negotiate an end to the nearly three-year conflict in Ukraine, which has seen the U.S. and NATO allies bankroll a corrupt regime in Ukraine to the tune of $200 billion. And yet after all that obscene wasting of Western public money to bloat the war machine, Russia is going to defeat the NATO proxy. The stakes for NATO’s future and the Western imperialist war machine could not be higher. The impressive electoral mandate for Trump suggests that the American public wants the U.S. warmongering to stop and for their mounting economic and social needs to be taken care of as a priority. Under Trump, the war racket could well be over. His nomination last week of Tulsi Gabbard – an outspoken critic of the NATO proxy war in Ukraine – as his Director of National Intelligence is a major sign of his bold intentions of negotiating a diplomatic settlement to the conflict. That means the end of the blood money flowing into the coffers of the Western military-industrial complex and Wall Street. Biden and the Democrat candidate Kamala Harris were the puppets of the war racket. To perform well, they mouthed endless Russophobia, making negotiations impossible with Moscow, and they swore to keep the conflict in Ukraine going 'for as long as it takes.' European leaders like Starmer, Macron, and Scholz are equally contemptible. As Biden packs his bags for his overdue retirement, he is rendering desperate last-minute services to the war racket that lies at the putrid heart of American capitalism. Last week, his Secretary of State Antony Blinken (another non-entity puppet) said the Biden administration would release a further $9 billion in military aid to Ukraine so that it could keep fighting the war well into next year. Likewise, the reported green light from Biden on the use of long-range missiles is another ploy to keep the war racket going. Trump could reverse the decision when he enters the White House, but over the next two months, the Biden administration seems to be trying to sabotage Trump’s peace intentions by escalating the conflict to a dangerous point of no return. Russia should not take the bait. For a start, the United States does not have a large supply of ATACMS to give to Ukraine. Any use of these missiles will be limited. The Kiev regime’s so-called president Vladimir Zelensky – he canceled elections months ago and rules by decree – has no chance of stopping the rapidly advancing victory of Russian forces, even with a few ATACMS. No, this is not about defending Ukraine or enabling Zelensky’s ridiculous 'victory plan'. It’s all about the American-led Western imperialist deep state wanting to provoke Russia into a dreadful escalation to keep the war profits churning. Biden’s gesture is reckless, but it is something that should be treated with contempt. As he wanders off to the oblivion of his retirement dementia, people will soon forget about this failed politician. His 50-year career was one long shift of prostituting for U.S. imperialism. Legally, Russia could respond to Biden’s provocation with reciprocal attacks on U.S. and NATO sites. But such an escalation is exactly what the imperialist deep state of the U.S. and its NATO lackeys are betting on. The provocative gesture is more symbolic than a substantive threat. Russia should ignore it and focus on demolishing the NATO proxy regime in Kiev, and with that, thereby deal a fatal blow to U.S. and NATO credibility.

From One ‘Ism’ To Another: The Artistic Evolution Through Time – ...	Art, as a mirror of society, evolves dynamically over time. Movements, or 'isms', influence one another through reactions, innovations, and reinterpretations. These shifts are not merely aesthetic; they often embody changing cultural, political, and technological landscapes. From the grandeur of the Renaissance to the provocations of modern and postmodern art, each era contributes to an ongoing dialogue. Movements build upon the ideas of their predecessors, either by challenging established norms or refining them. The 'isms' of art do not emerge from a vacuum; rather, they are the continuation of a rich tradition or traditions that stretch back to the ancient era. Ancient art is the foundation upon which many modern movements and techniques were built. Emerging in prehistoric times, art served not only as a form of personal expression but also as a means of documenting history, religion, and daily life. Early cave paintings, like those found in Lascaux, France, reveal humanity's desire to communicate and connect with the environment and the spiritual world. As civilizations developed, the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans refined their artistic techniques, focusing on idealized forms and proportionality. Egyptian art, for example, adhered to strict conventions to convey the eternity and order of life. Greek and Roman art, on the other hand, emphasized humanism, exploring themes of beauty, the human body, and the natural world in greater depth. The Gothic period (12th–16th centuries) marked another important shift, with a focus on spirituality, complex architecture, and the human experience. Figures such as Giotto di Bondone, whose naturalistic approach to painting marked a shift towards realism, and Abbot Suger, who played a pivotal role in the development of Gothic architecture through his work on the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, exemplify this era's innovations. Gothic art, particularly in cathedrals and stained glass, brought a new focus on light, verticality, and ornate detail. This style, deeply connected with religious themes, laid the foundation for the humanism of the Renaissance. Ancient and medieval art laid the groundwork for classical ideas that would later inspire Renaissance artists and beyond. From sculpture to pottery to murals, the flow of art demonstrates human creativity and the desire to represent and understand the world. The evolution of these early styles, though distinct in different regions, set the stage for the major movements that would follow, influencing generations of artists. Studying the progression of artistic movements, from ancient to modern times, offers invaluable insight into the evolving nature of human expression, culture, and society. Each 'ism' in art history reflects the unique concerns, ideologies, and advancements of its time, providing a window into the past and a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped civilization. By tracing the influence of one movement on another, we can better comprehend how cultural, political, and intellectual shifts influence creative expression. Art history also highlights the interplay between innovation and tradition, as artists respond to, reinterpret, or challenge established norms. Furthermore, understanding the lineage of art movements allows us to appreciate the enduring relevance of classical ideas and their transformation over time. These studies are not just about art for art's sake; they help us understand the broader social and psychological contexts in which these works were created. By studying art movements and their interconnections, we can cultivate a greater appreciation for how art shapes and reflects human history, inspiring future generations of artists and thinkers. This article explores influential transitions, shedding light on how one artistic philosophy inspires and informs the next, creating a continuous and interconnected history of creativity. Early Modern Movements 1. Renaissance → Mannerism The Renaissance celebrated realism, symmetry, and classical ideals, reaching its zenith through masters like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. However, Mannerism emerged as a response, pushing boundaries with elongated forms and exaggerated perspectives. Mannerist artists such as Pontormo and Parmigianino sought to explore emotional intensity and complexity, moving beyond the harmonious ideals of the Renaissance. This transition marked a shift towards more experimental, personal expressions of art, reflecting the tensions and uncertainties of the late 16th century. Mannerism, thus, challenged the structured beauty of the Renaissance, paving the way for new artistic explorations that embraced ambiguity and distortion. 2. Mannerism → Baroque Baroque art followed Mannerism, emphasizing grandeur, drama, and movement. Artists like Caravaggio used chiaroscuro to heighten emotional impact, while Bernini's sculptures conveyed intense energy and spirituality. Rooted in the Counter-Reformation, Baroque art aimed to inspire awe and devotion among viewers. This movement embraced Mannerism's emotional depth but balanced it with a sense of clarity and purpose. Baroque art's theatricality and dynamic compositions marked a dramatic shift, reflecting the religious and political fervor of the 17th century. Through its elaborate forms and striking visuals, Baroque became a powerful tool for storytelling and spiritual engagement. 3. Baroque → Rococo As the Baroque period waned, Rococo emerged in 18th-century France, shifting from grandeur to lighthearted elegance. Artists like Fragonard favored playful themes, pastel hues, and intricate ornamentation, reflecting the leisure and decadence of the French aristocracy. While Baroque art sought to inspire awe, Rococo emphasized intimacy and sensuality. The movement's decorative style extended to architecture and interior design, celebrating refinement and frivolity. However, Rococo's emphasis on indulgence faced criticism during the Enlightenment, setting the stage for the rise of Neoclassicism. Despite this, its focus on beauty and detail remains influential in decorative arts and design. 4. Rococo → Neoclassicism Neoclassicism arose as a reaction against Rococo's perceived excess, drawing inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art. Artists like Jacques-Louis David championed moral seriousness, simplicity, and symmetry, aligning with Enlightenment ideals. The movement reflected a broader cultural shift towards rationality and civic virtue, particularly during the French Revolution. Neoclassical art used clean lines and heroic themes to convey timeless values and universal truths. This transition from Rococo's frivolity to Neoclassicism's discipline mirrored changing societal priorities. By reviving classical antiquity, Neoclassicism established a foundation for modern art's emphasis on form and function. 5. Neoclassicism → Romanticism Romanticism emerged in the late 18th century as a counterpoint to Neoclassicism's rationality, celebrating emotion, nature, and individualism. Artists like Caspar David Friedrich and William Blake explored themes of the sublime, depicting nature as a source of beauty and terror. Romanticism also embraced subjectivity, imagination, and the mystical, challenging Enlightenment ideals. This movement reflected the upheavals of the Industrial Revolution and societal shifts towards personal freedom. By prioritizing the emotional and the transcendental, Romanticism influenced literature, music, and art, creating a profound legacy that continues to resonate in creative expression. Modern and Pre-Modern Movements 6. Romanticism → Realism Realism emerged as a reaction to Romanticism's idealism, focusing on everyday life and social realities. Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet depicted rural labor and ordinary people with unvarnished honesty, rejecting Romantic heroism. This movement reflected the societal changes brought by industrialization and urbanization, highlighting class struggles and human dignity. Realism's commitment to truth-telling laid the groundwork for modern art's explorations of contemporary themes. By turning attention to the mundane and the overlooked, Realism expanded art's scope, encouraging artists to engage with their environments and present authentic narratives. 7. Realism → Impressionism Building upon Realism's focus on contemporary life, Impressionism explored fleeting moments and the effects of light. Artists like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas painted en plein air, capturing the vibrancy of modernity in loose brushstrokes and vibrant palettes. Impressionism broke from academic traditions, prioritizing immediacy and sensory experience over meticulous detail. This movement reflected the rapid transformations of 19th-century urban life, including industrialization and leisure culture. By emphasizing spontaneity and movement, Impressionism paved the way for further experimentation, challenging conventions and inspiring future generations of artists. 8. Impressionism → Post-Impressionism Post-Impressionism extended Impressionism's innovations, emphasizing emotion, symbolism, and structure. Artists like Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin moved beyond capturing fleeting impressions, exploring deeper psychological and spiritual themes. Paul Cézanne's focus on form and geometry laid the foundation for Cubism, while van Gogh's emotive color use influenced Expressionism. This movement bridged the gap between Impressionism's lightness and modern art's abstraction. By reinterpreting Impressionist techniques, Post-Impressionists expanded the possibilities of visual storytelling, fostering a diverse range of artistic expressions that shaped the 20th-century avant-garde. 9. Post-Impressionism → Fauvism Inspired by Post-Impressionism's bold use of color, Fauvism emphasized emotional power and aesthetic freedom. Henri Matisse and André Derain used vivid, non-naturalistic colors to create works that resonated with energy and joy. Fauvism sought to liberate color from its descriptive function, focusing on its expressive potential. This movement rejected realism, embracing abstraction as a tool for personal and emotional exploration. Although short-lived, Fauvism's radical approach to color and form profoundly influenced later movements like Expressionism and Abstract Art, marking a turning point in the evolution of modern art. 10. Post-Impressionism → Expressionism Similarly, Expressionism built on Post-Impressionism's emotional depth, channeling personal and societal anxiety into bold, distorted imagery. Artists like Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele depicted raw emotion, often using dark palettes and exaggerated forms to convey existential themes. Expressionism reflected the turmoil of early 20th-century Europe, addressing themes of alienation and psychological conflict. This movement expanded the boundaries of artistic expression, paving the way for Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. By prioritizing emotion over realism, Expressionism inspired artists to explore the inner workings of the human psyche, fostering a profound legacy of introspective creativity. 20th Century Avant-Garde Movements 11. Expressionism → Surrealism Expressionism's exploration of emotion and psychological depth influenced Surrealism, which delved into the unconscious mind. Inspired by Freud's theories, Surrealist artists like Salvador Dalí and Max Ernst created dreamlike, fantastical images. Surrealism extended Expressionism's introspection, adding a focus on the irrational and the mysterious. While Expressionism depicted emotional struggles, Surrealism sought to visualize the hidden and surreal aspects of human experience. This movement celebrated the unpredictable, challenging traditional artistic boundaries. By combining Expressionism's intensity with new intellectual frameworks, Surrealism expanded the horizons of art, influencing not only visual mediums but also literature, film, and theater. 12. Fauvism → Cubism While Fauvism celebrated color, Cubism deconstructed form. Pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Cubism fragmented objects into geometric shapes, presenting multiple perspectives simultaneously. Fauvism's simplified forms inspired Cubism's break from realism, but Cubism pursued intellectual depth rather than Fauvism's emotive expression. This movement reflected the rapidly changing perceptions of space and time in the early 20th century, influenced by scientific advancements and industrialization. Cubism's innovative approach redefined art, inspiring Futurism, Abstract Art, and beyond. Its radical departure from tradition positioned it as one of the most influential movements in modern art. 13. Cubism → Futurism Cubism's fragmented representation of space and motion profoundly influenced Futurism, which celebrated speed, technology, and modernity. Italian artists like Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla embraced Cubist techniques to depict the dynamism of the machine age. Futurism extended Cubism's geometric abstraction, incorporating movement and energy into its compositions. This movement was deeply intertwined with the cultural and political fervor of early 20th-century Europe, reflecting the era's fascination with progress and innovation. By merging Cubism's aesthetic with a celebration of modernity, Futurism contributed to the avant-garde's ongoing redefinition of art's role in society. 14. Cubism → Abstract Art Cubism's reduction of form also influenced Abstract Art, which moved towards complete non-representation. Wassily Kandinsky, often credited as the first abstract painter, expanded on Cubism's innovations, focusing on the spiritual and emotional resonance of color and shape. Abstract Art rejected the need for recognizable subjects, emphasizing the expressive power of visual elements themselves. Inspired by Cubism's intellectual rigor, this movement opened new avenues for artistic exploration. By prioritizing abstraction, artists like Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian transformed art into a medium for universal ideas, laying the groundwork for countless modern movements. 15. Dadaism → Surrealism Dadaism's anti-establishment ethos and embrace of absurdity directly influenced Surrealism. Emerging during World War I, Dada artists like Marcel Duchamp rejected traditional art forms, instead using readymades and nonsensical works to critique societal norms. Surrealists adopted this rebellious spirit, channeling it into explorations of dreams and subconscious thought. While Dadaism embraced chaos and randomness, Surrealism sought to uncover deeper psychological truths. The two movements shared a disdain for conventional art, challenging viewers to question reality itself. By merging Dada's playfulness with intellectual depth, Surrealism created a lasting impact on modern art and culture. Abstract and Conceptual Developments 16. Suprematism → Constructivism Suprematism, led by Kazimir Malevich, emphasized pure geometric abstraction, stripping art of representational content. Constructivism built upon these principles, focusing on the practical application of abstract forms in design, architecture, and propaganda. Artists like Vladimir Tatlin used art to serve societal needs, aligning with the Russian Revolution's ethos. While Suprematism prioritized spiritual purity, Constructivism embraced functionality and materiality. This transition reflected a broader shift in art's purpose, moving from individual expression to collective utility. By merging abstraction with practicality, Constructivism laid the foundation for modern design and industrial aesthetics. 17. Constructivism → De Stijl Constructivism's geometric rigor influenced De Stijl, a movement dedicated to achieving universal harmony through abstraction. Artists like Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg reduced forms to vertical and horizontal lines, using primary colors to create balanced compositions. De Stijl expanded on Constructivism's ideas, seeking to integrate art, architecture, and design into a cohesive aesthetic. This movement reflected the modernist desire for order and clarity in a rapidly industrializing world. By focusing on simplicity and universality, De Stijl shaped modern art and design, influencing movements like the Bauhaus and Minimalism. 18. De Stijl → Bauhaus The Bauhaus movement drew heavily from De Stijl's minimalist aesthetic, combining art with functionality. Founded by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to unify creative disciplines, integrating art, design, and architecture. De Stijl's emphasis on geometric abstraction informed Bauhaus principles, particularly in its approach to modernist design. Bauhaus artists like Paul Klee and Josef Albers expanded these ideas, applying them to mass production and industrial design. This movement revolutionized art education and practice, emphasizing the intersection of beauty and utility. By adapting De Stijl's ideals, the Bauhaus became a cornerstone of 20th-century modernism. 19. Bauhaus → Minimalism Minimalism grew out of Bauhaus principles, embracing simplicity, form, and function. Artists like Donald Judd and Agnes Martin reduced art to its essential elements, stripping away ornamentation. Minimalism rejected narrative and symbolism, focusing instead on materiality and spatial relationships. The movement reflected Bauhaus ideas about industrial design, but it also responded to Abstract Expressionism's emotive excess. By prioritizing clarity and precision, Minimalism reshaped contemporary art, architecture, and design. Its influence extends beyond the visual arts, permeating fields like fashion, music, and technology. 20. Abstract Expressionism → Pop Art Abstract Expressionism's bold, emotive gestures influenced Pop Art's dynamic imagery. Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein adapted the scale and immediacy of Abstract Expressionism but replaced abstraction with recognizable cultural symbols. Pop Art celebrated consumer culture and mass media, critiquing post-war materialism. This movement merged high and low art, reflecting the changing nature of modern society. By reinterpreting Abstract Expressionism's techniques in a commercial context, Pop Art created a new visual language, bridging the avant-garde and popular culture. Postmodern and Contemporary Movements 21. Pop Art → Postmodernism Pop Art's critique of consumer culture set the stage for Postmodernism's broader challenge to traditional narratives. Postmodern artists embraced pastiche, irony, and fragmentation, rejecting the notion of universal truth. Movements like Neo-Pop and Appropriation Art drew directly from Pop Art's playfulness and critique. By deconstructing cultural symbols, Postmodernism questioned authority and celebrated diversity. This transition reflected shifting societal attitudes towards pluralism and subjectivity. Postmodernism's legacy continues to shape contemporary art, design, and media. 22. Minimalism → Conceptual Art Minimalism's emphasis on essential forms influenced Conceptual Art, which prioritized ideas over physical objects. Artists like Sol LeWitt and Joseph Kosuth focused on intellectual engagement, using text, instructions, and ephemeral materials to convey meaning. This movement redefined the art object, challenging viewers to rethink traditional notions of creativity and authorship. By expanding Minimalism's reductive approach, Conceptual Art opened new possibilities for artistic expression, influencing installation, performance, and digital art. 23. Conceptual Art → Performance Art Conceptual Art's focus on ideas extended into Performance Art, where the artist's body and actions became the medium. Marina Abramović and Yoko Ono used performance to explore themes of identity, endurance, and audience interaction. Performance Art rejected static forms, emphasizing temporality and experience. This transition reflected a broader shift towards participatory and experiential art. By merging Conceptual Art's intellectualism with live action, Performance Art created a new dialogue between artist and viewer. 24. Performance Art → Installation Art Performance Art's immersive qualities influenced Installation Art, which engaged viewers in spatial and sensory experiences. Artists like Olafur Eliasson and Yayoi Kusama created environments that blurred the boundaries between art and audience. Installation Art expanded the scope of artistic practice, incorporating light, sound, and technology. This movement reflected a desire to create holistic, multisensory experiences. By building on Performance Art's dynamism, Installation Art transformed how audiences interact with art, redefining its role in contemporary culture. 25. Surrealism → Psychedelic Art Surrealism's exploration of altered realities inspired the vibrant, fantastical imagery of Psychedelic Art in the 1960s. Artists embraced vivid colors, swirling forms, and mystical themes, reflecting countercultural movements and interest in altered states of consciousness. This movement reinterpreted Surrealism's dreamlike qualities, infusing them with a sense of rebellion and experimentation. Psychedelic Art's influence extended beyond visual media, shaping music, fashion, and graphic design. Conclusion: The Ever-Evolving Continuum of Art Art movements are rarely isolated phenomena; they are threads in a larger tapestry of human expression. Each 'ism' carries the DNA of its predecessors while carving new paths for the future. This interconnectedness not only reflects the evolution of artistic thought but also mirrors broader cultural, social, and technological transformations. As artists continue to innovate, the legacy of past movements ensures that the dialogue between tradition and experimentation remains vibrant and enduring.

Time For A Regional Response To An Emboldened Trump – OpEd	When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, the conventional wisdom was that we should take him seriously but not literally. This time, we ought to take him literally, too. Since his victory, he has announced a number of appointments — Robert F Kennedy for Health Secretary; Pete Hegseth for Defence; Marco Rubio for State; and Michael Waltz as National Security Adviser, to name a few — that suggests that the major ruptures promised during his campaign are likely to come to pass. Trump’s economic objectives are mutually incoherent: he wants to replace income taxes with tariffs, rebuild American manufacturing and keep inflation low. But the more effective his tariffs are in promoting domestic industries, the less revenue they will raise; conversely, if he wants to keep tariff revenue high and inflation in check, the only way would be an appreciation of the dollar which would hurt American manufacturers. Prepare, then, for a confused set of economic policies in Trump’s second term, and a transactional foreign policy that seeks flashy ‘wins’, probably at the expense of American strategic dominance. In many Asian capitals, the reaction to Trump’s return to the White House has been relatively sanguine. Trump’s first time posed major challenges for the region, of course, but the savvier leaders — former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe chief among them — learned to play on both his vanity and his venality to get by. His trade war with China caused great disruption to the most important economic relationship in the world, but it also created opportunities for other economies, most notably Vietnam, which saw major increases in American demand for the kinds of consumption good markets in which it already specialised and in which Chinese competitors had been rendered uncompetitive by Trump’s tariffs. But it would be a mistake for individual Asian countries to ignore the kind of damage that Trump is likely to do to the global system in the interests of securing a favoured position at Trump’s court. Indeed, the biggest danger for the region would be for each country alone to try to strike their own bargain with Trump. This was more or less the approach taken in the first Trump presidency, and as Shiro Armstrong argues in this week’s lead article, it was a tactical victory for some but a strategic bust for Asia as a whole. The World Trade Organization has still not recovered from the damage done by a bipartisan string of US Presidents, beginning with Obama, who have blocked the appointment of new appellate judges and left the WTO’s rule-enforcing power neutered. Former Director-General of the WTO Pascal Lamy has called for a broad front between the European Union and China to help protect global trade under Trump, but with powerful protectionist forces aligning in Brussels and deep distrust in Beijing, building such a coalition will be fraught. The region with the most to lose from an even more aggressively protectionist Trump is Asia, and so it is to Asia that the world looks for leadership in protecting the system of rules and institutions that have done so much to promote economic growth in Asia and in the world in general since 1945. The temptation for big players that are likely to be targeted by Trump again — most importantly, China and the European Union — will be to play tit-for-tat and retaliate with tariffs. While this may solve some domestic political problems, the economic effects of a generalised trade war would be devastating, particularly in Asia. Asia’s middle powers, Armstrong argues, need to mobilise to convince major powers that retaliation is not in their own interests. Trump’s wrong-headed policies will be their own punishment: there is no need for China to try to inflict more. Far more important, for China (which lacks allies) and for Asia more generally, is that the global trade system is insulated as best as possible from the deleterious effects of Trump’s almost guaranteed efforts to sabotage it. This will not be easy. Faith in Beijing’s good intentions is still at a low point, particularly following China’s naked attempts to coerce countries like Australia in recent years. Yet, as Armstrong notes, the institutional foundations for this kind of effort exist already, even if they need reinforcing: ASEAN-centred institutions like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in Asia need to be connected to European collective action. The stakes are high enough that a concerted effort from middle powers across Asia to stitch together a collective response to protectionist provocation in the United States is worth the diplomatic trouble. ‘The multilateral trading system is the biggest source of economic security for open trading nations’, Armstrong argues, and in a world that is fracturing on geopolitical lines, strengthening the open economic order is not just an economic mission, it is a national security imperative as well.

Contrasting Expectations For A Russia-Ukraine Settlement – OpEd	In his dramatic shift away from arming the Kiev regime, Donald Trump's Secretary of State Marko Rubio says he's now against funding a 'stalemate' concerning the NATO proxy war against Russia. The use of the word stalemate misrepresents the actual situation in a way that serves to prolong a conflict which Trump correctly said should've never happened. Since February 24, 2022, the start of Russia's Special Miliary Operation (SMO), the Russian military has qualitatively and quantitively gotten stronger with the Kiev regime going in reverse. During this same period, Russia's economy has fared comparably better than that of the EU. For all practical purposes, the Kiev regime doesn't have a functioning economy. In the US, the overall population face considerable socioeconomic challenges and is therefore reluctant to see massive aid going to Project Ukraine. This is a key motivating reason for Trump's resounding victory over the Democratic Party establishment. A limited American military engagement abroad enables a Trump administration concentration on US domestic concerns. In his changed position, Rubio notes that Ukraine is better off with a practical peace settlement which maintains the former Soviet republic as a functioning state. The US foreign policy establishment peace proposals are out of whack with reality. Shortly before Trump's decisive victory, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass, gave an unrealistic commentary in Foreign Affairs. Contrary to Haass, Russia has already rejected the idea of a ceasefire for the purpose of building up Kiev regime military capability, as well as a 10-20 year wait on whether Ukraine can join NATO. As the party winning and most likely to win the NATO proxy war against it, Russia will have a great say on the settlement terms. Haass' selective BS (when applied to Russia) about ethically not redrawing boundaries via force is pretty rich given what NATO has done regarding Kosovo. Borders continue to be redrawn elsewhere via armed conflict. South Sudan is a recent example. In the not-too-distant past, Germany was reunified after it had been forcefully separated. Hence, it's not so out of the ordinary for some culturally, historically, linguistically and religiously Russian territory to be reunited. Mirroring Haass, New York former Republican Governor Geroge Pataki said on a November 12 WABC New York Talk Radio show (at the 40:24 mark) that aggression shouldn't be rewarded. He wasn't referring to neocon, neolib, neo-Nazi Banderite aggression. Rather, an overly selective and inaccurate overview on his part. The Hungarian-American Pataki is no Viktor Orban or Péter Szijjártó. Among the considerably better American commentators getting some establishment play, there's room for valid disagreement. James Webb of the Quincy Institute is the brilliant son of a former US Secretary of the Navy and Virginia Senator. In a November 12 segment on The Duran (at the 1:00:38 mark), Webb spoke of a hypothetical geopolitical exchange involving a Russian military withdrawal from Syria. For the purpose of satisfying Western neocon and neolib feelings, there's no need for this. Russia's number of military bases in the Middle East and elsewhere dwarfs that of the US. In Syria, the Russian armed presence is welcomed by the internationally recognized Syrian government unlike the current US troop deployment there. The secular Syrian government (which BTW is preferred by the majority of Syrian Christians) sought Russian, Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah help in combating Sunni extremists affiliated with either ISIS or Al Qaeda. Even with the Russian settlement terms, the collective Western foreign policy establishment can brag (albeit erroneously) about: - NATO adding two new members (Finland and Sweden, thus further extending itself) - how Putin didn't take all of Ukraine (not that he ever actually attempted to do such). At this time, a Russian proposed settlement is along these lines: - strictly adhered to Ukrainian neutrality, with a limited Ukrainian armed forces - all of Zaporozhe, Donetsk, Lugansk and Kherson going to Russia - end of SMO related sanctions against Russia - complete release of Russian 'frozen' (stolen) assets - protection of Russian identity (like language use) within Ukraine's Communist drawn boundary - discussion on a new Euro-Atlantic security arrangement. A year ago, the Kiev regime could've gotten a better deal. Going back further, the Minsk Accords was an even better option for it. The longer the proxy war against Russia continues, the greater the likelihood of the Kiev regime losing more Ukrainian territory. Don't be fooled by the clownishly pompous likes of Sebastian Gorka. On a November 16 RT aired show (at the 15:45 mark), Gorka said that if Russia refused a Trump peace proposal, the incoming US president will flood Ukraine with arms. Like Pataki, the Brit-Hungarian-American Gorka is no Orban or Szijjártó. Seasoned military analysts including Daniel Davis, Jacques Baud, Brian Berletic, Lawrence Wilkerson, Douglas Macgregor, Mark Sleboda and Scott Ritter, have conclusively shown how the Collective West is pretty much tapped out on what it can (within reason) militarily provide the Kiev regime, in conjunction with a dwindling number of available Kiev regime armed forces personnel. Daniel Davis has astutely detailed why the recently reported move by the Biden administration isn't going to change the eventual outcome.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUEc9vuLKzxCG	2024-11-18T16:47:46-08:00	
New Administration, New Outlook And New Action On Myanmar – OpEd	With the conclusion of the 60th U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump declared the 47th president, all eyes are on the incoming administration’s approach to domestic and foreign affairs when it assumes office on January 20, 2025. It’s essential to objectively observe the changes to come, as the campaign season was marked by bold rhetoric and sensational media coverage. While domestic economic priorities remain critical, the Trump administration faces equally daunting challenges on the global stage. As a leader in addressing crises worldwide, the U.S. must respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war in Gaza, terrorist activities in the Middle East, nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, and increasing strategic tensions with China—a dominant global economy and rising military power. The nominations of China hardliners Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State and Representative Tim Waltz as National Security Adviser indicate a tough stance on China, including security issues that extend beyond trade and tariffs. 1 However, Donald Trump is unlikely to pursue direct confrontation with Xi Jinping. Instead, his administration may adopt a restrained strategy, recognizing that American resources are finite and should be directed where they matter most. This approach could focus on countering China’s assertive actions in the Pacific by empowering allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia to maintain regional stability.2 While the U.S. concentrates on the South China Sea as a critical region for national security, Myanmar represents a significant oversight. For China, Myanmar provides vital access to the Indian Ocean, offering an alternative trade route to bypass the Strait of Malacca. Myanmar also plays a key role in the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As Myanmar’s largest investor, China seeks to dominate the region to protect its interests, including securing rare earth element (REE) imports from Myanmar. China sourced 72% of the U.S.'s REE imports in 2022. A shortage of REE essential for military and technological advancements would be considered a potential chokepoint for U.S. national security. However, since Myanmar's military ousted its democratically elected government on February 1st, 2021, the country has been engulfed in conflict. A nationwide resistance movement has united ethnic groups and opposition factions into a coalition against the junta’s oppressive regime, ushering in what is now called the Spring Revolution. Initially, China has maintained backdoor diplomacy with various factions while ensuring minimal U.S. involvement. Although it seeks to maximize influence, Beijing opposes the junta's collapse, fearing National Unity Government (NUG), which it perceived as a pro-Western, could gain power. 3,4 Since late 2023 and early 2024, the military has lost control of 60% of the territories of the country. In response, China has become more proactive, pressuring resistance forces for ceasefires, blocking imports, and tightening border controls. China has reportedly proposed establishing a joint security company with military regime to ensure the safety of Chinese projects and personnel. The news followed a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and junta chief Min Aung Hlaing on August 14, 2024. The report has raised fears of potential Chinese troop involvement in Myanmar through this proposed security company.5On November 6, 2024, Myanmar’s junta leader met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Kunming, Yunnan. Li expressed support for Myanmar's 'political reconciliation and transformation' to advance the construction of CMEC under the BRI.6 The Biden administration condemned the coup, imposed targeted sanctions, and supported limited humanitarian assistance. Senator Marco Rubio joined three other bipartisan members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in issuing a letter to urge President Joe Biden to help preserve democracy in Myanmar by outlining the key steps including to call for the immediate release of political prisoners and impose targeted sanctions on the senior leadership of the military and affiliated individuals.7 The US and Western democracies are providing important, but limited engagements on humanitarian assistance and advocacy for democracy despite the Burma Act passed in December 2022, that provides a framework for engagement and support for democracy in Myanmar. The US, EU, UK and Canada imposed targeted sanctions with limited impact on coffer for military to acquire jet fuels and weapons due to piecemeal implementation and lack of cooperation from the neighbors. China, India and ASEAN will now through combination of persuasion and pressure have proposed so called 'all-inclusive dialogue' about cease-fire, humanitarian aid, and sham elections that lack credibility. These initiatives will face colossal failure just like the Five-Point Consensus since the military will not accept to abandon its political dominance, kleptocratic-economic conglomerate and centralization dogma. The negotiated settlement will not succeed unless the military accepts civilian oversight and relinquishes its involvement in politics and impunity. Meanwhile, lost time due to the endless empty talks will prolong civilian suffering with no end to the military’s reign of terror against its own population.8 The new Trump administration must recognize the Myanmar crisis as a war of terror by the junta against its people, rather than a conflict between political factions. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces aligns with a restrained strategy in neutralizing China’s unchecked influence in the region. The U.S. should lead by formally recognizing the NUG. This move would encourage ASEAN, Western democracies, and neighboring countries to follow suit, fostering meaningful dialogue among anti-junta stakeholders, delivering humanitarian aid, and enforcing coordinated effective sanctions to cut off the junta’s resources. Empowering the NUG would allow Myanmar to break free from China’s shadow, consolidate resistance groups, and establish good governance and monetary institutions in liberated areas. This approach could deter Myanmar from becoming a failed state or a rogue regime like North Korea. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces offers the U.S. a low-cost, high-reward opportunity to counter China’s influence in Southeast Asia. A decisive, transparent policy that strengthens partnerships with allies and communicates effectively with Beijing would signal that the U.S. seeks balance, not Cold War-style dominance, in the region. 9 By prioritizing Myanmar, the U.S. could bolster regional security, promote democracy, and neutralize China’s monopoly in Southeast Asia, securing strategic gains for the U.S. in the era of heightened competition between the world’s two most powerful nations.9 References:	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUNJTUwvZPZ9O	2024-11-18T16:45:50-08:00	
Thank You For Emitting: The Hypocrisies Of COP29 – OpEd	COP29 was always going to be memorable, for no other reason than the hosting country, Azerbaijan, is a petrostate indifferent to the issue of emissions and scornful of ecological preachers. It has seen its natural gas supply grow by 128% between 2000 and 2021. Between 2006 and 2021, gas exports rose by a monumental 29,290%. A dizzying 95% of the country’s exports are made up of oil and gas, with much of its wealth failing to trickle down to the rest of the populace. The broadly described West, as stated by President Ilham Aliyev in his opening address to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was in no position to be lecturing his country about cutting back on the use of fossil fuels. They were, he grandly claimed, 'a gift from God'. In this, he should have surprised no one. In April 2024, he declared that, as a leader of a country 'which is rich in fossil fuels, of course, we will defend the right of these countries to continue investments and to continue production.' A few days later, Aliyev played the other side of the climate change divide, suggesting at a meeting with island leaders that France and the Netherlands had been responsible for 'brutally' suppressing the 'voices' of communities in such overseas territories as Mayotte and Curaçao concerned with climate change. (Aliyev himself is no stranger to suppressing, with dedicated brutality, voices of dissent within his own country.) This proved too much for France’s Ecological Transition Minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who cancelled her planned attendance to the summit while attacking Baku for 'instrumentalising the fight against climate change for its undignified personal agenda.' On the second day of the summit, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, tried to turn the attention of delegates to the urgent matter at hand. 'The sound you hear is the ticking clock – we are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and time is not on our side.' Others, however, heard the sound of money changing hands, with the fossil fuel industry lurking, fangs and pens at the ready, presided over by the good offices of a petrostate. In the background lie assessments of gloomy inevitability. The Climate Change Tracker’s November 2024 briefing notes this year was one characterised by 'minimal progress, with almost no new national climate change targets (NDCs) or net zero pledges even though government have agreed to (urgently) strengthen their 2030 targets and to align them with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.' As easy as it is to rage against the opportunistic Aliyev, who crudely blends environmentalism with ethnic cleansing, few attending the summit in Baku come with clean hands. As with previous COP events, Baku offers another enormous event of emitters and emission, featuring tens of thousands of officials, advisors and minders bloviating in conference. That said, the 67,000 registrants at this conference is somewhat lower compared with the 83,000 who descended on Dubai at COP28. The plane tracking website FlightRadar24 noted that 65 private jets landed in the Azerbaijani capital prior to the summit, prompting Alethea Warrington, the head of energy, aviation and heat at Possible, a climate action charity, to tut with heavy disapproval: 'Travelling by private jet is a horrendous waste of the world’s scarce remaining carbon budget, with each journey producing more emissions in a few hours than the average person around the world emits in an entire year.' COP29 is also another opportunity to strike deals that have little to do with reducing emissions and everything to do with advancing the interests of lobby groups and companies in the energy market, much of it of a fossil fuel nature. In the spirit of Dubai, COP29 is set to follow in the footsteps of the wily Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who chaired COP28 in Dubai. Prior to the arrival of the chatterati of climate change last year, the Sultan was shown in leaked briefing documents to the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) to be an avid enthusiast for advancing the business of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). It was hard to avoid the glaring fact that Al Jaber is also the CEO of Adnoc. The documents in question involve over 150 pages of briefings prepared by the COP28 team for meetings with Jaber and various interested parties held between July and October this year. They point to plans to raise matters of commercial interest with as many as 30 countries. The CCR confirms 'that on at least one occasion a nation followed up on commercial discussions brought up in a meeting with Al Jaber; a source with knowledge of discussions also told CCR that Adnoc’s business interests were allegedly raised during a meeting with another country.' The COP29 chairman, Samir Nuriyev, had already put out feelers as early as March this year that a 'fair approach' was needed when approaching countries abundant with oil and natural gas, notably in light of their purported environmental policies. He went so far as to argue that Azerbaijan was an ideal interlocutor between the Global South and Global North. His colleague and chief executive of the COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, showed exactly how that process would work in a secret recording ahead of the conference in which he discusses 'investment opportunities' in the state oil and gas company with a person posing as a potential investor. (The person in question purported to be representing a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm with a sharp line in energy.) 'We have a lot of gas fields that are to be developed,' Soltanov insists. 'We will have a certain amount of oil and gas being produced, perhaps forever.' In many ways, the Baku gathering has all the hallmarks of a criminal syndicate meeting, held under more open conditions. Fair play, then, to the Azerbaijani hosts for working out the climate change racket, taking the lead from Dubai last year. Aliyev and company noted months in advance that this was less a case of being a theatre of the absurd than a forum for business. And so, it is proving to be.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUKnu0p5u7YVZ	2024-11-18T16:43:44-08:00	
Indo-Pacific Strategies Of BRICS And The Quad: Digitalization As ...	The recent 16th BRICS Summit, held in October of this year, gave fresh momentum to the group's digital and geopolitical strategies, especially in the Indo-Pacific. The outcome of this summit is likely to have direct implications for the core themes of digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, and the ongoing competition with the Quad. The summit also announced the inclusion of Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE, into its fold, thus promising to strengthen BRICS' outreach into regions that have high digital infrastructure potential. Russia announced its framework for the Digital Silk Road, which ties directly into creating a parallel digital ecosystem across member states. This expanded BRICS connectivity plan could rival Quad-led infrastructure projects like the Blue Dot Network, especially in underserved areas of the Indo-Pacific. Quad's focus on open, secure, and resilient infrastructure may face stiffer competition now as BRICS consolidates its influence through larger membership and shared resources. These raise a few questions: how will the inclusion of new BRICS members reshape the digital landscape in the Indo-Pacific? How will Quad nations respond to BRICS' ambitions in cybersecurity and digital infrastructure? The Quad strategically focuses on the Indo-Pacific with a primary focus on security in the Indo-Pacific, countering China’s growing influence, and promoting a free, open, and inclusive region. On the other hand, BRICS is not strictly Indo-Pacific-centric. However, China and India, key BRICS members, have major stakes in the area. Russia, through its 'pivot to Asia' strategy, has also increased engagement. Such an architecture creates indirect interactions, as BRICS and Quad member states pursue their objectives in the same geographic theater. While the US’s 'pivot to Asia' is a counterbalancing mechanism to contain the resurgent China, Russia’s strategy is to diversify from the West and strengthen ties with Asia. QUAD is often seen as a security alliance, though it lacks formalized military commitments. India is both in the BRICS and QUAD groupings and this puts it in a unique position to exercise what is known as ‘strategic autonomy’. In the Quad, India aligns with democracies like the US, Japan, and Australia to address security concerns, particularly about maritime security cooperation and China’s rise in the Indo-Pacific. At BRICS, India collaborates with emerging economies, this time again with China, to address different sets of issues about global economic and development challenges and emphasize a multipolar world order. To an extent, India has been utilizing this unique presence in both groups to balance its security interests with its economic and geopolitical priorities and often acting as a bridge between the Global North (Quad) and Global South (BRICS). See Fig 1: the network graph illustrating India’s association. Fig 1: India is a member of both BRICS and QUAD groupings In discussions at the recent BRICS summit there was increased emphasis on technological collaboration in AI. China's leadership has potentially set the tone for other members to take an interest in this. The UAE, which has a strong focus on AI development ( it is also ranked among the top nations in AI readiness), has brought added expertise to the table, bolstering BRICS' collective capabilities. AI-driven innovations have significant potential that could enhance BRICS' ability to offer competitive digital solutions in the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, Quad nations may need to accelerate their AI initiatives to counter BRICS' collective technological capabilities, especially as AI becomes a decisive factor in digital economies. In light of Russia and China advocating state-controlled cyberspaces, the BRICS summit's emphasis on cybersecurity frameworks directly aligns with the group's push for digital sovereignty. The proposed collaboration on cyber threat mitigation could be strategic and has the potential of establishing BRICS as a significant player in the global cybersecurity dialogue, challenging Quad-led initiatives. Cybersecurity discussions also included creating suitable safeguards against interference in national data systems, impacting Indo-Pacific digital trust networks. Quad's collaborative cyber defense efforts may need to scale up to address the increasing sophistication of BRICS-led frameworks. BRICS reassured its commitment to strengthening digital economies through projects like the New Development Bank (NDB)'s digital transformation and digital infrastructure programs. NDB, formally known as the BRICS Development Bank, finances infrastructure and sustainable development projects of emerging economies. In the meeting, there was particular emphasis on collaboration in blockchain and fintech-related areas. This initiative positions BRICS as a strong contender in shaping the Indo-Pacific’s digital economy. In contrast, Quad nations may need to bolster their digital economy projects in the region to counter BRICS' growing influence in areas such as digital payment systems. With an expanded membership, BRICS could further facilitate more widespread adoption of 'BRICS-driven technologies' in the Indo-Pacific. Huawei has been continuing to lead 5G projects among BRICS member states. Hence Quad must focus on secure and transparent 5G networks. This is crucial if it has to counter BRICS' technological advancements. There are some issues with Quad's digital openness model. The model may need to articulate clearer policies on balancing sovereignty and openness to maintain its influence in the Indo-Pacific. In contrast, the BRICS summit’s focus on digital sovereignty has underscored the importance of national control over cyberspace. In the current summit, the discussions included how dependence on US-led tech ecosystems could be reduced. Its expanded membership and push for advanced AI and cybersecurity initiatives, highlight a comprehensive strategy that could challenge Quad's dominance. This evolving rivalry highlights the urgent need for a deeper analysis of how digitalization shapes geopolitics in this critical region. There is a variation in the strategies of 'technology as a geopolitical tool' with a focus on two groups of countries embedded in different (yet interconnected) geopolitical contexts, namely the Quad and BRICS. As a result of this commitment to technology, both groups have developed respective strategies that cast technology as a geopolitical tool. The BRICS Strategy for Economic Partnership employs soft measures to reach geopolitical goals by setting rule-based cooperation frameworks in the developing part of the continent and using global cooperation law. The strategy was directed mostly at China, scaling up its involvement in these directions. The actors of the Quad, in contrast, have much less commitment toward developing such initiatives, and thus they use hard power measures to attain geopolitical aims - a comprehensive approach to allocate diplomatic pressure and funds for reducing China’s influence in these regions as an answer to its earlier policies. On the one hand, BRICS, the relative latecomer, attempts to push digitalization further in the direction of multipolarity, promoting inter-civilizational dialogue, developing cooperative formats with African nations, and providing digital access to those left out or marginalized by the major digital platforms. On the other hand, the Indo-Pacific Quad exhibits the efforts invested by the rising powers in promoting their strategies for digitalization in the regional architectural space as a statement of their ability to shape regional dynamics. As a geopolitical tool, the alliances within and between BRICS and the Quad are distinct. While intra-quad pacts are non-binding, the one signed with the EU has also gained significance because it is format-exclusive. Intra-BRICS arrangements, on the other hand, are binding owing to the multilateral nature, interests, and responsibilities of the signatory states. The difference between the two regional digital strategies is not only about ideology but also about interests and forces that drive the geopolitics of connectivity and digitalization. As a leading member, China shapes BRICS’ agenda to align with its interests, often countering Western hegemony. Quad, on the other hand, explicitly seeks to counterbalance China’s assertive actions in the Indo-Pacific. India’s presence in both groups reflects its practical approach to balancing competition with cooperation. Future research may help in gauging how the relative power structure may indeed begin changing once digital generations, beyond 5G, take an avowed center stage. For instance, hypothesizing how a post-quantum world or scenarios where pervasive AI comes into play may produce different structural and systemic realities. It is suggested that while there may indeed be areas as this trend develops, where BRICS countries and Quad members may incipiently end up cooperating, future scenarios, given the terrain, may also reveal that both camps may primarily and increasingly be juxtaposed against each other as they promote their 'digital' strategies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUOroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-18T16:41:37-08:00	
Tectonic Shift In Sri Lankan Tamil Politics – Analysis	In the November 14 Sri Lankan parliamentary elections, the minority Tamils broke away from ethnic parties and supported the all-island, left wing, National Peoples' Power (NPP) in a tectonic political shift. As predicted by most, the National Peoples' Power (NPP) swept the Sinhala-dominated areas of Sri Lanka in the November 14 parliamentary elections. The NPP had the reputation of being a Sinhala nationalist party and its fortunes were on the upswing given the alienation of the other national parties from the public. But what came as a surprise was the NPP's sterling performance in the Tamil and Muslim-dominated areas of North and East Sri Lanka. Breaking with a seven-decade tradition, Sri Lankan Tamils flocked to the all-island National Peoples' Power (NPP) party in preference to ethnic Tamil parties, including the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK). Concern for good governance appears to have weighed in substantially. Mobilisation on traditional Tamil political issues like provincial autonomy through the full implementation of the 13th., amendment and accountability for alleged war crimes etc., had weakened. Instead, faith was reposed in the NPP's promise to give a clean, people-oriented government. The NPP put the Tamils' favourite party, the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), in the shade, and emerged as the number one choice in many of the electorates in the Tamil and Muslim-dominated Northern and Eastern provinces. The NPP's performance was impressive especially taking into account the fact that the party was a total 'outsider' to the area. It was a 'Sinhalese' party witch had no presence at all in the Tamil-dominated North ever before. For most of its life, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which is the core of the NPP, had campaigned against devolution of power to the Tamils. It was dead against the 13 th., Amendment. It rejected the Tamils charge of 'war crimes' against the armed forces. Even in its election manifesto, the NPP did not commit itself to meeting any of the traditional Tamil demands. It only said that all issues of national importance will be taken up when the new parliament discusses a new constitution for the country. NPP's Dominance in North and East In Vaddukoddai, in Jaffna district, which had been an ITAK stronghold, the NPP got the single largest number of votes - 21.5%. The All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) came second with 13.48%; and the ITAK came third with 13.39%. In Kankesanthurai also, the NPP was in the forefront with 13.37% of the votes. The ITAK got 12.57%; and the ACTC 7.15%. In Manipay, the share of votes had NPP at the top with 30.94%; and ITAK at number two with 13.49%. In Koppai, the NPP secured 29.86% and the ITAK 12.63%. The score in Uddipiddy was NPP 20.16% and ITAK 15.07%. In Point Pedro too, the NPP came first with 21.89 % and the ITAK second with 19.71%. In Nallur, a Hindu stronghold, the NPP came first with 31.44% and ITAK third with 11.49%. In Jaffna proper, NPP came first with 41.46% and ITAK second with 11.81%. However, in Kayts, the NPP got less than the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP). In Chavakachery, an Independent Group for the maximum number of votes. In Kilinochchi, ITAK President S.Sritharan's pocket borough, the ITAK bagged 43.79% of the votes and came first. The NPP came second with 16.39%. In Kalkuda in Batticaloa district in the Eastern province, the ITAK was the top scorer with 28.10 %. But in Batticaloa town, the NPP was first with 27.11% with the ITAK and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress were slightly behind. In Paddiruppu, the strong hold of the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puigam (TMVP), the NPP stood third. In Trincomalee District, which is ethnically mixed, the NPP got the largest percentage of votes in both Seruvila and Trincomalee town, cornering 56% and 40% respectively. In Mutur, the NPP came second to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). In Digamadulla (Ampara) district, the NPP was the top scorer in Amparai town, Sammanthurai and Kalmunai. It was second to the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) in Pottuvil. NPP's Tamil winners Though a hard line Sinhala party, the NPP put up Tamil candidates in areas where the Tamils were concentrated and made many of them win. In Nuwara Eliya, NPP's candidate Krishnan Kalaiselvi was one of the winners. In Matara, deep in the Sinhala South, an NPP Tamil candidate, Saroja Savithri Paulraj was among the winners. In the Wanni, the NPP managed to get two of its Tamil candidates elected in the six seats up for grabs. In Batticaloa, its candidate K.Prabhu bagged one of the five seats. In Badulla, NPP got 2 Tamils elected –K.Selvaraj and S. Ambika in the nine-seat electoral district. In Ratnapura, NPP got S. Pradeep elected to one of the 11 seats. In Jaffna, three of NPP candidates (all Tamils) won. The ITAK and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress got only one each. Ethnic Nationalisms on the backburner While the NPP did not play up Sinhala nationalism in its campaign, the Tamil parties played up Tamil nationalist demands like federalism, accountability for alleged war-time atrocities, vacation of military-occupied lands and the full implementation of the 13 th.Amendment for more power devolution. But a substantial section of voters appeared to have overlooked the contentious ethnic issues and pitched for better governance, less corruption and more people-centred development which were promised by the NPP. Tamils voted for the NPP despite the fact the NPP's election manifesto had nothing to say on the Tamils' ethnic issues as such. It promised a new constitution, but left its contents vague, leaving the issue to be tackled by the new parliament. Though this was neither here nor there, the Tamils voted for the NPP because their attention was elsewhere, namely, on their deteriorating economic circumstances created by the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic crisis of 2022. They were desperately in need of a government which would give them some relief. It is not clear as to how the NPP government will bring relief to the people given the lack of financial resources, the dependence on foreign aid and debt repayment obligations. Ahilan Kadirgamar, a professor at the University of Jaffna told Frontlinemagazine that the lands released from military occupation in the Northern Province could be developed by local cooperatives with a local village level official drawing up plans for their development and use. Development of this kind will be 'bottom up' and not 'top down', as is the case now. Development efforts will then be more effective. Most importantly, the NPP, being a hard core Sinhalese or Sri Lankan nationalist party, can take bold steps to bring about ethnic reconciliation because it cannot be accused of being anti-Sinhala or anti-Sri Lankan, Kadirgamar pointed out. The Tamils could make use the window of opportunities which is open now, to realize their reasonable demands within the frame of Sri Lanka's constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfiBFfJIv0eUMQ36glFESvq	2024-11-18T16:37:27-08:00	
What Donald Trump’s Administrative Picks Mean For US Foreign Poli...	By Majda Ruge On 20 January 2025, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 47thpresident of the United States. In Europe, uncertainty looms regarding Trump’s future approach to foreign policy and whether he might act on radical pledges regarding European security; minimise America’s role in NATO; withdraw US troops from Europe; or force Ukraine into a peace deal which includes territorial concessions to Russia and military neutrality for Ukraine. In European capitals, all eyes are on the incoming appointments for Trump’s foreign and security policy cabinet positions. The expectation is that – if the maxim 'personnel is policy' holds true – then Trump’s appointments to key cabinet positions (including the Department of State, the National Security Council, and the Pentagon) may help Europeans decipher the direction of his second foreign-policy agenda. And Trump’s second-term cabinet is likely to be more aligned with his instincts regarding European security and America’s commitment to its European allies. Identifying the Republican party’s three foreign-policy tribes (primacists, prioritisers, and restrainers) is therefore vital to interpreting his first cabinet picks; and how they may cooperate or clash in the battle for Trump’s mind. Primacists comprise the majority of the traditional Republican foreign policy elite in Congress and support continued US global leadership. They see America’s leadership in NATO and the country’s continued support for Ukraine as being in America’s strategic interest. Prioritisers and restrainers, by contrast, argue that US support for Ukraine is depleting America’s military capacity in a region which is not in America’s key strategic interest, and urge for the prioritisation of financial and military resources to the Indo-Pacific to deal with the threat from China. Restrainers especially want the US to focus on problems at home – starting with securing the country’s southern border with Mexico – and to show restraint in its deployment of military force abroad. Ultimately, both restrainers and prioritisers want Europe to take full responsibility for its own security and for Ukraine’s, allowing the US to focus on China and domestic issues. Trump’s own view is that, during his first term, a primacist-dominated cabinet sabotaged his foreign policy agenda in conjunction with the ‘deep state’. He labelledmany of his first-term advisors 'globalists and warmongers' and pledged to exclude them from his second administration – confirmed via Trump’s announcement that he will not invite Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, two prominent primacists from his first administration, to return to his second cabinet. His son, Donald Trump Jr., is a key member of Trump’s transition team: he reposted on X that the '‘stop Pompeo’ movement is great but it’s not enough' and pledged to entirely root out 'neocons and war hawks' from the next administrative line-up. But the announcement that Trump has picked Florida congressman Michael Waltz and senator Marco Rubio as national security advisor and secretary of state respectively indicates that Trump’s second-term cabinet is prepared to accept some primacists – albeit with certain adjustments. Waltz and Rubio are both former primacists turned prioritisers, and prominent ‘China hawks’ in Congress. Previously an advisor in the George W. Bush administration, Waltz is highly critical of US aid spending in Ukraine, arguing that it should end the ‘blank check’ policy and hand over responsibility for Ukraine’s defence to wealthy European nations – in particular France, Germany, and the UK. Waltz has also spoken out against Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership. Similarly, Rubio has become increasingly critical of US support for Ukraine. He sees America’s greatest task as 'forcing the outdated foreign policy blob… to reprioritise and focus on America’s most pressing threat: the Chinese Communist Party. And that will require tradeoffs and burden-sharing…'. In other words, both Waltz and Rubio have shed their previous primacist beliefs. They want to end Russia’s war in Ukraine as soon as possible, hand over responsibility for Ukraine to Europe, and shift US focus to developments in the Indo-Pacific. And the same is true for the appointment of Elise Stefanik, who Trump has appointed as his next UN ambassador. During the 2016 to 2020 term, she displayed primacist tendencies by disagreeing with Trump’s position on NATO and opposing the administration’s effort to broker an agreement with Taliban. However, Stefanik is proving herself an ardent Trump loyalist, throwing her support behind him during the Ukraine impeachment hearings in 2019 and after the Capitol insurrection on 6 January 2021. This, along with her outspoken support for Israel, has secured her a spot at the top table: given Trump’s general disdain for the UN and other international institutions, Stefanik’s role is likely to be similar to that of Haley during Trump’s first term. This mostly focused on advocacy for Israel and defence of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from international agreements and institutions. For now, it seems that prioritisers and restrainers will be steering the ship on Ukraine. This seems, chiefly, to involve opposing Ukraine’s NATO membership while heightening the expectation that Europeans should take collective responsibility for providing security guarantees to Ukraine – and support a Trump-brokered deal between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. But how Trump’s administration will approach foreign policy with regard to the Middle East is less clear cut. Unlike their views on Europe, Waltz and Rubio retain strong primacist instincts on the Middle East, especially with regard to the Israel-Iran issue. On the issue of US-supported Israeli military strikes on Iran, their views could potentially conflict with those of true prioritisers like incoming vice president, JD Vance. The latter has pledged he would not support authorising military strikes on the Iranian mainland and is keen to prevent any escalation in the region which may see a heightening of US involvement. Finally, an important dynamic will emerge between key cabinet members and the ‘corporatist’ tribe around Trump. Influential individuals such as Elon Musk, Richard Grenell, and Jared Kushner do not fall officially into any of the foreign-policy tribes. But their strong business interests in other global regions – Musk in China and Kushner in the Middle East and Arab Gulf states – mean they may not necessarily be aligned with the ideas promoted by Trump’s prioritiser members of the cabinet. There is a possibility of conflict between Musk’s business interests in China and the highly hawkish approach by prioritisers such as Waltz, Vance, or the potential next US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. Kushner’s designs for peace in the Middle East also may not align with the prioritiser or restrainer tribes, which seek to retrench from the region and avoid escalation with Iran at all costs. In contrast, however, the second-order foreign policy issues – on which prioritisers and restrainers have no opinion – will be entirely run by those, such as Grenell, who are both in charge and do have a strong opinion. Here, a prime example is the Western Balkans. There is also the possibility of the Trump wild card: he is erratic and unpredictable, and has already swung between the different foreign-policy tribes during his first term of office. But in the end, Trump’s lack of foreign policy coherence means his foreign policy advisors also have ample space through which to develop and determine America’s outreach. While the results will likely be messy and inconsistent, it is crucial that the governments of European countries braces themselves to deal with the foreign policy of a second Trump term. It will not come close to anything like his first. The European Council on Foreign Relations does not take collective positions.

Mobile Home Residents Should Be Able To Buy Their Parks – OpEd	Even in a barrelful of rotten apples, you might think there’d still be a few good ones. But don’t get your hopes up looking into barrels labeled 'private equity investors.' These esoteric, multibillion-dollar Wall Street schemes rig the marketplace so 'high-net-worth individuals' can grab fat profits and special tax breaks to buy up doctors’ offices, hometown newspapers, child care centers, etc. Consider America’s humble but beneficial mobile home parks. Homeownership has become so pricey that these affordable manufactured units now make up 10 percent of all single-family home sales. But while the buyers own the houses, they must rent lots from mobile park owners. This has generally been a square deal — at least when park owners live among the renters, providing decent services at reasonable rates. One such park is Linnhaven Center with some 300 mobile home residents in Brunswick, Maine. But these homes for millions of people have become a quick-buck target for Wall Street’s equity profiteers. Waving cash at longtime trailer park owners, private equity investors have been snatching up thousands of these lots. Without warning, people’s homes are literally being bought out from under them. The absentee predators then raise rents to drive out residents, clearing the spaces for high-dollar renters or buyers. But there’s good news for a change. A new law in Maine gives mobile home residents a chance to buy their park — and community cooperatives exist to help arrange financing. That’s what the modest-income people of Linnhaven have now done. Such a big leap isn’t easy, but give people a fair chance and they can make it work. As one Linnhaven woman put it, the community effort was much more than a property deal: It felt like 'a chance to control your own destiny.'

Moscow Prescribes Own Terms For Talks With Trump On Ukraine – Ana...	By Vladimir Socor Moscow is in no hurry to hold talks with US President-elect Donald Trump on halting Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Kremlin expects its forces to continue, slowly but steadily, seizing more Ukrainian territory, grinding down the country’s infrastructure and housing stock with air strikes, setting preconditions for a social crisis in Ukraine this coming winter, and depleting the national morale. Trump shows himself eager to substantiate his 'deal-maker' reputation by brokering a peace deal between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents even before his own presidential inauguration. From Moscow’s perspective, however, holding such talks at this time could stymie its military operations in Ukraine before they attained their objectives. It would be entirely out of character with the Kremlin to enter negotiations with a major foreign leader who has not yet taken office. Moscow will, however, be ready to engage with Trump following his January 20 inauguration. By then, Russia also expects its military position to have grown stronger in Ukraine. The Kremlin could then turn Trump’s manifest eagerness for a deal into leverage against the US president. Awaiting that moment, Moscow is prescribing its own terms for possible talks with Trump on Ukraine. Within two days of Trump’s November 5 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin used a high-profile Valdai Club event to announce his willingness to hold talks with Trump on Ukraine when certain conditions are met. Putin listed those conditions but not before paying his respects to Trump’s 'courageous, manly reaction to the assassination attempt against him. The man proved himself, showed his character in that extraordinary situation.' Congratulating Trump on his election, Putin professed to be 'more than ready' to hold talks with Trump and 'open to restoring relations with the United States,' but he would not initiate a telephone call to the US president. 'The ball is in the US court' (Kremlin.ru, November 7). Follow-up statements by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov (Interfax, November 9) and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (TASS, November 13; Mid.ru, November 14) elaborated on Putin’s list of conditions for Russia-US high-level talks on ending the war in Ukraine. The conditions are familiar for the most part. They refer to prerequisites, processes, and outcomes, including: Talks can only commence once Russia regains the entire territory of its Kursk oblast. The United States should initiate talks with Russia. No quick fixes. 'His [Trump’s] signals about a super-quick settlement are nothing but election campaign rhetoric' (Ryabkov). 'The subject matter of talks cannot be merely a ceasefire, but a solution that would lead to restoring cooperation between these two peoples that are indisputably fraternal despite these tragic events' (Putin). Peace talks must at first involve Russia and Ukraine bilaterally. They must proceed from the 'Istanbul documents,' tentatively drafted by Moscow and Kyiv in March-April 2022 and based on Putin’s own June 14, list of demands to Ukraine (see EDM, March 17, 30, 31, April 4, 5, 2022, May 29, 30, June 20). Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy must rescind his October 2022 decree banning direct political negotiations with the Kremlin (see EDM, October 5, 2022). 'Russia will certainly consider and answer Trump’s and any US proposals if geared to a political settlement, but not geared to supporting the Kyiv regime and feeding its expectations' (Lavrov). 'Western countries … should abruptly [rezko] cut the volume of their support to Kyiv, including military support, and get [their] Kyiv clients to abandon the idea that they could achieve anything without a direct dialogue with Moscow. This is what the US-led West must focus on during Trump’s presidential term' (Lavrov). 'Ukraine’s post-war borders must reflect the sovereign decisions of the people who live on the lands that we name our historic lands' [alluding to the four Russian-annexed provinces on the Ukrainian mainland] (Putin). The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had opened its door to Ukraine aiming to 'appropriate our [Russia’s] historical territories.' Post-war good-neighborly relations between Russia and Ukraine would only be possible if Ukraine is a permanently neutral country. 'The European Union has practically turned into the same thing as NATO in a military-political sense … NATO and the European Union will arrange some division of labor between them (Lavrov)—a warning that Russia could deem Ukraine’s candidacy to EU membership as incompatible with neutrality. These terms and parameters are not new, nor is their listing complete. They are presented with fresh emphases to familiarize Trump’s incoming team with them, ahead of possible direct contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government. These statements concern putative negotiations on a bilateral basis between Moscow and Kyiv but stop short of referring to follow-up negotiations in a multilateral format regarding post-war security guarantees to Ukraine. This multilateral track became the proximate cause for the collapse of the 2022 'Istanbul' negotiations because Russia was included among the would-be security guarantors of a neutral Ukraine. If Russia insists on being included in the multilateral format again, the negotiations are bound to collapse.

South Korea Best Off Balancing Deterrence And Diplomacy With The ...	By Rachel Minyoung Lee Unification is a perennial topic of interest among Korea watchers, but it has been particularly popular — and confusing — in recent months, with North and South Korea each sending diametrically opposed signals. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol delivered a rare speech dedicated to unification on Liberation Day, 15 August 2024, reaffirming Seoul’s commitment to unification and even telling Pyongyang that South Korea would ‘keep the door to inter-Korean dialogue wide open’. This was despite Kim Jong-un’s announcement at the end of 2023 of a new two Koreas policy, which defined North and South Korea as ‘two belligerent states’ and discarded the decades-long policy of peaceful unification. There was much speculation following the October 7–8 session of the North Korean parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, about whether the assembly had indeed revised the constitution to remove unification-related language and define North Korean territory according to Kim’s instructions in early 2024. Pyongyang subsequently implied that it made at least one revision related to inter-Korean issues — defining South Korea as ‘a hostile state’ — but it remains unknown whether it made other related amendments. North Korea never responded to Yoon’s Liberation Day speech, indicating a lack of interest in improving relations with Seoul. To the contrary, Kim himself reacted quickly to Yoon’s Armed Forces Day parade speech on 1 October 2024, even leveling an unusually direct nuclear threat that the North would ‘use without hesitation all the striking forces in its possession, including nuclear weapons’, against South Korea if its sovereignty was violated. Dialogue with North Korea — however desirable and necessary — is unrealistic for the foreseeable future. This raises the question of what is the best way forward. Kim’s two Koreas policy is here to stay. It is a result of a fundamental policy reorientation that occurred over a period of more than four years, going back to the breakdown of the Trump-Kim Hanoi summit in 2019. Kim’s call for the development of tactical nuclear weapons and the revised nuclear law, which implicitly expanded the scope of nuclear strike targets to South Korea, were just two of multiple indicators. Pyongyang’s South Korea policy change should be viewed within the broader context of its foreign policy reorientation. North Korea has given up its three decade-long policy of normalisation of ties with the United States through denuclearisation — distinct from a lack of appetite for normalisation of relations altogether — and, by natural extension, its policy of nonalignment with China and Russia. Kim’s decisions seem to increasingly be driven by the opportunities he sees in great power competition and the shifting geopolitical landscape, giving him even less motivation to improve relations with South Korea. Pyongyang’s policy towards the United States was almost certainly affected by what it perceived to be waning US leadership on the global stage due to US–China competition and a ‘multipolar’ global order. North Korea’s relations with Russia have reached new heights since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, as evidenced by their new bilateral treaty. We should note that Kim announced the new South Korea policy in the midst of his ever-blossoming relations with Putin. This relationship probably emboldened Kim to trash the concept of unification, his forefathers’ legacy and one that has been deeply ingrained in the North Korean people’s minds. For as long as the current circumstances persist, the most realistic way for South Korea to manage relations with the North — and the potential for US–China competition and deepening Pyongyang–Moscow relations to amplify North Korea’s growing nuclear threats — is to balance deterrence with clearer signals for dialogue. Priority should be given to strengthening deterrence. In that vein, South Korea should continue to make efforts to advance its weapons systems. Seoul should continue to strengthen its alliance with the United States and work with it to maintain the credibility of extended deterrence. It should also step up trilateral security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo. It is important to remember that muscle-building in and of itself cannot be the goal of deterrence — the goal is to maintain peace and lay the groundwork for future diplomacy. Accordingly, Seoul should redouble its efforts to signal to North Korea that its interest in dialogue is genuine. The first step to doing this is for Seoul to tone down on the themes that Pyongyang finds hostile — such as North Korean human rights and right of access to information — in its public messages specifically targeting North Korea. It is important for South Korea to continue to take the lead in working on these issues with the international community. But these themes do not have to be emphasised in messages that are intended to resonate with North Korea. Seoul should also learn from the lessons of the past that North Korea will not trade its nuclear weapons for economic compensation. The Lee Myung-bak administration’s Vision 3000: Denuclearisation and Openness and Yoon’s ‘Audacious Initiative’, both of which sought to incentivise North Korea to denuclearise through economic compensation, failed. It is time to recognise that North Korea’s strategic interests have changed, understand the reasons for this shift and craft viable policy options that work for both sides. Striking the right balance between deterrence and dialogue is not an easy task. But if Seoul can bring itself to be a little more flexible, it may be in a better position to deal with North Korea when the country is ready to start engaging. The time for diplomacy may arrive after January 2026, when North Korea is expected to hold its next quinquennial Party Congress and review and recalibrate its domestic and foreign policy.

Viewing A Fragmented America Through The Lens Of Economic Data – ...	By Muren Jin In recent times, U.S. economic data has become a target of criticism, with the degree of division caused by it being no less intense than the polarization between the two major parties during U.S. elections. This division is evident across multiple aspects, an indication of the fragmentation of the American economy at various levels. First, there is a clear split between different data points at the same time, particularly in the Markit Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI. According to data released by S&P Global on October 24, due to strong demand in the services sector, U.S. business activity maintained steady growth for most of October, with expectations of a rebound to the highest point in over two years. However, manufacturing has contracted for the third consecutive month, although the pace of contraction has slightly slowed. The preliminary October Markit Manufacturing PMI for the U.S. stood at 47.8, slightly higher than the expected 47.5 and the previous 47.3. Meanwhile, the preliminary October Markit Services PMI was 55.3, surpassing the expected 55 and the previous 55.2. Whether examining recent short-term data or the long-term decline of the Rust Belt since World War II, it is clear that the concept of a 'financially-driven nation' has become more deeply entrenched in the U.S. This suggests a widening industrial divide, pointing to an underlying imbalance in the American economy. Second, the same data, presented at different times, shows a clear divide, particularly evident in the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI's 'wild swings' around the dividing line of expansion and contraction. On November 5, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released data showing that the U.S. ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI for October was 56, the highest in nearly two years, well above the expected 53.8 and the previous September value of 54.9. A PMI above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 signals contraction. The October reading significantly exceeded expectations, surpassing the forecasts of nearly all economists surveyed. However, it is important to note that since the second quarter of this year, the U.S. Non-Manufacturing PMI has been quite volatile. In April and June, the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI fell into contraction, while the data for September and October showed a noticeable improvement. The ups and downs of non-manufacturing data correspond with the Federal Reserve's major shift from maintaining a tightening cycle to initiating a loosening cycle with interest rate cuts. The data fluctuations have cleverly paved the way for rate cuts and later helped support the economic soft landing. On October 25, former Fed Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh openly stated in an interview with CNBC that the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September was at odds with its previous policy statements. Warsh raised concerns, 'I do not want to be the person accusing them of politics. That’s not the central bank I know. But when you don’t have a theory and follow it, it’s easy to get that accusation'. Third, the same data type, presented by different institutions at the same time, shows a stark divide, particularly evident in the significant discrepancy in 'non-farm payroll' data. On October 30, the ADP employment report showed that in October, U.S. companies hired at the fastest pace in over a year, indicating an extraordinary demand for labor. According to the latest data from ADP, U.S. private sector employment grew by 233,000 in October, far surpassing expectations. Additionally, the September ADP employment figure was revised upward from 143,000 to 159,000. The latest ADP data exceeded the forecasts of all economists surveyed by Bloomberg and was significantly higher than the 114,000 jobs expected by most economists. In contrast, on November 1, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data showing that non-farm payrolls in October had plummeted to just 12,000, a sharp decline from September's 254,000 (revised down to 223,000), marking the lowest increase since 2020, and well below the expected 106,000. While Fed 'voting member' Christopher Waller and President Joe Biden's chief economic advisor, Lael Brainard, both indicated that this report likely reflected temporary job losses due to recent hurricanes and the Boeing strike, the BLS acknowledged in its statement that while hurricanes may have affected employment in certain sectors, the impact on overall U.S. employment, hours worked, or income could not be quantified. The BLS also stated that the hurricanes had no significant effect on the overall national unemployment rate. The stark discrepancy in important data, combined with conflicting views from data release agencies, the Fed, and government officials, highlights the significant differences in perspectives on the state of the U.S. economy. Fourth, there is a divergence between history and reality, specifically reflected in the triggering of the Sahm Rule and the deviation of U.S. GDP growth. On August 2, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the U.S. unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.3% in July, the highest level since October 2021, and higher than the expected 4.1%. The increase in the unemployment rate triggered the well-known recession indicator, the Sahm Rule. Notably, historically, the Sahm Rule has been confirmed in all 11 U.S. economic recessions since 1950, without exception. However, data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on October 30 showed that the U.S. GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter, a slowdown of 0.2 percentage points from the second quarter, and below the economists' expectation of 3.1%. Still, the growth was better than most other developed economies during the same period. Economists also pointed out that while the growth rate slightly slowed compared to the second quarter, it remains relatively strong compared to historical trends. The differing perspectives between historical experience and current realities regarding economic development continue to resonate in the ongoing heated debate about whether the U.S. economy is headed for a soft landing. Fifth, there is a divergence between data and personal experience, specifically reflected in the contrast between the decline in inflation data and the harsh inflationary pressures felt by ordinary people. On October 30, data released by the BEA showed that the Fed's preferred inflation indicator, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 2.2% on an annualized quarter-over-quarter basis in the third quarter. This was slightly higher than the market expectation of 2.1%, but 0.6 percentage points lower than the second quarter. Subsequently, on October 31, data from the BEA revealed that the U.S. PCE price index for September rose 2.1% year-over-year, in line with expectations, marking the lowest level since early 2021. In contrast, starting in mid-September, U.S. dollar stores like Dollar General and Dollar Tree began to lower their sales forecasts and warned that their core consumers were under pressure, which caused their stock prices to drop sharply. Dollar stores, known for their low-cost, limited-product, and low-price business model, originally priced all items at a dollar and have long been a source of food and basic goods for low-income Americans. The sales performance of these dollar stores provides a clear indication of the real state of U.S. inflation and its impact on the consumption spending of middle- and low-income groups. The decline in cold, hard inflation data sharply contrasts with the dire economic realities faced by ordinary citizens. As ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan put it, the current U.S. inflation data is unreliable; the base effect of the data masks the deeper underlying significance beneath the surface. Overall, in recent times, the fragmentation of U.S. economic data reveals a deepening of the current multi-dimensional and multi-level divisions within the United States. Kung Chan has pointed out more profoundly that the objectivity and representativeness of U.S. data are now highly questionable. In the future, the use of U.S. data must be approached with caution, as the importance and necessity of understanding data have reached a very high level, making it almost inadvisable to use such data directly. Final analysis conclusion: In recent times, the fragmentation of American economic data reveals a deepening of the current multi-dimensional and multi-layered divisions within the United States. At the same time, there are significant doubts about the objectivity and representativeness of U.S. data. The importance and necessity of understanding data have reached a very high level, which means that the use of U.S. data must be approached with caution.

Has Anyone Noticed What BRICS+ Is Telling Us About A New World Or...	By Jean-Daniel Ruch In the beginning, there were four: Brazil, China, India and Russia. Following their first summit in 2009, they expanded to become BRICS with the accession of South Africa in 2011 and then nine in January 2024. At the sixteenth BRICS summit this October in Kazan, Russia, two African countries, Egypt and Ethiopia, and two Middle Eastern countries, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, made up what people now refer to as BRICS+. Thirteen among the more than thirty countries that have formally expressed their interest in membership are now associated with BRICS+: four Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam), two Latin American countries (Cuba and Bolivia), three African countries (Algeria, Nigeria, Uganda), two Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) and two European countries (Belarus and NATO member Turkey). They were given the status of 'partner states' in Kazan. To say that the Americans are not enthusiastic about the appeal of this new global club would be an understatement. Should the success of the summit in Kazan be interpreted as a sign of the failure of their strategy to isolate Russia? Worse still, are we witnessing the beginning of the end of the American century? In addition to the nine member states and thirteen partners, the summit was also attended by some representatives of countries whose presence was rather unexpected, such as the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister, the very Russophilic Alexander Vulin. However, it was the presence of UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutierres that caused outraged reactions, especially in Ukraine. 'The UN Secretary-General declined Ukraine’s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland. However, he has accepted the invitation of the war criminal Putin to Kazan,' hammered the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. It is true that Gutierres boycotted the Bürgenstock meeting this spring. It is also legitimate to wonder whether a UN Secretary-General should shake hands with a person accused of war crimes, even if he is the president of a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin on March 17, 2023. This juicy skewer of participants is notable for its heterogeneity. There are dictatorships and democracies, Muslim, Christian and secular countries, economic superpowers and failed nations, some have characterized as rogue states. Are what we are witnessing merely an updated reiteration of that elastic non-aligned movement launched in the 1960s by Yugoslavia’s Prime Minister Josip Tito and Indian Jawaharlal Nehru, which encompassed two-thirds of the world but never achieved any real global influence? No, something else is happening here. In the space of sixty years, the balance of global power has clearly changed. A motley but (almost) global group with growing influence Antonio Gutierres is a realist. He understands how historically significant the bubbling events within the BRICS states are. He was in Kazan because it is important. To underline that point, consider a few figures. The nine countries now called BRICS+ account for more than half of the world’s population. Their combined gross national product is already greater than that of their rivals in the G7, the Western directorate comprising the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the UK. The gap is likely to widen in the coming years, since the BRICS+ growth rate is around 5%, while Western economies are stagnating at 1–2% — and some, like Germany’s, are officially in a recession. Despite these new geo-economic realities, the international order established by the West after the World War II has been resistant to change. The UN Security Council will remain secure in the hands of its five permanent members — three Western states plus China and Russia — for a long time to come. However, the BRICS states are not seeking to change the United Nations Charter or create a parallel system to the United Nations. Rather, they are focusing on the economic and financial governance of the world. Parallel to the founding of the United Nations, the victorious Western powers, at the Bretton Woods conference in 1945, created institutions designed to regulate world finance. The dollar became the world’s reserve currency, making every country vulnerable to US sanctions. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which provide financial assistance to countries in difficulty, are run like shareholder meetings, in which the US holds a decisive vote. Together with the other Western nations, they possess an absolute majority. It is these two pillars of Western power in the world that the BRICS states hope to compete with. But how? It would be literally impossible to reform the international financial institutions in such a way as to reduce Western influence in them. However, they cannot prevent the creation of parallel systems of payment. The BRICS countries are thus working on three main tasks: A mechanism for processing international payments independent of SWIFT — from which Russia was excluded after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. An intensification of trade that is invoiced in local currencies instead of dollars, in order to accelerate the 'de-dollarization of the world.' A development bank that competes with the World Bank and finances infrastructure projects. There are currently 96 projects underway with a total volume of $32 billion. Critics of the BRICS states doubt that they are able to really compete with the dollar. Despite a steady erosion, the greenback still accounts for 55% of the reserves of the national banks. And when it is replaced by other currencies, these tend to be Western currencies, with the notable exception of the Chinese renminbi. Nevertheless, the trend is clear and the potential of BRICS+ is there. The formation of alternative transportation corridors is part of the same strategy to break free from Western, i.e., American dependency. Land routes vs. sea routes In a globalized and interdependent world, the transport of goods represents a strategic dimension. From cars to cell phones, hardly any industrial activity exists that does not include and depend on an accumulation of natural resources and semi-finished products from all corners of the world. Over the last hundred years, goods have primarily been transported by sea. Today, sea freight accounts for 70% of world trade. You only have to look at a map of the 128 US naval bases around the world to realize how important the sea lanes are to Washington’s power strategy. From the Sea of Japan to Malacca, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Panama, Rotterdam and New York, Washington’s ambition — sometimes supported by its British ally — to dominate the seas is obvious. With its 'Belt and Road' initiative, China has been trying for several years to develop land routes to, compete or at least complement the existing sea routes. It is therefore very revealing that one of the flagship projects highlighted in Kazan was the North–South Corridor, which will ultimately connect St. Petersburg with India, without passing through any Western-controlled areas. Is it worth remembering that India has become the largest importer of Russian oil products, despite the very audible gnashing of teeth in Washington? What is Switzerland doing? Between soft power and economic impact, the BRICS+ are redrawing the geopolitical map. Is Switzerland even aware of this probably irreversible development? Has it sought an invitation to Kazan? The answer is yes, Swiss companies are well aware of the underlying forces shaping the world of tomorrow. This is why some, for example in the trade sector, are moving to Dubai. Yes, Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs is well aware of this. It wants to update our free trade agreement with China. Switzerland is the only European country apart from Iceland to have concluded such an agreement. That is an advantage. Unfortunately, the options chosen by the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport have not been helpful. By running after the Americans, who have been losing all their wars for twenty years, weFO° Exclusive: Make Sense of BRICS Summit in Russiahave turned Russia against us and made China doubt our reliability. Moreover, for three quarters of the world Gaza has become a symbol of the moral bankruptcy of the West, including Switzerland. Is there still time to restore our credibility?

Medicare Advantage Is Saving Taxpayers Money – OpEd	A new study finds that the migration of people from traditional Medicare to the Medicare Advantage program over the last decade has saved the federal government $144 billion. The study arrives at a time when critics have stepped up their claims that Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are over-billing Medicare and causing a waste of taxpayer money. The study was conducted by Elevance, a private insurer with an obvious financial interest in the topic. However, the researchers make their data sources apparent and their results are available for scrutiny by others. The Elevance study builds on a finding by other, more limited investigations: What happens in the MA system indirectly affects what happens to patients in traditional Medicare. In a typical MA plan, doctors are encouraged to practice integrated, coordinated care—sharing medical records and following agreed-upon treatment plans, for example. This results in more efficient care. Yet these very same doctors also treat traditional Medicare patients. So, methods they employ to practice cost-effective care for one set of patients are more likely to be repeated in the treatment of other patients. Other studies have found that where there is a large presence of MA patients in an area, there tend to be spillover effects. Protocols used by MA plans tend to be become more widespread—affecting all Medicare patients. The Elevance study measures this effect nationwide. It is a first-time comparison of spending on MA patients and traditional Medicare patients in the same counties, across the entire country. The finding: larger enrollment in MA plans leads to lower spending on all Medicare patients. Specifically, a 10% increase in market share by MA plans leads to an average decrease in spending on all Medicare beneficiaries of between $105 and $127 per person, per year. Savings for Seniors More than half of all seniors in Medicare get their health insurance from a private MA plan. Because these plans typically provide comprehensive coverage, enrollees avoid paying for 'medigap' insurance that other seniors acquire to plug the holes in traditional Medicare. That’s one reason why the average senior in an MA plan is saving $2,541 a year in out-of-pocket costs. Participants also get extra benefits that traditional Medicare enrollees don’t get, including dental, eye, and hearing care. Since the program was originally a bipartisan creation, you would think that politicians in both parties would openly brag about the program and claim credit for it. Yet in recent years, many on the left have become increasingly hostile. The Biden administration has slashed payments to MA plans over the past two years, causing some MA plans to leave the market altogether and others to reduce the benefits they offer. The administration has also been a ruthless regulator. Based on a 'secret shopper' report, the administration fined one company $190 million for falling to answer a phone call in less than 8 seconds! Are MA plans overpaid? The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) claims that MA plans are paid 20% more than Medicare pays for patients with similar health conditions in traditional Medicare. They admit that MA patients get more benefits than regular Medicare patients But, they argue that giving MA enrollees benefits that traditional Medicare enrollees don’t get is not a good use of taxpayer money. One problem with MedPAC’s analysis is that traditional Medicare enrollees are not a homogeneous population. Some are also in employer plans. Some are also in Medicaid. They have different levels of out-of-pocket exposure. In failing to thoroughly adjust for these differences, MedPAC did not make a true apples-to-apples comparison between Medicare spending on enrollees in traditional Medicare and on MA enrollees. A more rigorous study by Milliman corrected for these problems and found that the government saves money when people leave traditional Medicare and enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. The savings equal $576 per enrollee per year. This is consistent with the Elevance results, independent of spillover effects. Upcoding One reason why the Medicare Advantage program works so much better than the (Obamacare) exchange is individualized risk adjustment. That means that MA plans get paid based on the health condition of their enrollees. If a patient is very sick, the government will pay the plan more. These payments are designed to make the healthy and the sick equally attractive to an insurer. As a result, MA plans have a financial incentive to find and report every health condition that generates a more generous payment from Medicare. 'Upcoding' occurs when the plans report conditions that might not be reported by doctors practicing in traditional Medicare. Critics claim that MA companies are overly zealous—perhaps even reporting phantom conditions. This is one of the suspicions behind the claim that MA plans are overpaid. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal (in collaboration with Medicare) found that in a single year, Medicare paid insurers $50 billion for diseases no doctor ever treated. However, doctors and hospitals treating traditional Medicare patients also have a financial incentive to overbill Medicare. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there are a higher percent of coding errors in traditional Medicare and they cost taxpayers twice as much money ($31.2 billion versus $16.6 billion in 2023). Efficiency The Better Medicare Alliance (an industry-funded organization), reports that MA plans deliver 13% lower inpatient hospitalization costs, 49% lower acute care hospital stays, and a 43% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations. This is despite the fact that MA enrollees have lower incomes, less education and are more likely to be from a minority population. The comparison is even better for people enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid—thought to be the most vulnerable population. Among this group, being in an MA plan means a 14.2% lower likelihood of a hospital stay, a 72.6% higher likelihood of receiving a colorectal cancer screening, and a 52.5% higher likelihood of having a breast cancer screening. The Medicare Advantage program has shown that competition in the marketplace is superior to government-run health insurance—in raising quality and lowering costs.

‘NAFTA Fever’ And The Myth Of Government-Created Free Markets – O...	By David Brady, Jr. Left or right, the enemy is the free market. Every problem is the fault of the free market. On the left, the supposed radical deregulation of the 1980s paved the way for the financial crisis and the destruction of the environment. On the right, free trade is responsible for the gutting of manufacturing. The free market is made out in this mythos to have had its heyday in the 1980s and ‘90s and destroyed everything. Even free market advocates fall into this trap, saying that this time in the near past was a free market victory. The results—they try to argue with the market critics, but they agree with the causal analysis: Markets won! Hooray!The fact is that all three of these groups are wrong. There was no American market revolution in the ‘80s. It is important to make note of the rhetoric of American life up until the 1980s. American life at the beginning of the 1930s was introduced to the message of 'market failures' that justified the New Deal. By the end of the 1940s, Americans were thrown into the Cold War, where all of American life was defined by a battle between 'American Capitalism' and 'Soviet Communism.' Paying lip service to the free market was easy. Fusionism became the default conservative ideology, the mixture of so-called 'fiscal conservatism,' the 'moral majority,' and hawkish foreign policy. The hawkish foreign policy—the boogeyman of National Review—was bearing the brunt of the load. As Buckley put it: We have got to accept Big Government for the duration [of the Cold War]— for neither an offensive nor a defensive war can be waged…except through the instrumentality of a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores. 'Fiscal conservatism' was cast aside in the name of fighting the Soviet menace, but it was in the name of capitalism because everything was done in the name of fighting communism. Every American who bought into the existential crisis of Cold War rhetoric could be coaxed into supporting any policy in the name of capitalism and free trade. So when politicians wheeled forward thousand-page treaties with import/export quotas, environmental regulations, and currency price controls under the name of 'Free Trade Agreements.' No wonder the American people got behind it. No wonder free trade got stuck with the blame. It is an age-old tactic to give bills positive names while they have the opposite effect (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act). Who would oppose the 'Giving Puppies Good Homes Bill of 2024'? At the end of the Cold War, who would oppose a supposed free trade agreement with our fellow capitalist allies? With the backing of the tail-end of the Cold War market-rhetoric and every Cold War 'free enterprise' think tank, we were given NAFTA. Rothbard himself lamented the rise of NAFTA fervor in every so-called 'free market think tank.' He wrote in his essay 'The NAFTA Myth': For some people, it seems, all you have to do to convince them of the free enterprise nature of something is to label it 'market,' and so we have the spawning of such grotesque creatures as 'market socialists' or 'market liberals.' The word 'freedom,' of course, is also a grabber, and so another way to gain adherents in an age that exalts rhetoric over substance is simply to call yourself or your proposal 'free market' or 'free trade.' Labels are often enough to nab the suckers. And so, among champions of free trade, the label 'North American Free Trade Agreement' (Nafta) is supposed to command unquestioning assent. 'But how can you be against free trade?' It’s very easy. The folks who have brought us Nafta and presume to call it 'free trade' are the same people who call government spending 'investment,' taxes 'contributions,' and raising taxes 'deficit reduction.' Let us not forget that the Communists, too, used to call their system 'freedom.' One has to wonder where NAFTA supporters found their solace: Was it ignorance of what was actually in the treaty? Was it in favor of some 'middle-of-the-road' policy? Or was it by virtue of being purchased and funded by vested business interests that benefited from the treaty? We may never quite know. But we can know for certainty that a treatise with thousands of pages, featuring currency controls, import controls, and imposed cross-border regulations is hardly a laissez-faire victory. But these rhetorical victories that Rothbard decries become stuck in the minds of Americans. The media proclaims the 'new age of free trade!' and most buy into it. The failures of interventionism are thus blamed on the free market. Reagan is lauded as a limited government president who unleashed the markets through deregulation but that is truly a myth. Reagan may have allowed his bureaucracies to loosen environmental regulations in his tenure but it opened the door for the dreaded Chevron Doctrine. Reagan did not touch the New Deal and Great Society apparatus of regulation. The bureaucracies of the Progressive Era remained intact. The central bank remained. Reagan may have lowered some income tax rates, but he was hardly a deregulator. Lest any progressive try to blame so-called 'financial deregulation' for the 'Dotcom' and 2008 recessions, the only needed response is Tom Woods’ book Meltdown. Central banks playing price controls with interest rates created the financial crises. Thus, we reach the two-fold path of 'NAFTA fever.' It comes in two forms: either the radical insistence on a free market victory that never truly happened or the hatred of the free market based off of a rhetorical scheme that never was true. Neither are honest or helpful. Those defending markets should not fall into NAFTA fever, into a dogmatic orthodoxy whereby they defend NAFTA and the illusion of a free market victory. These were never free market victories, but intervention dressed in the garb of market rhetoric. We should not be jumping to the defense of the results of interventionism. Interventionism causes a death spiral of failure and continually worse social conditions. To bring about free markets and a more prosperous society, we need to make it clear what is the fault of interventionism and what isn’t. The United States has been defined by interventionist economic policy for a century, so it is no wonder that social conditions have worsened and more have become discontent. Free markets didn’t cause our conditions, they were simply the costume in which interventionism was packaged.No wonder more people today despise markets. By buying into the rhetorical marketplace of the time interventionists and cronies passed off their interventionist legislation as part of a 'market revolution.' The revolution never came, unlike the revolution described by Garet Garrett. American political discourse needs a cure to its NAFTA fever.

There Are No ‘Easy Wars’ Left To Fight, But Do Not Mistake The Lo...	Israelis, as a whole, are exhibiting a rosy assurance that they can harness Trump, if not to the full annexation of the Occupied Territories (Trump in his first term did not support such annexation), but rather, to ensnare him into a war on Iran. Many (even most) Israelis are raring for war on Iran and an aggrandisement of their territory (devoid of Arabs). They are believing the puffery that Iran ‘lies naked’, staggeringly vulnerable, before a U.S. and Israeli military strike. Trump’s Team nominations, so far, reveal a foreign policy squad of fierce supporters of Israel and of passionate hostility to Iran. The Israeli media term it a ‘dream team’ for Netanyahu. It certainly looks that way. The Israel Lobby could not have asked for more. They have got it. And with the new CIA chief, they get a known ultra China hawk as a bonus. But in the domestic sphere the tone is precisely the converse: The key nomination for ‘cleaning the stables’ is Matt Gaetz as Attorney General; he is a real 'bomb thrower'. And for the Intelligence clean-up, Tulsi Gabbard is appointed as Director of National Intelligence. All intelligence agencies will report to her, and she will be responsible for the President’s Daily briefing. The intel assessments may thus begin to reflect something closer to reality. The deep Inter-Agency structure has reason to be very afraid; they are panicking – especially over Gaetz. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have the near impossible task of cutting out-of-control federal spending and currency printing. The System is deeply dependent on the bloat of government spending to keep the cogs and levers of the mammoth ‘security’ boondoggle whirring. It is not going to be yielded up without a bitter fight. So, on the one hand, the Lobby gets a dream team (Israel), but on the other side (the domestic sphere), it gets a renegade team. This must be deliberate. Trump knows that Biden’s legacy of bloating GDP with government jobs and excessive public spending is the real ‘time bomb’ awaiting him. Again the withdrawal symptoms, as the drug of easy money is withdrawn, may prove incendiary. Moving to a structure of tariffs and low taxes will be disruptive. Whether deliberate or not, Trump is keeping his cards close to his chest. We have only glimpses of intent – and the water is being seriously muddied by the infamous ‘Inter-Agency’ grandees. For example, in respect to the Pentagon sanctioning private-sector contractors to work in Ukraine, this was done in coordination with 'inter-agency stakeholders'. The old nemesis that paralysed his first term again faces Trump. Then, during the Ukraine impeachment process, one witness (Vindman), when asked why he would not defer to the President’s explicit instructions, replied that whilst Trump has his view on Ukraine policy, that stance did NOT align with that of the ‘Inter-Agency’ agreed position. In plain language, Vindman denied that a U.S. president has agency in foreign policy formulation. In short, the ‘Inter-Agency structure’ was signalling to Trump that military support for Ukraine must continue. When the Washington Post published their detailed story of a Trump-Putin phone call – that the Kremlin emphatically states never happened – the deep structures of policy were simply telling Trump that it would be they who determine what the shape of the U.S. ‘solution’ for Ukraine would be. Similarly, when Netanyahu boasts to have spoken to Trump and that Trump 'shares' his views regarding Iran, Trump was being indirectly instructed what his policy towards Iran needs to be. All the (false) rumours about appointments to his Team too, were but the interagency signalling their choices for his key posts. No wonder confusion reigns. So, what can be deduced at this early stage? If there is a common thread, it has been a constant refrain that Trump is against war. And that he demands from his picks personal loyalty and no ties of obligation to the Lobby or the Swamp. So, is the packing of his Administration with ‘Israel Firsters’ an indication that Trump is edging toward a ‘Realist’s Faustian pact’ to destroy Iran in order to cripple China’s energy supply source (90% from Iran), and thus weaken China? – Two birds with one stone, so to speak? The collapse of Iran would also weaken Russia and hobble the BRICS’ transport-corridor projects. Central Asia needs both Iranian energy and its key transport corridors linking China, Iran, and Russia as primary nodes of Eurasian commerce. When the RAND Organisation, the Pentagon think-tank, recently published a landmark appraisal of the 2022 National Defence Strategy (NDS), its findings were stark: An unrelentingly bleak analysis of every aspect of the U.S. war machine. In brief, the U.S. is 'not prepared', the appraisal argued, in any meaningful way for serious ‘competition’ with its major adversaries – and is vulnerable or even significantly outmatched in every sphere of warfare. The U.S., the RAND appraisal continues, could in short order be drawn into a war across multiple theatres with peer and near-peer adversaries – and it could lose. It warns that the U.S. public has not internalized the costs of the U.S. losing its position as the world superpower. The U.S. must therefore engage globally with a presence—military, diplomatic, and economic—to preserve influence worldwide. Indeed, as one respected commentator has noted, the ‘Empire at all Costs’ cult (i.e. the RAND Organisation zeitgeist) is now 'more desperate than ever to find a war it can fight to restore its fortunes and prestige'. And China would be altogether a different proposition for a demonstrative act of destruction in order 'to preserve U.S. influence worldwide' – for the U.S. is 'not prepared' for serious conflict with its peer adversaries: Russia or China, RAND says. The straitened situation of the U.S. after decades of fiscal excess and offshoring (the backdrop to its current weakened military industrial base) now makes kinetic war with China or Russia or 'across multiple theatres' a prospect to be shunned. The point that the commentator above makes is that there are no ‘easy wars’ left to fight. And that the reality (brutally outlined by RAND) is that the U.S. can choose one – and only one war to fight. Trump may not want any war, but the Lobby grandees – all supporters of Israel, if not active Zionists supporting the displacement of Palestinians – want war. And they believe they can get one. Put starkly and plainly: Has Trump thought this through? Have the others in the Trump Team reminded him that in today’s world, with U.S. military strength slipping away, there no longer are any ‘easy wars’ to fight, although Zionists believe that with a decapitation strike on Iran’s religious and IRGC leadership (on the lines of the Israel’s strikes on Hizbullah leaders in Beirut), the Iranian people would rise up against their leaders, and side with Israel for a ‘New Middle East’. Netanyahu has just made his second broadcast to the Iranian people promising them early salvation. He and his government are not waiting to ask Trump to nod his consent to the annexation of all Occupied Palestinian Territories. That project is being implemented on the ground. It is unfolding now. Netanyahu and his cabinet have the ethnic cleansing ‘bit between their teeth’. Will Trump be able to roll it back? How so? Or will he succumb to becoming ‘genocide Don’? This putative ‘Iran War’ is following the same narrative cycle as with Russia: ‘Russia is weak; its military is poorly trained; its equipment mostly recycled from the Soviet era; its missiles and artillery in short supply’. Zbig Brzezinski earlier had taken the logic to its conclusion in The Grand Chessboard (1997): Russia would have no choice but to submit to the expansion of NATO and to the geopolitical dictates of the U.S.. That was ‘then’ (a little more than a year ago). Russia took the western challenge – and today is in the driving seat in Ukraine, whilst the West looks on helplessly. This last month, it was U.S. retired General Jack Keane, the strategic analyst for Fox News, who argued that Israel’s air strike on Iran had left it 'essentially naked', with most air defences 'taken down' and its missile production factories destroyed by Israel’s 26 October strikes. Iran’s vulnerability, Keane said, is 'simply staggering'. Kean channels the early Brzezinski: His message is clear – Iran will be an ‘easy war’. That forecast however, is likely to be revealed as dead wrong. And, if pursued, will lead to a complete military and economic disaster for Israel. But do not rule out the distinct possibility that Netanyahu – besieged on all fronts and teetering on the brink of internal crisis and even jail – is desperate enough to do it. His is, after all, a Biblical mandate that he pursues for Israel! Iran likely will launch a painful response to Israel before the 20 January Presidential Inauguration. Its riposte will demonstrate Iran’s unexpected and unforeseen military innovation. What the U.S. and Israel will then do may well open the door to wider regional war. Sentiment across the region seethes at the slaughter in the Occupied Territories and in Lebanon. Trump may not appreciate just how isolated the U.S. and Israel are among Israel’s Arab and Sunni neighbours. The U.S. is stretched so thin, and its forces across the region are so vulnerable to the hostility that the daily slaughter incubates, that a regional war might be enough to bring the entire house of cards tumbling down. The crisis would pitch Trump into a financial crisis that could sink his domestic economic aspirations too.

Robert Reich: There Was No Mandate For Trump, There Was No Red Sh...	Trump is saying the election gave him a 'very big mandate.' Rubbish. It wasn’t a mandate at all. It wasn’t even a 'red shift' to Trump and the Republicans. It was a blue abandonment. We now know that nine million fewer votes were cast nationwide in 2024 than in 2020. Trump got about a million more votes than he did in 2020 (700,000 of them in the seven battleground states). That’s no big deal. The bigger news is that Harris got 10 million fewer votes than Biden did in 2020 (400,000 fewer in the battleground states). Harris campaigned hard in the battlegrounds, so her erosion from Biden’s vote there wasn’t nearly as much, proportionately, as it was everywhere else across the country. The biggest takeaway is that Biden’s 9 million votes disappeared. Why? It couldn’t have been because of virulent racism because we elected a Black man, twice. It couldn’t have been misogyny, since Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than Trump in 2016, and Clinton’s actions and statements probably triggered more misogyny in 2016 than did Harris’s in 2024. There’s no evidence of illegal vote tampering or of voter suppression nearly on this scale. In fact, it was easier to cast a ballot this year than in 2020. So what happened to the 9 million? We can’t know for sure but it seems most likely that those 9 million potential voters — mostly working class — said to themselves, 'I won’t vote for Trump because he’s an asshole. But I won’t vote for the Democrats either, because they don’t give a damn about me.' The task for the Democrats is what it should have been all along: remaking the party into the party of the bottom 90 percent — the party of people who don’t live off stocks and bonds, of people who are not CEOs or billionaires like Mark Cuban, the party that rejects Elon Musk and the entire American oligarchy. Instead, the Democratic Party must be the party of average working people whose wages have gone nowhere and whose jobs are less secure. Blue-collar private-sector workers earned more on average in 1972, after adjusting for inflation, than they are earning now in 2024. This means today’s blue-collar workers are on average earning less in real dollars than their grandparents earned 52 years ago. Yet the American economy is far larger than it was 52 years ago. Where did the additional money go? To the top. So what’s the Democrats’ task? To restructure the economy toward more widely shared prosperity. This isn’t a blue-state versus red-state phenomenon. It’s a class phenomenon. In Missouri, one of the reddest of the red, voters passed an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by a wide margin, even as they overwhelmingly rejected Harris. It looks like they did the same in Alaska. In ruby-red Nebraska, roughly 75 percent of voters backed a measure to institute paid sick leave, although they rejected Harris. (Nebraskans also came close to unseating their incumbent senator in favor of Dan Osborn, a union activist who ran as an independent and railed against corporate overlords.) Americans across the board want a fairer economy. Trump Republicans won’t deliver one. Instead, Trump and his allies are readying more tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthy and regulatory rollbacks. They’re preparing to hand the country over to billionaires. Democrats! This is your opportunity! Take it! This article was published at Robert Reich's Substack	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSBtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-15T17:37:36-08:00	
Weapons From Libyan Stockpiles Flow To Terror Groups In Nigeria –...	Terrorists that plague northern Nigeria are arming themselves with weapons that originated in Libya, according to Nigerian defense officials. Weapons traffickers in Nigeria are benefitting from instability across the Sahel, particularly in Niger, which has become a key transit point for weapons taken from Libyan stockpiles. Those weapons have moved into other Sahel countries as well as Nigeria, according to the Small Arms Survey. 'When we talk about the proliferation of arms, first, you have to look at what happened in Libya years ago and in the Sahel,' Nigerian Maj. Gen. Edward Buba said during a recent briefing. 'Now, this gave the opportunity for arms to get into the wrong hands and then filtered into our country, which worsened the issue of insurgency and terrorism that we were faced with in the country.' In late October, Nigeria’s National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons destroyed 2,400 weapons confiscated from criminals across the country. Johnson Kokumo, the center’s director-general, said Nigeria would not tolerate the illegal trafficking of weapons into the country. 'These frameworks underscore the importance of transparent documentation and the responsible disposal of recovered arms, ensuring that they do not find their way back into the hands of criminal elements,' Kokumo said during the destruction ceremony in Abuja. The volume of illicit weapons into Nigeria has been described as 'like rice on the market,' with much of that traffic being traced back to Libya. 'This unlimited and unchecked proliferation of illegal arms has reached an epidemic level in Nigeria in recent times with attendant national security implications,' analyst Dakuku Peterside wrote for The Cable. The flow of weapons contributes to violence, crime and insecurity in the country. The 2011 collapse of the Libyan government under former dictator Moammar Gadhafi left the country’s massive weapons arsenals largely unguarded. The United Nations estimated in 2020 that Libya had as much as 200,000 tons of weapons at the time of its collapse. The subsequent civil wars made the security of Libya’s weapons stockpiles even worse. 'Those weapons were sitting virtually unguarded, destined for markets in the Sahel down south,' Defense News Nigeria wrote on X. 'At the apex of its power the Boko Haram campaign was being fueled by large scale heavy weapons supplies from [Gadhafi’s] looted vast arms stockpile.' Beyond its own stockpiles, Libya has also become a source of foreign weapons — many of them made in Russia and brought to the country by mercenaries connected to the former Wagner Group, now known as Africa Corps. Russia also uses Libyan ports to supply weapons to military juntas ruling Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Many of those weapons ultimately end up in the hands of terrorists in northern Nigeria, threatening civilians and Soldiers alike. Experts say terrorists have also captured weapons during raids on military outposts. In 2020, the Small Arms Survey estimated that Nigeria had 6.2 million small arms in the hands of civilians compared to about 580,000 in the hands of security forces. The presence of illicit weapons creates a vicious cycle of instability as local communities arm themselves to defend against terrorists and criminals, according to experts. That’s especially true in communities that feel ignored or overlooked by government security forces. 'Surging illicit arms flows have increased the availability of firearms in many communities,' researchers with the Small Arms Survey wrote in a study. 'Formerly low-level local conflicts thus risk violent escalation as traditional weapons — or, indeed, peaceful means of dispute settlement — are replaced with modern firearms.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSM7O1tblkgm4	2024-11-15T17:35:10-08:00	
Taliban Regime Post-US Withdrawal: Legitimacy Is Being Recognized...	In August 2021, the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces from Afghanistan precipitated the collapse of the previous Afghan government, resulting in the Taliban's resurgence and subsequent control over Kabul. For nearly twenty years, the insurgents have actively been involved in military confrontations with the US and NATO forces. Shortly after the withdrawal, thereafter, the Taliban announced the formation of a new government, which has yet to receive recognition from any foreign state or international organization. The cessation of development assistance, which previously accounted for 75% of the former government's expenditures, had come to an end abruptly by Western donors. The cutoff has precipitated a profound humanitarian and economic crisis in Afghanistan, exacerbated by the abrupt disintegration of the war economy alongside various other contributing factors. Since that time, the international community has pursued a strategy that balances selective engagement with the emerging regime alongside measures of isolation. Western nations have enacted a series of sanctions, asset freezes, and banking restrictions in response to the Taliban regime's significant constraints on the rights of women and girls, reflecting a deep-seated concern for human rights and gender equality. While certain countries have engaged in discreet dialogues with the Taliban concerning security issues, they have concurrently allocated billions of dollars towards poverty alleviation and famine prevention efforts. Through the establishment of trade agreements and the accreditation of Taliban ambassadors, neighbouring countries have adopted a more accommodative approach in their interactions with the newly formed government in Kabul. Although the systematic exclusion of women and girls from many facets of public life limits the benefits that half of the population receives from the positive changes, some aspects of Afghans' lives have improved and others have deteriorated three years after Taliban rule was renewed. Internal Perception of the Taliban Regime The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in 2021 after fighting against the foreign powers and the U.S.-backed Kabul government since 2001. Afghanistan's economy has fallen apart under Taliban rule. Job losses number in the hundreds of thousands, and malnutrition rates have been rising. The women have not been allowed to work. The Taliban regained control after the U.S.-backed government fell, threatening Afghans' civil and political rights, with the UN documenting human rights violations. Taliban intimidates journalists, restricts press freedoms, cracks down on demonstrations, and reinstates the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. Women face severe restrictions on secondary school, university teaching, and employment. Restricting women's employment may cost Afghanistan's GDP up to 5%, according to the UN Development Program. The Taliban's takeover has stalled the improvements in living standards, leaving nearly all Afghans in poverty and causing the economy to shrink by up to 30% since then. Security has improved, but violence persists, especially with the Islamic State in Khorasan targeting civilians. Some scholars have argued that many Afghans unequivocally abhor the Taliban's governance. Their adversaries predominantly consist of numerous individuals from ethnic groups distinct from the Pashtun majority of the Taliban, as well as men and women who contest the Taliban's limitations on women and girls, and those who prefer the freedoms and constitutional governance previously enjoyed over the opaque theocracy established by the new regime. The Emir's decisions seem to have irritated certain Taliban members, especially younger officials who contend that their government is lagging in a modernizing society. The protests by opium farmers signify that the Taliban's anti-drug campaign has resulted in a loss of support in certain provinces. Nevertheless, a small number of individuals within the population are in favor of the Taliban. The extent of this sentiment is once again challenging to ascertain; however, a significant number of Afghans, particularly those residing in the rural south and east, regard the regime change as a triumph for their right to self-determination. This is due to the fact that their side emerged victorious in the war, and their political convictions now have a greater influence in the capital. Women who either support the Taliban or oppose the years-long violence perpetrated across much of the nation by the security forces of the previous administration and its foreign backers comprise this constituency, which is predominantly Pashtun. A group of Afghans perceives the regime as a mixed bag, particularly in comparison to the previous governing structures, and does not express either support or opposition. For example, after decades of conflict, certain individuals may be appreciative of the newfound security but desire that women and girls faced fewer challenges. In addition to their disapproval of the Taliban's governance, numerous Afghans were also enraged by the corruption and oppression of previous regimes. The size of these constituencies has been particularly challenging to determine due to the severe flaws in Afghan polls. No De Jure Diplomatic Recognition The Taliban regime has not been recognized by most of the countries due to their concerns regarding its governance, violation of human rights, security, and non-compliance with international standards. The regime's lack of inclusivity, violations of human rights, and affiliations with terrorist organizations have prompted concerns regarding international security. Its governance exacerbates the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and undermines its legitimacy. This is perceived by numerous nations as a method of exerting pressure on the Taliban. The Taliban have governed Afghanistan as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan since 2021, when they overthrew the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan through force. The international community has widely condemned the takeover, and no nations have granted the new regime de jure diplomatic recognition, despite the fact that it ostensibly maintains relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban have been advocating for international recognition since assuming power. Some nations have declared that they will only recognize the Islamic Emirate if human rights are upheld there, while others have vowed never to do so. However, certain countries have granted Taliban diplomats the status of chargé d'affaires, despite their refusal to acknowledge the Islamic Emirate. Despite being the first nation to formally name a new ambassador to the country since the takeover in September 2023 and officially recognize the Taliban's envoy to China in January 2024, the PRC still does not formally recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. The United Arab Emirates also received a Taliban-appointed diplomat as the new ambassador of Afghanistan in August 2024. Neighbouring Countries’ Cautious Engagements with Taliban Although most of the countries have not formally recognized the Taliban, on the contrary, the neighboring countries such as India, China, and Russia have been engaging with them due to practical considerations. Security imperatives such as regional stability and counterterrorism are significant imperatives due to concerns regarding cross-border extremist group activities. Examples of strategic interests that are also relevant include Pakistan's ambition for power, China's Belt and Road Initiative, India's regional balance, and Russia's security in Central Asia. Engagement is also necessary for economic reasons, such as resolving Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis and gaining access to its resources. These countries employ a realpolitik strategy to achieve stability and influence, while simultaneously exerting pressure on the Taliban to moderate its rule and adhere to international standards. India has officially denied any consular appointments or recognition given to the Taliban government. However, recently it has conducted a diplomatic visit to Kabul, during which it met with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and acting defense minister Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob. India's recent visit to Afghanistan is indicative of its increasing diplomatic engagement with Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Since 2022, India has pursued a more pragmatic strategy to safeguard its interests in Afghanistan and the region, despite the fact that it did not officially recognize the Taliban government. India is collaborating with Afghanistan in a variety of ways, including the establishment of a technical team at the embassy, the admission of more than 3000 students since 2021, and participation in the 'Afghanistan Regional Cooperation Initiative' meeting in Kabul in 2024. Geopolitical interests, regional stability, and secure investments are all significantly impacted by India's engagement. The Zaranj-Delaram highway and the Afghan-India Friendship Dam are two critical infrastructure projects that India is supporting in Afghanistan. The latter offers an alternative route into landlocked Afghanistan by bypassing Pakistan and passing through Iran's Chabahar port. In India, the appointment of Ikramuddin Kamil as Acting Consul at the Mumbai consulate of Afghanistan is a pragmatic response to the requirements of Afghan nationals in India, however, the same does not constitute an endorsement of the Taliban regime. India ensures that consular services are maintained for the Afghan diaspora by prioritizing Kamil's Afghan identity over his Taliban affiliation. India's cautious selection of a familiar figure for this role is further mirrored by his Indian-educated background. The action underscores India's changing strategy of restricted engagement with the Taliban, which prioritizes regional stability and operational requirements while simultaneously upholding its non-recognition stance in collaboration with the international community. Moscow has announced its intention to normalize relations with the Taliban-led government of Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations. The Taliban's human rights violations, particularly those related to women's rights, have been the subject of international concern. Despite these concerns, the removal is perceived as a humanitarian response to the crisis in Afghanistan, offering crucial assistance to alleviate criticism. Russia regards the Taliban as its most effective ally in addressing the threat posed by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), which it regards as a more immediate threat to regional stability than the Taliban itself. The normalization of Moscow's relations with the Taliban government, which is still not recognized by any country in the world, would be facilitated by the removal of the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations and the lifting of sanctions against the group. The Taliban's transition to normalization is a component of Russia's strategy to establish stronger partnerships with the primary adversaries of ISKP (Fazl-e-Haider, 2024 November 13). The Taliban's potential support for militants in Xinjiang was a primary concern for China, which expressed its willingness to engage with them after the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. In June 2022, a catastrophic earthquake in southeastern Afghanistan prompted China to provide substantial humanitarian aid, including $7.5 million and supplies. The Taliban publicly acknowledged this action. Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Co (CAPEIC), a Chinese oil company, executed a substantial contract with the Taliban in January 2023. The contract, which was valued at $150 million for the initial year and $540 million by 2026, was intended to increase oil extraction and generate approximately 3,000 jobs. Furthermore, a Chinese mining company was in the process of negotiating the continuation of operations at a copper mine in Logar province. A significant diplomatic move was made by China in September 2023 when it appointed Zhao Xing as its first ambassador to Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover. By December 2023, Bilal Karimi, Afghanistan's Ambassador to China, presented his credentials to President Xi Jinping, thereby fortifying diplomatic relations. China maintains trade, investment, and aid discussions with the Taliban government, despite the fact that it has not formally recognized it. This policy is driven by the desire to prevent Uyghur separatists from utilizing Afghanistan as a base for activities against the Chinese state. China's diplomatic and economic interactions suggest a strategic interest in maintaining influence in Afghanistan, despite the country's ambiguous stance on recognizing the Taliban as of January 2024. Conclusion The international community has yet to recognize the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal due to its human rights violations and affiliation with terrorism. But India, Russia, and China have engaged with the Taliban in a practical manner due to their concerns for regional stability, economic gain, and security. While Western countries remain isolated and subject to sanctions, regional powers leverage trade, economic agreements, and diplomatic relations to exert influence, despite their lack of official recognition. Afghanistan's future international legitimacy will be contingent upon the Taliban's capacity to address critical issues such as human rights and women's rights, as well as the evolving geopolitical dynamics of the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSDxQzcghq1AP	2024-11-15T17:32:37-08:00	
Earlier Activities Of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board: Looking Bac...	The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, India’s nuclear regulator is completing 41 years of age. It is the time for calm contemplation and accounting of what AERB has done thus far. If any reader delves deeper, he may legitimately feel that my views are most likely to be biased. Let me declare my conflict of interest. I was one among the first handful of officers who joined the Board from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). I was the Secretary of the Board from August 1987 to January 2004. I strongly defend my turf. However, I also make every effort to give references to authentic documents to buttress my views. One can get a bird’s eye view of the regulatory activities of AERB during its formative years here. Pioneers recall that when India’s Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) started the design and construction of its first research reactor Apsara in 1955, there was no formal safety analysis report. Designers of various systems of the reactor on their own ensured the safety of the design. I hasten to add that it was the case all over the world. A robust regulatory system in which many specialists from different disciplines participated evolved soon. (One can read the history of the regulatory activities in the field of nuclear energy and its applications from here, here, here and here) . Safety Reviews The Board’s safety review covered unusual incidents at Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (1980-84), Quality Control and Quality Assurance at NPPs 1985, Radiation exposures in power plants 1988, Operational safety at Taraput Atomic Power Station (TAPS) 1985 and Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) and Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) 1989, the Narora Fire Incident 1993 and the Failure of containment dome in Kaiga 1994,. This reference contains details of various reviews. AERB appointed special committees to review safety features of Indian nuclear power plants considering accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima. The AERB secretariat diligently followed up the recommendations of these committees. Early reviews AERB started safety review and licensing of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) from Narora 1 onwards. Over the years, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) introduced newer projects, such as PHWRs of 540 MWe at Tarapur and 700 MWe at several sites, Kudankulam plant (VVER type Russian nuclear power reactors of 1000 MWe), Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor of 500 MWe etc. Safety reviews of foreign nuclear power reactors of higher capacity also started. Newer developments include SMR. These offer future challenges. Regulatory control of medical x rays a daunting task. A review of what AERB has done, particularly to enforce regulatory control on medical x-ray equipment and installations can be seen here . Effective regulatory control of medical x-ray units in India is a daunting task, as medical x-ray use grew in an unbridled way nationwide for many decades. In 1986, AERB held a National Seminar on 'Radiation exposures in Medical X-ray Practices: Consequences and Control'. Many senior officials (Directors of Health Services, Directors of Medical Education) from State Governments, radiologists, representatives of allied professional associations, radiographers, x-ray unit manufacturers, x-ray tube makers, officers from Medical Council of India and Director General of Health Services and others participated. Simultaneously AERB set up a specialist committee with Dr Arcot Gajraj as Chairman. The committee had representation from Directorate General of Health Services, DRP/BARC and AERB. Its recommendations included type approval of equipment, organization of training courses with emphasis on safety, preparation of safety codes and guides, registration of x-ray equipment and installations among others. AERB enhanced the type approvals for x-ray equipment with the assistance from Radiological Protection and Advisory Division (RP&AD) of BARC. AERB implemented most of the recommendations. AERB entered an MOU with CSIR and DRDO to organize a nation-wide x-ray registration program. AERB coordinated with Radiological Physics Division of BARC and trained 125 inspectors for the program. They were middle level officers from the respective regional laboratories of DRDO and CSIR. The program covered all 500 districts in the country. AERB collected invaluable information on the status of medical x-ray safety. AERB conveyed remedial measures on obvious safety deficiencies to these institutions. To our knowledge, no country has attempted such a massive program anywhere else in the world. The program covered over 30,300 x-ray units. In a mid-way analysis, AERB found that the age of nearly 9% of the 15528 units registered was unknown. One out of five units was over 15 years old. The AERB found several obvious deficiencies and recommended remedial actions. AERB’s efforts to decentralize regulatory control on medical x rays by authorizing State Governments were not successful. However, now there is some light at the end of the tunnel, as AERB developed and deployed its e-governance initiative for e- Licensing of Radiation Applications ‘e-LORA’. AERB extended e-LORA successfully to other areas as well. AERB received the 'SKOCH Smart Governance Award -2015' for e-LORA. AERB helps DAE in drafting new rules The promulgation of Atomic Energy Act 1962 and the Radiation Protection Rules, 1971 gave the initial legal framework to safety. AERB issued surveillance procedures for medical applications of radiation under Rule 15 of the RPR 1971. AERB also published a safety code on medical x-ray equipment and installations. These documents provided a firmer legal basis for enforcing safety provisions. Promulgation of Atomic Energy (radiation Protection) Rules 2004 helped to remove virtually all the legal infirmities. However, AERB’s constitution order needs revision Some Past Regulatory Actions Has AERB exercised its powers? AERB’s Annual report contains the regulatory actions taken by the Board. I recall that the first question a journalist asked me was whether AERB has any teeth! AERB was just born then. If an infant has teeth when born, it will be a freak I joked. The question inspired us to review the Atomic Energy Act 1962. When the Controller and Auditor General of India made an incorrect interpretation of certain provisions in the Atomic Energy Act we could easily identify it. (Please see here) Recovery of highly active sources from Coovum River !n 1993, someone stole three radioactive sources from the premises of a foreign company based in India, and engaged by Oil & Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) for oil well-logging operations. AERB ordered suspension of all its well logging operations using radioactive sources in India. Eventually based on the inputs from police, AERB’s team recovered the sources from Coovum River within the Chennai city limits. AERB permitted the use of sources after ONGC reinforced more measures to ensure security of the sources. The disgruntled workers involved got jail terms Regulatory actions against hospitals AERB endorsed the Division of Radiological Protection (DRP)’s decision on withdrawal of radium sources from hospitals as many of them were leaky or prone to develop leakage and were hazardous. Removal of radium led to the introduction of safer substitutes in cancer treatment, improved dosimetry, and better radiation protection. On April 6, 1995, AERB barred a cancer hospital in Delhi from treating new patients because of safety violations. The Board lifted the ban when the hospital fulfilled the safety requirements. Other developments In 1987, AERB prescribed permissible limits for radionuclides in foodstuffs when there was a possibility of the import of contaminated foodstuffs after the Chernobyl accident. One can get related details here. The Mayapuri radiation accident, which led to the death of one person and radiation injury to many, offered a wakeup call. AERB implemented stricter measures on keeping track of sources immediately. AERB issued an advisory to medical/dental x-ray owners and the general public against indiscriminate use of dental x-ray examinations solely for the purpose of non-diagnostic applications such as age determination or birth registration. In 2012, the Controller and Auditor General of India (CAG) gave a critical report on AERB. AERB staff noted that some reports criticized the CAG report (please see here, here and here). While noting in a lighter mood, that Accountants are seldom pleasant, we must admit that the appraisal of CAG offered an invaluable wake up call to AERB. The Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee endorsed CAG recommendations . As directed by CAG, AERB prepared a policy document. Through e-LORA, it implemented an online program for all its licensing activities. It issued a large number of safety documents. Anyone can download them freely from AERB web site. CAG’s proposal to make AERB’ legal framework stronger is pending with the Ministry which hopefully may accord priority to it. Closer perusal of AERB’s Annual report shows that AERB strengthened all regulatory activities as directed by CAG. The International Atomic Energy Agency carried out Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) mission during March 16-27, 2015. India is among the few countries, which published the report. AERB’s Annual report, which summarizes AERB activities are available at www.aerb.gov.in Safety Research Institute The objective of Safety Research Institute(SRI) is to build a unique research and knowledge base with a strong research capability in important safety related areas to support regulatory functions of AERB. Under the initiative of Prof. P. Rama Rao, the then Chairman, AERB, Safety Research Institute was setup at Kalpakkam. The foundation stone for the institute was laid on February 20, 1999 by Dr. R. Chidambaram, the then Chairman, AEC during the IX Five Year Plan period with P. Rodriguez as first Director of the Institute. SRI conducts independent safety research to supplement the Boards’ regulatory review and assessment activities. Looking forward AERB must be circumspect in enforcing changes in universally accepted radiation protection philosophy which has robustly and soundly stood the test of time. 'Radiation hormesis' for instance is a very popularly discussed phenomena. A major problem is that it is not possible to arrive at a scientifically defendable threshold dose. In order to appreciate the associated concepts such as Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model and ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) etc. the regulators must read the following references. Federal Register :: Linear No-Threshold Model and Standards for Protection Against Radiation )ALARA: The History and Science of Radiation Safety I strongly endorse the following conclusion from Ref 2 'Despite its genesis in public opinion rather than scientific investigation, the ALARA protocol has successfully limited the exposure of radiation workers to impressively low levels of around 1 mSv. The grounding of ALARA is in the linear-no-threshold hypothesis, which states that risk is directly proportional to dose, even for the smallest exposures. Although significant costs are incurred to conform to ALARA and the validity of the LNT model is unclear below doses of 100 mSv, more research on the health effects of low radiation doses is necessary before alternatives to ALARA can become viable.' I hope that AERB will stick to that view. Further reading (Key Note Address by the writer at the IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS-2022)on 11 November 2022) BEST WISHES TO ALL ON THE FOUNDATION DAY OF AERB Please see this you tube documentary on one of the most important policy decisions by AERB- prescribing the permissible limits radionuclides in foodstuffs,- It is by Shri Ajitesh Sharma. He got many awards (a few international). Towards the end, I explain how AERB took the decision. This was shown in some OTT platforms in India Here is the link: From a fledgling organization with a handful of members occupying two rooms at the Old Yacht Club, opposite Gate way India, Mumbai, AERB grew into a strong regulatory agency. AERB now occupies three buildings. When I reviewed AERB staff strength and their qualifications on November 15, 2017, exactly seven years ago it had a total staff strength of 346, over 250 of them Group A officers. Of them, 21 have Ph.D. degrees. All of them had special training in one or more of the subjects such as nuclear engineering, radiation safety, medical physics etc. All of them are graduates or postgraduates; many of them have M. Tech degrees from IITs. Uniquely for a regulatory agency, five or six of them secured law degrees and they reinforce the legal cell of AERB. I look forward to the legal cell to defend their turf against any attempt unintended or deliberate to dilute the existing legal powers of the Board. AERB looks forward to future challenges with renewed zeal, commitment and enthusiasm. The mood is upbeat in the AERB.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSOFb4avN7oh8	2024-11-15T17:28:30-08:00	
Rubio As US Top Diplomat Could Be A Win For Southeast Asian Human...	By David Hutt U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Sen. Marco Rubio as his secretary of state is likely to send a jolt of excitement to beleaguered democrats and opposition forces in Southeast Asia’s authoritarian states. Over the past five or so years, Rubio has co-authored almost every congressional bill on human rights in Southeast Asia. He co-introduced the Cambodia Democracy and Human Rights Act in 2022, stating at the time that 'the Hun Sen dictatorship destroyed democracy in Cambodia and allowed the nation to be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.' He reintroduced the bill in 2023. In 2020, Rubio appealed to the State Department to designate Vietnam a 'country of particular concern' for abuse of religious freedom, noting that 'the only way to realize the full potential of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship is to press them to take serious steps to improve the human rights situation in Vietnam.' A year earlier, he co-introduced the Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act to the Senate, which, had it passed, would have pressured the White House to impose 'sanctions and travel restrictions on Vietnamese nationals complicit in human rights abuses.' He was critical of the Obama administration’s rush to renormalize ties with Myanmar’s semi-military government in the early 2010s, and unabashed in saying the Burmese military orchestrated a 'genocide' against the Rohingya. In 2021, he was one of six senators to call on the Biden administration to impose much tougher sanctions on the military junta that took power in Myanmar through a coup in February that year. In 2017, he tried to introduce legislation to restrict the export of defense articles to the Philippines in response to then-President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal and illegal war on drugs. The same year, he challenged U.S. Secretary of State Nominee Rex Tillerson to pressure Duterte about his 'human rights violations.' China-hawk Rubio is principally known as a China-hawk, and he has been blacklisted by Beijing in retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials for the genocide against the Uyghur ethnic minority and for the crackdown in Hong Kong. He has co-sponsored numerous bills against the Chinese Communist Party’s human rights violations, including the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Reauthorization Act and numerous Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Reauthorization Acts. Last year, he introduced the Deterring Chinese Preemptive Strikes Act to strengthen American air bases in the Indo-Pacific region. He was the arch-campaigner against TikTok and Huawei, and for the past decade has fought resolutely to bring attention against Beijing’s genocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang region. However, a blinkered China-hawk who perceives all foreign relations through the Beijing prism would not have sponsored resolutions condemning the Communist Party of Vietnam, which the 'realists' in the Biden administration courting Hanoi treated as an ally beyond reproach. Rubio’s actions indicate he knows that America cannot be indolent about the sins of its friends. Perhaps he has tempered some of his views, but Rubio would appear to be instinctively interventionist and instinctively knows that America has a duty to not only promote global prosperity but also global liberty. During Trump’s first term, Rubio co-sponsored legislation to make it harder for the U.S. to withdraw from NATO. His more controversial comments about the Ukraine war – 'I’m not on Russia’s side, but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement’ – can be read in multiple, not all isolationist, ways. Promoting values Even if the senator who has been outspoken on human rights has to temper his views while serving as the top U.S. diplomat, it will still be heartening to have a U.S. secretary of state who has spent as much time with Southeast Asian dissidents, exiles and opposition politicians as with government officials and chambers of commerce. It will be positive to have an American foreign affairs chief who knows Cambodia is a 'dictatorship,' who says Myanmar’s generals committed 'genocide,' and who called out Duterte’s drug war for human rights violations. At least since the Obama administration, there’s been a tendency to appoint senior Asia officials who spent considerable time in the region. This brought expertise, but it also brought a certain mindset from those who previously 'had to get along with' the region’s tyrannical regimes. If Trump was isolationist and transactional in his first term, there’s been a temptation by the Biden administration to single-mindedly focus on alliance building against China, without sufficient thought for the local inhabitants of those allies. Indeed, it’s difficult to exaggerate not just how little the Biden administration did for human rights in Southeast Asia as his foreign policy pursued realpolitik goals. Rubio’s record suggests he will remind U.S. leaders and diplomats why they are effectively fighting a new Cold War against China – it isn’t only about trade margins and tariffs and spheres of influence. If he is able to temper Trump’s transactional instincts toward foreign leaders no matter how unsavory, Rubio is someone who could pursue a more muscular foreign policy against China without forgetting that key values are a factor in the rivalry.

Trump’s Chance To Atone For America’s Afghan Shame – Analysis	By Luke Coffey It is rare for anyone to be given a second chance in politics: for American presidents, it has happened only once before Donald Trump’s re-election. The only other US president to serve two non-consecutive terms was Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. This gives Trump a rare opportunity to reflect on past mistakes and learn from them to make better decisions in the future. Such an opportunity is with Afghanistan. The chaotic and disorganized departure from Afghanistan in August 2021 remains a stain on US honor and prestige. It did not have to end that way. While President Joe Biden bears most of the responsibility, the story is incomplete without considering the role of the first Trump administration. In February 2020, Trump agreed on a deal with the Taliban that set a date for the phased withdrawal of US forces by May 2021. This was the foundation for the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban’s return to power. Trump even went so far as to entertain the idea of inviting Taliban leaders to Camp David, though his advisers wisely convinced him to abandon it. Despite these missteps, one thing united Trump and Biden: their desire to exit Afghanistan, no matter the consequences. The Trump administration, with its deal, laid the groundwork for the disaster that followed under Biden. Now, after securing a second term, Trump has the opportunity to correct course, learn from the past, and implement a more thoughtful and effective Afghanistan policy. Since the Taliban took over in 2021, Afghanistan has plunged into a severe economic and humanitarian crisis. Young girls are still banned from school, women have been pushed out of most workplaces, and the country has become a hotbed for transnational terrorist groups. Al-Qaeda has reestablished its presence and Daesh has gained strength, exploiting the security vacuum left by the Taliban. With a new team in place, there is potential for the Trump administration to reevaluate and recalibrate. The nomination of Florida Congressman Mike Waltz as national security adviser signals a possible shift. Waltz, a former US special forces officer who served several tours in Afghanistan, has been one of the most vocal critics of Biden’s withdrawal. He has cultivated relationships with the National Resistance Front, a prominent Afghan opposition group led by Ahmad Massoud, and is keenly aware of the counterterrorism challenges posed by a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Trump administration has the opportunity to reengage with anti-Taliban forces and place greater emphasis on US national security interests. The first step should be formalizing communications with Massoud and his group, which is the most credible armed resistance to the Taliban but which the Biden administration has ignored. At the very least, the US should consider establishing a liaison office for the group in Tajikistan. The US should also consider moving its diplomatic mission to Tajikistan from Qatar, where it decamped from Kabul after the Taliban takeover. While Qatar has been a key player in Taliban talks, a move to Tajikistan would bring American diplomats closer to both Afghanistan and the National Resistance Front. It would also reflect a broader strategy in Central Asia, prioritizing long-term stability and counterterrorism cooperation. At a minimum, the US should open a second diplomatic mission in Tajikistan while maintaining the one in Doha. Another key area is the Vienna Process, a series of regular meetings of anti-Taliban groups led by the National Resistance Front with which the US has so far failed to engage. Trump’s administration should change that by sending a high-level representative to the next meeting. If it is willing to engage with Taliban representatives in Doha, it only makes sense to do so with the opposition groups too. The US should also explore ways in which the National Resistance Front could advance counterterrorism objectives in Afghanistan. Neither the US nor its allies have invested in developing a relationship with the group. While the US has limited over-the-horizon strike capabilities in Afghanistan, the Front could be a valuable partner. Strengthening ties could offer operational advantages, particularly in the fight against Al-Qaeda and Daesh. One area where the Biden administration has been correct is in its non-recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate government. They desperately seek international legitimacy, which the US has rightly prevented. Trump should continue this policy, but more aggressively — freezing any potential funding from US sources that might benefit the Taliban, and ramping up sanctions against them. These steps would mark a crucial shift in policy. They would improve counterterrorism efforts, safeguard geopolitical interests in South and Central Asia, and demonstrate a commitment to a moral and strategic alignment with credible Afghan partners. History shows that Afghanistan is too important to ignore. While it is unlikely that American troops will return in the immediate future, before 9/11 nobody predicted a US intervention. In such a scenario, a relationship with the Front would give the US a trusted local ally and a valuable insurance policy for the future. Trump’s second term is a unique opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past and pursue a more coherent and effective Afghanistan strategy. It is time to move on from the chaotic withdrawal of 2021 and lay the groundwork for a more stable and secure Afghanistan in the future. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Gazprom Stops Supplying Gas To Austria	By Nikolaus J. Kurmayer (EurActiv) -- The Russian energy company Gazprom will stop sending gas to Austria effectively this weekend, said the country's energy major supplier, OMV. After OMV was awarded €230 million in damages in an arbitration against Gazprom, it announced its intention to stop paying bills to recoup the money. In response, the state-owned Russian company is turning off the tap, the company said on Friday. From 6am on Saturday (16 November), Gazprom will no longer send gas to Austria despite its contract with OMV until 2040 – the energy major is the only direct buyer of Russian gas, which makes up more than 90% of the supply. 'OMV ... has just been informed by Gazprom Export that Gazprom Export will suspend - and thus reduce to 0% - its deliveries of natural gas,' the company said in a statement. Despite that, Austria is not expecting an immediate gas shortage in the coming winter – the country’s storage facilities hold a whole year’s supply and are 90% full. The move potentially ends a six-decade history of Austria receiving gas from Russia, first offered after Moscow blocked the alpine country from joining the EU, forcing it to remain a neutral country in the Cold War. 'The actions of Russia’s Gazprom today prove once again that Russia is not a partner,’ said Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Greens) in a statement. 'But tomorrow also marks the end of a risk. If we no longer receive supplies from Russia, we can no longer be blackmailed,' she added. Austria is locked into a long-term contract until 2040 and may now finally be able to break it in a way unlikely to see the company lose any arbitration case. Previously, OMV’s arbitration win against Gazprom has already pushed Europe’s nervous gas markets to a three-month high, with a 10% price increase since the company announced its award on 13 November. The energy major is already betting on contracted gas from Norway and global LNG markets to replace Gazprom supplies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSNRB809r9qnu	2024-11-15T17:16:14-08:00	
Scholz Speaks To Putin About Ukraine War, Drawing Concern From Ky...	(RFE/RL) -- Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by telephone on November 15, urging the Kremlin leader to end the war against Ukraine and negotiate with Kyiv for a 'just and lasting peace,' the chancellor's office said. But the first direct conversation in nearly two years between the German and Russian leaders elicited a warning from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who said Scholz's call was a 'Pandora's box' that could help Putin 'ease his isolation, Russia's isolation, and engage in conventional negotiations that won't end in anything.' Zelenskiy said such empty exchanges are 'exactly what Putin has been wanting for a long time' as the 2 1/2-year-old full-scale invasion grinds on. Scholz expressed 'unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,' Berlin said. 'The chancellor condemned Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and called on President Putin to end it and withdraw troops,' Scholz's office said. It also said Scholz spoke with Zelenskiy before the Putin call and would speak again afterward. The Kremlin said the conversation came at Germany's request and was 'a detailed and frank exchange of views on the situation in Ukraine.'It repeated Moscow talking points on the origins of the conflict in 'NATO's long-term aggressive policy' and said Russia had 'never refused and remains open to resuming negotiations.' It cited a speech by Putin in June and said any possible deal should take Russian security interests into account along with 'new territorial realities and, most importantly, eliminate the root causes of the conflict.'Putin, the Kremlin said, described Russian-German relations as having suffered 'unprecedented degradation in all areas' and said Russia was prepared for 'mutually beneficial cooperation' in the energy sector. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Scholz talked to him afterward and that Warsaw was satisfied he 'reiterated the Polish position: 'Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.'' Reuters quoted a source as saying Scholz told Putin that the deployment of North Korean troops for combat missions is a significant escalation and expansion of the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSJudE0KpbDHJ	2024-11-15T17:12:43-08:00	
Kim Jong Un Wants North Korea To Mass Produce Suicide Drones	By Soyoung Kim North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wants the country to begin mass production of suicide drones, raising concerns that Pyongyang could potentially send these to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine. State media reported that the country’s supreme leader Kim Jong Un visited a test site for the unmanned attack aircraft. 'The suicide attack drones, designed to be used within different striking ranges on the ground and the sea, are to perform a precision attack mission against any enemy targets,' the Korea Central News Agency report said. In tests, the drones 'precisely hit' targets, it said. Kim 'underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,' the report said. Though the report made no mention of the possibility of North Korea manufacturing drones to be sold to Russia, several analysts said that North Korea might look to do just that. The war is the motivation behind North Korean drone development, Bruce Bennett, a researcher at the U.S.-based RAND Corporation told RFA Korean. 'Putin wants cheap weapons, and Kim Jong Un can produce them,' said Bennett. 'I suspect that Russia transferred drone technology to support North Korea’s production.' He also noted that any North Korean ability to mass-produce drones could be a potential threat to South Korea. The successful test of suicide drones as reported by North Korean state media is a concern in light of the deepening ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, Bruce Klingner of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation said. Klingner said that North Korea has already provided Russia with artillery shells, ballistic missiles, and over 10,000 troops. He also said that the recent ratification of a comprehensive bilateral security treaty between Russia and North Korea suggests that Moscow might soon increase transfer of military technology to Pyongyang. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department expressed concern over the deepening relationship, calling it and its associated weapons transfers 'a trend that should be of great concern to anyone who is interested in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, preserving the global nonproliferation regime, and supporting the Ukrainian people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSHx9MCMotad2	2024-11-15T17:06:42-08:00	
‘Anarchy If Interim Govt Fails,’ Says Official From Bangladesh’s ...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury After being in the political wilderness for 15 years, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir is a man in a hurry to see his political party, the largest one in Bangladesh, potentially return to power. Fakhrul, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secretary-general, wants the interim government that was installed after then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country to speed up the reforms required to hold free and fair elections. Many political analysts say the BNP very likely will be elected. Before Hasina’s decade-and-a-half at the helm, Bangladesh twice alternated between voting for her Awami League and the BNP. Hasina left for India after a student protest against job quotas became a mass movement demanding she resign because security forces fired on protesters. More than 800 people died during these movements. After she ran away, an interim administration backed by university students who led the mass movement, civil society members and parties except the Awami League, has been at the helm of affairs in the South Asian nation for a little over 100 days. The mandate of this administration led by 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus is to make the country and the state apparatus ready to hold an impartial and democratic general election. Hasina and her Awami League had governed Bangladesh since 2009, winning four consecutive elections, including two boycotted by the BNP and its allies in 2014 and January 2024, and one widely criticized as rigged in 2018. Many of Fakhrul’s BNP colleagues are impatient and clamoring for swift elections, but he said three months is nearly not enough time to repair the damage done to state institutions during 15 years of Hasina’s rule. And repairing many of those institutions is an essential prerequisite for a truly democratic national election. Fakhrul recently sat down with BenarNews for 30 minutes to discuss the future election and reasons for the continued lawlessness in Bangladesh, among other issues. Excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity: BenarNews: What do you expect most from the interim government and has it performed to your satisfaction? Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir: The biggest expectation is that it will complete the [necessary] reforms expeditiously and hold an impartial, free election acceptable to all. During the last 15 years, Hasina and her party destroyed Bangladesh politically, economically and socially. Considering all this, the interim government has moved to constitute an Election Commission, formed a search committee and sought names. They have started the work. That work will be complete soon. BN: You have said many times that the BNP wants to give the interim government 'logical time.' How do you define this? MFIA: By 'logical time,' I mean the time by when the election commission can become a completely impartial body so that an unhindered, fair and impartial election can be held. BN: You say the constitution needs amending. Why? MFIA: The Awami League government destroyed the [original] 1972 constitution and made it a charter of fascism. So its reform is a crying need. Otherwise, nothing can be fixed. BN: The BNP has been repeating that this interim government should not fail. Why? MFIA: The consequences [of it failing] may be dangerous. The [Awami League] fascists may come back. Anarchy may follow … which is not desirable for anyone. BN: After Hasina fled, street protests have been held over trifling issues, officials were forced to resign and some beaten up. Why is there still so much lawlessness? MFIA: That is because Bangladesh has not experienced true democratic practices. They did not dare to speak out. Now they can, and are doing so freely. Additionally, Awami League supporters are causing mischief on the online instructions from India by Hasina. BN: There is uproar in the international media that minority communities such as Hindus were attacked after Hasina fell and continue to be under threat in this Muslim-majority country. Is this happening, and if so, why? MFIA: Let me make this clear: In three districts in southeastern Bangladesh, Hindu idols were vandalized. It was proven that the Awami League’s student wing was behind the attacks, but the government took no action. And there was no uproar in the international media. There were some problems immediately after the political change. But they were not communal. They were political. Take the case of Hasina. She is a Muslim and she fled. The house of Hasina’s Muslim adviser was looted. Why? They were Awami Leaguers. People have massive hate for the Awami League. The Awami League wants to make it an issue that the BNP or Bangladesh is persecuting minorities. BN: Similarly, the Awami League and others allege that militancy will return if the BNP comes to power. What’s your response? MFIA: We have not supported militancy. We will not support militancy – zero tolerance. The Awami League manufactures these stories. Yes, you can say that there is a move toward fundamentalism. And the Awami League is responsible for that. They blocked the path of democracy, and when you do that, fundamentalism is sure to flourish. We were the first government to arrest all militants. BN: As you wait for the election to be announced, what advice do you have for political parties including BNP? MFIA: I have only one. All of us must be patriots, must work for the people’s welfare and not abuse power if in government. We believe the BNP will in no way repeat the Awami League’s mistakes. If we do, we will have to face the same consequences it did.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSF8i5kwdxT2n	2024-11-15T17:04:28-08:00	
Republican Lawmakers Optimistic Trump Can End Russia-Ukraine War	Top Republican members of the House of Representatives say lawmakers have begun discussions about Russia’s war in Ukraine in an effort to carry out President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to quickly end the conflict there. Lawmakers told VOA’s Ukrainian Service that they are optimistic that Trump can achieve his goal. Republican Representative Mike Waltz, who was nominated by Trump this week to be his national security adviser, told VOA that 'the president has been clear in terms of getting both sides to the table and is focused on ending the war and not perpetuating it.' Waltz said that while Trump did not address Russia’s war in Ukraine when he gave a speech to lawmakers at their leadership meeting Wednesday, he said discussions about the war were happening 'off to the side.' He did not give further details. Republican Representative Mike Rogers, who serves as the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, was bullish about Trump’s ability to negotiate a cease-fire. 'I expect the president to negotiate an armistice before the end of the year,' he told VOA. When asked how the United States would pressure Russia to lay down its weapons, he said, 'I have an idea what it is but I’m not going to talk about it.' Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week and urged him not to escalate the war, according to U.S. media outlets, first reported in The Washington Post. The Kremlin denies the call took place. Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who has been a strong supporter of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, told VOA that Trump wants to have a 'very strong military presence in Europe,' part of a 'path of deterrence that eventually will get us to a period of negotiation.' However, he cautioned that he does not believe that Ukraine has enough leverage right now for successful negotiations with Russia. Russia and Ukraine are engaged in fierce battles in eastern Ukraine, as uncertainty mounts over how a Trump presidency will affect the war and whether the two sides will be pushed into negotiations. Analysts say that both sides are looking to increase their territory before any negotiations take place. When asked about how the U.S. could pressure Russia to the negotiating table, Republican Representative Tom Cole, who serves as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told VOA, 'I think you have to persuade them what is in their best interest.' Cole said he thinks the war has been a disaster for Russia, noting that the conflict pushed Sweden and Finland to join NATO, the Western military alliance formed in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. He said talks in the House have not yet led to any definitive plan on the Russia-Ukraine war, but said, 'I think there is just hope that President Trump can bring this conflict in Europe — the worst conflict since 1945 — to a speedy end.' Trump has yet to detail how he will fulfill his campaign pledge to end the war quickly. During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September, Trump said he 'can work out something that's good for both sides.' When asked at that time whether Ukraine should turn over some of its own land to Russia to end the war, Trump said, 'We'll see what happens.' Vice President Kamala Harris said on the campaign trail that suggestions by the Trump camp to create a demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine at the current battle lines 'are not proposals for peace.' 'Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable,' she said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured Ukraine and its NATO allies Wednesday that Washington remains committed to putting Ukraine 'in the strongest possible position' in the final months of President Joe Biden’s administration. 'President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th,' Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. Trump told reporters in September that his plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war is 'not a surrender.' 'What my strategy is, is to save lives,' he said. Kateryna Lisunova contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcQA7BzlxWSPhwhj6GpDnW	2024-11-15T16:59:41-08:00	
Behind The Iran-Israel Conflict – OpEd	However many charges of aggression, mass murder and worse the Iranian regime chooses to level against Israel, there is no disguising the fact that it is Iran that seeks to destroy Israel, not the other way around. On April 13, 2024 Iran – which essentially means the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – committed a major strategic blunder. Israel’s audacious attack on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus on April 1, 2024 had taken out seven Iranian military advisers, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the élite Quds Force of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). Such an operation would normally have provoked Iranian ire and an armed response on northern Israel from Hezbollah. Not on this occasion. Instead the incident was used as the trigger for a fundamental shift in Iranian policy which has led to negative consequences for Iran. They are still to be fully worked through and may, in the final analysis, prove existential. For 45 years – namely, since its foundation in 1979 – the Iranian regime had pursued its self-imposed mission of encompassing the destruction of Israel and its people through funding, arming and supporting organizations, groups and militias prepared to attack the Jewish state. At some point in the period leading up to April 13 Khamenei decided that the time had arrived to change tack. It must have been intense analysis and calculation by his advisers that led him to break the principle that had guided Iran’s foreign strategy for so long, and finally launch Iran’s very first direct onslaught on Israel. How must the figuring have gone? 'Israel has never been weaker. It is bogged down in its war in Gaza. It hasn’t succeeded in eliminating Hamas or recovering its remaining hostages. It is being condemned on all sides for vast numbers of civilian deaths. Hezbollah is attacking it daily on its northern border. Houthi missiles are getting through its defenses. It is the subject of an investigation by the International Court of Justice on a charge of genocide. Imagine the effect of a direct Iranian attack. Think of bombs falling on Israeli cities. Think of Israelis in their hundreds slaughtered and injured. Israel will be humbled. The Abraham Accords will disintegrate, and any hope of their extension will be snuffed out.' Khamenei’s military advisers must have convinced him that a massive fleet of kamikaze UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) would overwhelm Israel’s defenses, and at least some 50% of the missiles would get through. The aerial assault involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. In the event Khamenei’s anticipated military and propaganda triumph turned into a humiliation. What Iran’s military strategists perhaps failed to take into account was the united support of Israel’s allies, and Iran's own unpopularity in the Arab world (Iranians may be Muslim, but they are not Arabs). They surely did not count on Jordan and Saudi Arabia helping to block Iran's UAVs from reaching Israel, nor that the UK and France would join the US in backing Israel's Iron Dome in shooting down the Iranian missiles. Their subsequent failure was to underestimate both the chutzpah and effectiveness of Israel’s security and armed forces. Following the aerial assault of April 13, the Iranians were taken by surprise time and again. Within a week Israel had responded with airstrikes on Iranian military sites in Syria and Iran itself, while against a background of continuing tit-for-tat skirmishes, Israel pursued its hunt for the Hamas leaders responsible for the barbaric attack of October 7, and the Hezbollah leaders who supported them. The targeted elimination of Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’s military wing, on July 13 was followed by the even more telling retribution visited on Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas’s political wing. In an especial humiliation for the regime, he was killed in the heart Iran’s capital, Tehran, by an explosion in his guesthouse, on July 31. Then came September 17-18, when hand-held communication devices, such as pagers and walkie-talkies, manufactured specifically for Hezbollah and distributed widely to its operatives, were detonated remotely. At least 42 fatalities and over 3,000 injuries, the vast majority of them Hezbollah operatives, was the result. Though Israel made no claim, the world assumed it was responsible. Albert Einstein is reputed to have said: 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.' Whatever Khamenei's thinking – perhaps he believed his first aerial assault on Israel had been under-powered – he opted for a second, bigger and more focused attempt. He decided to use some 200 advanced Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan missiles, and to target military and intelligence locations. In the event this second Iranian attack, launched on October 1, was only marginally more damaging than the first. Once again most missiles were intercepted by Israeli and US defense systems, including support from US naval vessels stationed nearby. How and when Israel would retaliate became the subject of intense media speculation. The theorizing was temporarily suspended when Iran’s prize collaborator, the head of Hamas, Yahyah Sinwar, was shot dead by the IDF on October 16. While welcoming the news as 'a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world,' US President Joe Biden made it clear that he did not want Israel to target Iran’s nuclear and oil installations for fear of triggering all-out war. When it came, Israel’s response, delivered on October 25, respected his wish and consisted of heavy air strikes on Iranian military targets in Syria and on Hezbollah’s military infrastructure. So Israel and Iran are undoubtedly in conflict, if not formally at war. Anyone who cares to look into the matter can see why no truce can be meaningful. The objective of the Iranian regime, from its foundation in 1979, has been to acquire as much power and influence as possible in order to achieve the key objectives laid down by the regime’s original Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He affirmed repeatedly that the very purpose of his revolution was to destroy Western-style democracy and its way of life, and to impose Shia Islam on the whole world. He identified the United States and Israel as his prime targets, but included what was then the USSR. 'We wish to cause the corrupt roots of Zionism, Capitalism and Communism to wither throughout the world,' said Khomeini. 'We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet.' By this he meant his strict Shia interpretation of Islam, for elsewhere he had declared that the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, situated in the heart of Sunni Saudi Arabia, were in the hands of 'a band of heretics'. These objectives have driven the regime ever since, and continue to be its raison d’être. 'We shall export our revolution to the whole world,' declared Khomeini. 'Until the cry 'There is no god but Allah' resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.' In short, Iran’s leaders want to destroy the world as we know it. They want to achieve political dominance in the Middle East, overthrow Western-style democracy of which America is the prime exponent, wipe out the state of Israel, and impose Shia Islam across the globe. Whether the West wishes to acknowledge it or not, in combatting Iran, Israel is fighting for the free world as a whole.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdMLHTWZQzrvG	2024-11-15T09:19:56-08:00	
Sri Lanka’s Leftist Party Exponentially Improves Its Electoral Pe...	In the Sri Lankan Presidential election held on September 21, the candidate of the leftist National Peoples Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake, just scraped through. But in the parliamentary elections held on November 14, his party, the NPP, romped home with a stunning two thirds majority. Sri Lanka's only major leftist party, the National Peoples' Power (NPP), is continuing its dream run in the island nation's electoral politics. It registered a stunning improvement in its electoral standing in the parliamentary elections held on November 14. The NPP secured 159 seats in the parliament of 224 members, which gives it a two-third majority. And it got 61.68% of the valid votes, while in the September 21 Presidential election, its successful candidate, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, got only 42.3% of the votes. An electoral pole vault was on display. After the Presidential election, it was said that if only the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa and the Independent candidate former President Ranil Wickremesinghe had patched up their differences and supported a single candidate, Dissanayake would have been defeated. Premadasa and Wickremesinghe were top leaders of the same party, the United National party (UNP) for decades before they broke up, virtually destroying the Grand Old Party. That argument may have held water in September, but not in November. The voting pattern in the November parliamentary elections showed that even a combination of Premadasa's SJB and Wickremesinghe's National Democratic Front (NDF) would have been no match to Dissanyake's NPP. NPP's Growing Appeal The NPP's appeal had grown exponentially in the past two months. It now covers disparate groups living in different parts of the island and belonging to different ethnic groups. President Dissanayake and his NPP are being seen by more and more people from diverse areas and in diverse communities as the most suitable leader to exercise power in Sri Lanka. Conventional (past) Sri Lankan Presidents and MPs had shown total unconcern for the plight of the common man, people say. They had amassed ill-gotten wealth using State power in total disregard of national economic and security interests. Previously, the NPP was thought to be a left wing representative of the majority Sinhalese, who are about 75% of the population. It seemed as if the NPP had no concern for the minority Tamils and Muslims. This was because the hard core of the NPP was the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which unabashedly and uncompromisingly stood for the Sinhalese' rights viv-a-vis the minorities. But after Anura Kumara Dissanayake became JVP's leader, the party came out of its ideological and communal confines and began to broaden its appeal from the Sinhalese urban working class to the middle and upper classes in all communities and both in the rural and urban areas. Dissanayake reached out to the Corporate sector and assured the entrepreneurs and managers that the NPP will not hinder their growth. This change of image enabled the NPP to make a quantum jump from three seats in the dissolved parliament to 159 seats in the new parliament. Catching up with Minorities A noteworthy aspect of the NPP this time round is that it had put up Tamil and Muslim candidates in the North and East of the island where these minority communities predominate. The NPP candidates here had beaten local Tamil and Muslim bigwigs, like M.A.Sumanthiran in Jaffna. The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the oldest and the largest Tamil party since 1949, got only one seat in Jaffna, the Tamil heartland. But the NPP bagged three there. In Trincomalee, the NPP got 2 seats, while the ITAK got only one. In Batticaloa, another Tamil bastion, the NPP got one seat while the ITAK got three. Party Composition in Parliament In the new parliament of 224 seats, the NPP will have 141 elected members and 18 nominated members (also called National List members). The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), will be second with 40 seats, out of which 35 will be elected members and five to be appointed via the National List. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) comes third after securing eight seats, from which seven are elected and one is a National List seat. The New Democratic Front (NDF) led by former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, will have five seats, out of which three are elected members and two are National List appointments. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led by the Rajapaksa family received only 350,429 votes but has managed to secure three seats out of which two (02) are elected. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), Sarvajana Balaya, and United National Party (UNP) have secured a few seats. Pros and Cons of Massive Mandate Sri Lankan voters are now discussing the pros and cons of giving the NPP a two thirds majority. Would it make parliament irrelevant, they ask. Parliamentary redundancy is a real possibility because in other countries, a two thirds majority had led to dictatorship. In the party system, MPs have to obey the party 'whip'. The leaders of the NPP, who are actually hard core members of the original JVP, could road roll party MPs to toe the party line which could be rigid. And under the Executive Presidential system that Sri Lanka has, the President is very powerful. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa used his Executive power fully to take unpopular decisions which ultimately led to a mass revolt (called the Aragalaya) that forced him to flee the country. President Dissanayake and the NPP had promised to do away with the Executive Presidency by enacting a totally new constitution. But there is very little chance of this happening. All past Presidents, from Chandrika Bandaranaike onwards, had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency, only to abandon the idea ultimately. Every President and ruling party had wanted to exercise the powers given to the Executive President by the constitution. Challenges Since 2019, Sri Lankans have been suffering from loss of income and jobs, and rising prices since the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic crisis which followed. Sri Lanka had defaulted on loans running into billions of dollars. The NPP has been promising to reduce economic distress. But it is not clear as to how it proposes to remedy the situation. It needs to root out corruption and inefficiency which is endemic. Politicisation of the bureaucracy and economic decision making has distorted the economy and the functioning of the system. This has to be rooted out by the NPP regime. The other equally worrying problem is the management of foreign powers, who, while extending a helping hand with funds and projects, also extract their pound of flesh in terms of economic and political concessions in pursuit of their national, strategic and geopolitical interests. Dissanayake would need expert help to meet his domestic and foreign policy challenges. He is likely to find the task of reconciling his left wing and nationalistic foreign policy predilections with ground realities and realpolitik. This is the reason why former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been repeatedly saying that voters much choose experienced people and that the Dissanayake government must draft experienced people to guide it when it navigates through treacherous waters both at home and overseas. Wickremesinghe has offered his services, being the most experienced in governance among the present crop of politicians. He has been President once and a Prime Minister more than once. Will Power Corrupt? While the NPP is lauded for its stunning performance, the people of Sri Lanka also are worried that absolute power might go to Dissanayake's head. They quote Lord Acton who said: 'Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' In the past, powerful leaders, whether in Sri Lanka or elsewhere, have not always acquitted themselves well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdGqHR2pT8OjE	2024-11-15T09:19:04-08:00	
Gen Z Workers: Values Matter, And So Does Financial Security	Despite appearances and tongue-wagging from older observers, it turns out that Gen Z is much more eager to work hard for both social good and long-term financial security than some might think, according to new research from the Ateneo de Manila University. Steeled by economic uncertainty leading up to—and most especially in the wake of—the COVID-19 pandemic, the youngest Filipinos now entering the workforce greatly value both a stable income and personal achievement. These idealistic yet pragmatic members of Gen Z (born between 1995 and 2012) tend to look for meaningful and fulfilling work environments but also willingly forego creature comforts in favor of long-term financial stability. In their seminal study of Filipino Gen Z employees, the Ateneo researchers uncovered clear distinctions in workplace motivation versus previous generations, particularly Millennials (or Gen Y, born between 1980 and 1994); Gen X (depending on the research agency, born in either 1961 or 1965, up to 1979); and Baby Boomers (born after World War II, in 1946 to 1960/1964). These differences reflect how the unique socioeconomic context of each generation influences their motivations and overall outlook. Family matters Filipino cultural expectations concerning familial responsibility play a unique role in Pinoy Gen Z employees' work decisions. Many in this cohort are motivated by the need to support their families financially—an intrinsic motivator in Filipino culture. For Gen Z Pinoys, contributing to family well-being is a main reason for why they seek competitive salaries and benefits that can support both themselves and their loved ones. 'Family is a significant motivator for their work, as they strive to provide a good life for their loved ones. Some participants (of the study) who are the eldest child also reported feeling a greater sense of responsibility to provide for their family,' the researchers noted. Personal achievement and career growth Moreover, Gen Z puts a premium on personal achievement in the form of career growth and skill development. This focus is reflected in their desire for rapid advancement and fulfillment in their roles. Meanwhile, Gen X, who typically value job security and stability over rapid career growth, are less likely to switch jobs for career advancement alone. Baby Boomers also have a strong sense of organizational loyalty—they often stay with one employer for extended periods—but are less driven by the desire for rapid career advancement. Also, while Gen Z and Millennials are both technologically savvy and open to flexible work arrangements, Gen Z has a preference for hybrid or flexible remote work as they value autonomy and balance. In contrast, Millennials, who largely came of age during the rapid expansion of digital workplaces, are more accustomed to structured team-based settings and in-person collaboration. 'Compared to Millennials, who put more value on interesting work and collegial work environments, Gen Zs tend to focus on securing their future through savings and investments,' the researchers said. On a personal level, Gen Z’s emphasis on meaningful work also differs from other generations. Many Gen Z employees are motivated by work that aligns with their passions and allows them to make a positive impact on others and on society at large. This is partly driven by their experience of growing up in a digitally-connected world, where social issues and values-driven missions are increasingly visible and influential. Millennials, who came of age just as the digital world was emerging, also share some of this values-driven focus and likewise seek out work environments that foster a sense of community and purpose. However, Baby Boomers and Gen X tend to prioritize job security and are generally less motivated by the need for their work to align with personal or social values. What employers should know All of these generational differences suggest that companies aiming to retain Gen Z employees should focus on fostering career growth; aligning organizational values with broader social impact; and providing robust financial benefits that cater both to immediate needs and long-term security. Otherwise, companies that rely solely on traditional job security and loyalty strategies might find themselves less effective in engaging and retaining this youngest cohort of employees. Overall, Gen Z’s workplace motivations combine financial pragmatism, personal achievement, and values-driven work in a way that distinctly sets them apart from older generations. 'Financial security is one of Gen Z’s motivating factors, as they view work as an avenue for them to earn and save money for their future. Even though Millennials put a premium on compensation, the Gen Z respondents are more specific as to how they want to use their salary,' the Ateneo researchers explained. 'They also want their work to have an impact on others and society. They want to see how their work contributes to the organization’s mission in general,' they added. Mikee C. Talamayan, Dr. Mendiola Teng-Calleja, and Dr. Jaimee Felice Caringal-Go of the Ateneo de Manila University Department of Psychology and the Ateneo Center for Organization Research and Development published their paper, 'Motivating Filipino Generation Z employees at work: enablers and outcomes,' in the journal Evidence-based HRM in October 2024.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdM7LdlTCiexP	2024-11-15T09:16:37-08:00	
The Evolution Of International Political Sociology (IPS): An Expl...	International Political Sociology (IPS) stands as an interdisciplinary field at the crossroads of international relations (IR), sociology, and political theory. Rooted in the critique of traditional IR paradigms, IPS seeks to bridge gaps between domestic, transnational, and global dynamics, focusing on how social processes shape and are shaped by politics at multiple levels. This article traces the evolution of IPS through nine pivotal theories that have significantly influenced its development. 1. Realism and Its Sociological Limitations Realism, particularly dominant during the mid-20th century, is often seen as a precursor to IPS because of the challenges it inadvertently posed for sociological inquiry. Rooted in the belief that international politics operates in an anarchic system where states pursue power and security, realism largely ignored social forces and non-state actors. While classical realists such as Hans Morgenthau acknowledged human nature's role, structural realists like Kenneth Waltz focused solely on systemic constraints. The sociological critique emerged from this omission, questioning how domestic social structures, cultural contexts, and transnational relationships inform state behavior. IPS grew partly as a reaction to realism's narrow focus, seeking to incorporate broader societal forces into its analysis. 2. Liberalism and the Role of Transnational Actors Liberalism countered realism by emphasizing the role of cooperation, international institutions, and non-state actors in fostering global peace. The liberal theory introduced the concept of transnational networks, including corporations, NGOs, and epistemic communities, which influenced global governance and policy-making. IPS drew from liberalism by highlighting how social interactions among these actors create norms, identities, and practices that transcend borders. The sociological turn in liberal thought underscored the role of individuals and collective actors in shaping political outcomes, a cornerstone of IPS. 3. Constructivism: The Social Fabric of International Politics Constructivism, championed by scholars like Alexander Wendt, marked a significant shift by emphasizing the socially constructed nature of international politics. Unlike realism and liberalism, which viewed the international system as a given, constructivism argued that state interests, identities, and norms are products of social interactions. IPS expanded on constructivist insights, delving deeper into how power and discourse shape these interactions. The field investigates not only the construction of state identities but also how global hierarchies and local practices intersect, producing complex political and social outcomes. 4. Postcolonial Theory: Unearthing Power Dynamics Postcolonial theory challenges Eurocentric narratives in international relations by foregrounding the histories and experiences of colonized peoples. Thinkers like Edward Said and Gayatri Spivak revealed how colonial legacies persist in contemporary global politics through power imbalances and cultural domination. IPS integrates postcolonial insights to explore how global inequalities are reproduced and resisted. By examining issues such as migration, border politics, and racialized hierarchies, IPS emphasizes the role of marginalized voices in reshaping international politics. 5. Feminist Theory: Gendering Global Politics Feminist theory introduced a critical lens to understand how gender shapes international relations. Scholars like Cynthia Enloe highlighted the often-overlooked contributions of women in global politics, from their roles in war economies to their activism in peace movements. IPS builds on feminist critiques by analyzing how gender intersects with race, class, and nationality in global contexts. The focus on micro-level practices, such as the everyday lives of migrants or the gendered impacts of security policies, reflects the field's commitment to nuanced, intersectional analysis. 6. Foucauldian Perspectives: Power, Discourse, and Governance Michel Foucault's theories of power and discourse profoundly influenced IPS. Foucault shifted the focus from state-centric power to the diffuse, everyday practices through which power operates. His concept of 'governmentality' — the art of governing beyond the state — provided a framework for understanding global governance as a network of practices involving states, institutions, and individuals. In IPS, Foucauldian approaches examine how security, development, and migration policies are shaped by specific discourses and practices. For instance, the securitization of borders reflects not just state interests but broader societal anxieties and normative frameworks. 7. Theories of Globalization: Interconnected Realities The rise of globalization theories in the late 20th century offered new ways to conceptualize the interconnectedness of the world. Scholars like Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells examined how technological advancements, economic integration, and cultural exchanges reshape social and political life. IPS incorporates globalization theories to study how local and global processes interact. For example, it explores how global financial markets influence domestic policies or how diasporic communities maintain transnational ties while navigating local identities. 8. Critical Security Studies: Rethinking Security Critical security studies (CSS) emerged as a direct challenge to traditional security paradigms that prioritized state-centric, military-focused approaches. Drawing from constructivist and poststructuralist insights, CSS redefines security as a social construct, encompassing issues like human security, environmental threats, and cybersecurity. IPS aligns closely with CSS, emphasizing the role of societal actors in defining and contesting security policies. By examining how security discourses shape identities and practices, IPS reveals the underlying power dynamics in seemingly neutral policies. 9. The Anthropological Turn: Everyday Practices in Global Politics The anthropological turn in IPS focuses on the micro-level practices that constitute global politics. Drawing from ethnography and cultural anthropology, this approach examines how ordinary people experience and influence international phenomena, such as migration, trade, or conflict. This perspective challenges top-down analyses by highlighting the agency of marginalized groups and the significance of local knowledge. For instance, studying refugee communities' coping mechanisms reveals how global migration policies are negotiated and resisted on the ground. Conclusion International Political Sociology represents a dynamic field that bridges the theoretical and practical, the global and local, and the structural and individual. Its evolution reflects a growing recognition of the complexity of international relations and the inadequacy of traditional paradigms in capturing this complexity. By integrating insights from realism, liberalism, constructivism, postcolonial and feminist theories, Foucauldian perspectives, globalization studies, critical security studies, and anthropology, IPS offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the social dimensions of global politics. As the field continues to grow, it remains committed to interrogating power, amplifying marginalized voices, and fostering interdisciplinary dialogue. The theories discussed here underscore IPS's central premise: that the political is inherently social, and the global cannot be understood without the local.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdGR-gT2ZIAJz	2024-11-15T09:15:31-08:00	
How Anthropological Theories Shaped International Relations: An E...	Anthropology, as the study of human cultures, societies, and behaviors, has significantly influenced the field of International Relations (IR). It has offered unique perspectives on understanding global politics, power dynamics, and the role of human agency in shaping international systems. This article delves into some of the prominent anthropological theories and their profound contributions to IR, illustrating the interdisciplinary synergy that has enriched the study of global affairs. 1. Structural Functionalism Developed by scholars like Émile Durkheim and Bronisław Malinowski, structural functionalism examines how societal structures serve specific functions to maintain social order. In IR, this theory underscores how institutions, norms, and rituals stabilize international systems. For example, international organizations such as the United Nations or World Trade Organization can be analyzed through this lens. Just as kinship systems maintain cohesion in traditional societies, these global institutions mediate conflict, distribute resources, and establish norms for cooperation. Structural functionalism also explains the persistence of cultural practices and their impact on diplomacy. Rituals and ceremonies in statecraft, such as summits or treaty signings, serve functional purposes by reinforcing trust and shared values among nations. By highlighting the importance of systemic interdependence, this theory provides IR scholars with a framework to understand how global structures operate cohesively despite underlying conflicts. 2. Cultural Relativism Franz Boas's principle of cultural relativism emphasizes understanding societies on their own terms, free from ethnocentric judgments. In IR, this theory challenges Western-centric perspectives, advocating for a nuanced understanding of non-Western states and cultures. For example, during negotiations or conflict resolution, cultural relativism encourages policymakers to consider diverse worldviews. The Westphalian model of sovereignty may not resonate with societies that prioritize communal over individual rights. Similarly, concepts like democracy and human rights must be contextualized within local traditions and histories. Incorporating cultural relativism into IR fosters more equitable global governance by avoiding the imposition of universal norms that might disregard cultural specificities. It also informs ethical foreign policies, ensuring respect for the diversity of global political systems and cultural practices. 3. Symbolic Anthropology Pioneered by Clifford Geertz, symbolic anthropology explores how symbols and rituals shape meaning within cultures. This theory has influenced IR by shedding light on the symbolic dimensions of diplomacy, statecraft, and international norms. For example, national flags, anthems, and state ceremonies serve as powerful symbols that reinforce identity and unity. In IR, these symbols play crucial roles during negotiations and conflicts. The waving of a white flag as a symbol of truce or the use of olive branches in diplomacy underscores the importance of shared meanings in mediating international relations. By analyzing these symbolic practices, IR scholars gain insights into how states construct and communicate their identities on the global stage. Symbolic anthropology thus enriches the understanding of how culture shapes international interactions. 4. Structuralism Claude Lévi-Strauss's structuralism focuses on the deep, underlying structures of human thought that shape cultural practices. In IR, this theory highlights how binary oppositions like 'us vs. them' or 'friend vs. foe' structure international politics. Structuralism provides a lens to understand how narratives of identity and difference underpin global conflicts and alliances. For instance, the Cold War was not just a geopolitical rivalry but also a clash of ideological binaries: capitalism vs. communism. Similarly, global anti-terrorism policies often rely on constructing oppositions between 'civilized' and 'uncivilized' actors. By unpacking these binaries, IR scholars can critique the assumptions underlying policies and identify paths toward more inclusive global frameworks. 5. Post-Structuralism Post-structuralism, influenced by Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, deconstructs the assumptions and power dynamics embedded in social and political systems. In IR, this theory challenges dominant narratives and explores the construction of power and knowledge. For example, post-structuralism interrogates how terms like 'terrorism' or 'rogue state' are constructed and deployed to justify military interventions. It also critiques the universalizing tendencies of global governance, revealing how they often privilege Western ideologies. By emphasizing the fluidity of meaning and the role of discourse, post-structuralism empowers IR scholars to rethink rigid frameworks and embrace alternative perspectives on global issues. 6. Political Ecology Political ecology examines the relationships between environmental issues, political systems, and social structures. In IR, this theory has become increasingly relevant in addressing global challenges like climate change, resource conflicts, and environmental justice. For instance, political ecology highlights how resource scarcity can exacerbate tensions between states or within regions, as seen in water disputes along the Nile River. It also critiques global environmental policies that marginalize indigenous communities or perpetuate colonial legacies. By linking ecological concerns with power dynamics, political ecology broadens IR's scope, emphasizing the need for sustainable and inclusive global governance. 7. The Gift Theory Marcel Mauss's theory of the gift explores the obligations of giving, receiving, and reciprocating in social relationships. This concept has been adapted in IR to analyze foreign aid, economic diplomacy, and alliance-building. Foreign aid, for instance, is not purely altruistic but often involves expectations of political or economic returns. The theory of the gift reveals how these exchanges reinforce hierarchical relationships between donor and recipient states, shaping global power dynamics. By unpacking the symbolic and material dimensions of exchange, this theory provides valuable insights into the complexities of international economic relations. 8. Interpretive Anthropology Interpretive anthropology, associated with Clifford Geertz, emphasizes understanding cultures through the meanings people assign to their actions. In IR, this theory informs the study of international norms, values, and practices. For example, the concept of sovereignty varies widely across cultures. Interpretive anthropology allows IR scholars to analyze how different societies interpret and implement this principle. It also aids in understanding the cultural dimensions of global conflicts, such as the role of religion or tradition in shaping political movements. This theory enriches IR by highlighting the importance of meaning-making in global politics, fostering deeper cross-cultural understanding. 9. World Systems Theory Immanuel Wallerstein's world systems theory examines the global economy as a hierarchical system comprising core, semi-periphery, and periphery nations. While rooted in sociology, this theory draws heavily on anthropological insights into labor, production, and cultural exchange. In IR, world systems theory critiques the inequalities inherent in global capitalism. It highlights how peripheral nations are often exploited for their resources and labor, perpetuating economic dependence on core nations. This perspective informs debates on globalization, development, and postcolonialism. By emphasizing structural inequalities, world systems theory offers a critical lens for analyzing global economic and political relations. 10. Agency and Structure Debate The agency-structure debate in anthropology explores the interplay between individual actions and systemic forces. This debate has influenced IR by highlighting the role of human agency in shaping international systems. For instance, while global structures like capitalism or diplomacy constrain states, individual leaders and social movements often challenge or reshape these systems. The Arab Spring exemplifies how collective agency can disrupt entrenched political orders. By integrating agency into IR analysis, this theory emphasizes the potential for change and innovation in global politics, challenging deterministic frameworks. 11. Ethnographic Methodology in IR Ethnography, the hallmark of anthropology, has enriched IR by providing tools for in-depth, qualitative analysis of international phenomena. Through participant observation and fieldwork, ethnography uncovers the lived experiences of individuals affected by global policies. For example, ethnographic studies of refugee camps reveal how international aid policies are implemented on the ground, often highlighting discrepancies between policy intentions and outcomes. Similarly, ethnographic research on diplomatic practices sheds light on the informal dynamics that shape international negotiations. By centering human experiences, ethnography bridges the gap between abstract theories and real-world practices, making IR more grounded and inclusive. Conclusion The intersection of anthropology and international relations has fostered a richer understanding of global politics by emphasizing culture, meaning, and human agency. The theories discussed here — from structural functionalism to ethnography — illustrate how anthropological insights challenge dominant paradigms, uncover hidden power dynamics, and offer alternative frameworks for addressing global challenges. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the integration of anthropology into IR will remain vital for fostering cross-cultural understanding, promoting equity, and navigating the complexities of global governance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdMaaIZUMRPZz	2024-11-15T09:13:33-08:00	
Pentagon Will Work Quickly To Meet President Biden’s ‘Surge’ Comm...	By C. Todd Lopez In September, President Joe Biden announced he plans to 'surge' security assistance to Ukraine. That surge includes plans to ensure all remaining congressionally authorized funding to support Ukraine, including $5.5 billion in presidential drawdown authority, should be transferred to Ukraine before the administration closes out activities in January. Executing that presidential drawdown authority, which means moving some $5.5 billion in gear from U.S. military inventory to Ukraine before Jan. 20, is a tall order. But Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the Defense Department has demonstrated a remarkable ability to quickly get things done over the past three years. 'It is a short time … just under 70 days,' Singh said during a briefing today. 'This department can do incredible work in that amount of time. The president made clear that … he wants to spend down the authority that Congress has allocated and authorized before he leaves office. We're going to work very hard to make sure that happens.' Since Russia illegally invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has provided about $60.4 billion in security assistance. On Nov. 1, for instance, the department initiated the 69th presidential drawdown authority package to Ukraine, worth some $425 million. 'I expect that for the next coming months of this administration, you're going to continue to see those packages draw down from ... what's available in our stockpiles,' Singh said. 'Again, we're committed to ensuring that Ukraine has what it needs to be successful on the battlefield.' Singh also said that the department has been, since the first transfer of military hardware to Ukraine though PDA, cognizant of what's being sent and of what the department needs for itself to ensure that readiness is maintained. That's something that's not going to change, she said. 'We're constantly refilling our shelves and our stockpiles,' she said. 'The secretary is not going to allow the department to dip below readiness levels that he doesn't feel comfortable with. So, as we continue to refill our own shelves, you're going to see equipment, capabilities continue to flow out.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFowK7vNfNby	2024-11-15T09:11:23-08:00	
Bangladesh’s Impending Descent Into Islamist Republic – OpEd	Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus's interim administration apparently plans to turn Bangladesh into an Islamist Republic. The country's Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman has said that the word 'secular' should be removed from the nation's Constitution since '90% of the population is Muslim'. Asaduzzaman came up with this argument during a court hearing on the legality of the 15th Amendment, which was passed during the ousted Awami League's tenure in power and which guarantees Bangladeshis freedom to practise their religions. That amendment partly did not undo the status of Islam as state religion enforced in 1988 during the military rule of General H M Ershad, who was later ousted by a popular agitation, but it gave religious minorities freedom to practise their religion. 'Earlier, there was constant trust and faith in Allah. I want it the way it was before. It is said in Article 2A that the state shall ensure equal rights and equality in the practice of all religions. Article 9 talks about 'Bengali nationalism'. It is contradictory,' Asaduzzaman argued during the court hearing. Since he is the chief law officer of the interim government, his pitch in court would not be possible without green light from chief advisor Muhammed Yunus, whose liberal image abroad is clearly in contradiction to ground realities in Bangladesh since the ouster of the Awami League government. Pogroms Against Hindus, Buddhists Someone in Bangladesh claiming to be an 'Islamic Joddha' (Islamic Fighter) forwarded a Facebook post by Islamic Chatra Shibir (student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami) that claimed killing seven Hindus in the recent violence rocking the country's port city of Chittagong last week. The post claims, 'teaching Hindus in Chittagong the lesson they deserved because they had become too bold.' It also called on all to support our 'Muslim army' which, it says, has got 200 Hindus arrested to be 'taught the right lesson.' The attacks on a Hindu locality in Chittagong followed protests by Hindus in the city over a Facebook post by a local Muslim youth seeking a ban on ISKCON. During the protests, police and army mercilessly attacked Hindus, alleged local community leaders. Buddhist tribespeople in the Chittagong Hill Tracts faced similar attacks during a military crackdown following some clashes between them and Muslim settlers last month. A few tribespeople were killed during what community leaders described as 'unprovoked firings.' Indian, US reactions India has strongly urged Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Mohammed Yunus to take steps to stop violence against Hindus and other minorities. 'We have observed that there have been attacks on the Hindu community in Chittagong. Their properties have been looted, their business establishments have been looted. These happened following incendiary posts on social media targeting Hindu religious organisations,' MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. Interestingly just before he won the US Presidential Election, Donald Trump lashed out at growing violence against minorities in Bangladesh. 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump's choice to head National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has also lashed out at 'atrocities against Hindus and other religious minorities in Bangladesh.' In a video of hers widely circulating in the social media, Gabbard described these atrocities as 'a continuation of the atrocities perpetrated by the Pakistani rulers.' Gabbard is a practicing Hindu known for her close relations with India's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Yunus administration has so far dismissed Indian concerns over growing attacks on minorities as 'highly exaggerated,' but with Trump all set to take charge, it can no longer be in self denial over the total lawlessness and anarchy prevailing in Bangladesh. Yunus promised rule of law when he took charge of the interim administration, for which there is no provision in the Bangladesh constitution, but which was apparently justified by the 'Doctrine of Necessity' that has often been used to justify military takeovers in Pakistan. Bangladesh's Growing Mobocracy Since the installation of the interim government and the dissolution of the parliament which the erstwhile Awami League has described as 'illegal', a culture of mobocracy seems to have taken root. All high level functionaries who could not be ousted legally, have been forced to resign by mobs led by student leaders who brought down the government of Sheikh Hasina. All Vice Chacellors, Pro-VCs, even Treasurers in 50 universities of the country have been forced to resign by violent mobs led by the student leaders who have owned up to close links to radical groups like the Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Islami Chatra Shibir. According to media reports, 175 School Headmasters have been forced to resign. Many of them were Hindus and quite a few of them were women. The mobs subjected them to visible humiliation. All Supreme Court judges and many High Court judges including the Chief Justice and Attorney General were forcibly removed by similar mob action, as well as ⁠33 permanent secretaries and 11 ambassdors have bern arbitrarily removed, much before end of their tenure. ⁠Nearly 300 secretaries and Additional secretaries and many more Joint Secretaries, a few hundred police commissioners downward, and Joint secretaries have been appointed without any due process. There has been a wholesale reshuffle in banks and other top financial institutions, mostly on an arbitrary basis. Most of those ousted were seen as close to the Awami League and many of those now installed are known to be close to Islamist radical groups. NHRC resignations Last week, all members of Bangladesh's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) resigned shortly after releasing a report on rising mob violence. The NHRC, chaired by Kamal Uddin Ahmed, along with members Md Salim Reza, Aminul Islam, Kongjari Chowdhury, Biswajit Chanda, and Tania Haque, submitted resignation letters to the president. The NHRC resignations came just days after the release of a report detailing a sharp rise in mob violence and crimes such as beatings, rapes, and political harassment in October. The report also exposed violent attacks on political figures, contributing to growing concerns about human rights and safety in Bangladesh. The NHRC spokesperson, Yusha Rahman, confirmed the resignations but could not specify the underlying cause. The political and communal unrest intensified following Hasina's exit, worsening the nation's human rights scenario. The NHRC's report, which underscored these escalating crimes and unrest, appears to have amplified the gravity of the situation, possibly prompting the commission members to step down. The increasing violence and political instability continue to shape the national landscape, posing significant challenges for the interim government. Ridiculous Cases Yunus' promised Rule of Law has been characterised by pursuit of vendetta as state policy. Nearly 200 cases, mostly with charges of murder, have been filed involving over 200,000 Awami Leaders and activists. Some of them, like the murder case against top cricket icon Shakib Al Hasan and lawyer Z.I Khan Panna, are downright frivolous. Shakib, an Awami League lawmaker, was away playing cricket in Canada at the time of the crackdown on student protestors when the murder he is accused of happened. Panna supported the student protests but fell foul with them for criticising their subsequent conduct after establishment of the Interim government. The height of irony is thst the complainant in the murder case accusing Panna does not know the lawyer and has gone on record to say so. The whole idea is to harass, intimidate and humiliate anyone opposing the mobocracy. Media censorship is enforced by a culture of terror and threat and many journalists and editors have been framed in cases with murder charges. Already, even leading western publications like 'Time' are suggesting a change of national mood with many saying 'Hasina's times were much better.' Owner of two small shops, Hasina Jahan pandered to this feeling with her own story. 'During Hasina's rule, we paid a monthly subscription of few hundred rupees a month to her partymen. Now both my shops have been looted and I am ruined. I am surviving by giving tuition to school students and my sister is making a few bucks by escorting toddlers from well-off families to school,' Hasina told the Federal. 'We don't judge rulers by their politics but by our own experience. See the uncontrollable price rise now,' she stressed to point to Yunus' biggest failure -- control the price of essential commodities like foodstuff. The student leaders and the Islamist radical groups they hail from have periodically taken to the streets to demand resignation of President Shahabuddin Chuppu. Some of them have even called for removal of army chief General Waqar-u-Zaman. Recently one of the newly appointed advisor Mahfuz Alam pulled down the portrait of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from Banga Bhavan, seat of the Bangladesh presidency. Alam, described as the 'mastermind' of the agitation that led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, has been a hardliner from the radical Islamist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir. He was first inducted as Yunus' personal assistant and then upgraded to a full fledged advisor. But now the student leaders appear to be upset with some of the newly appointed advisors like film Director Mostafa Sarwar Farooqi whose wife Tisha acted in the Mujibur Rahman biopic. Finally the contradictions within the Interim government is beginning to surface. Army to get more powers Amidst the raging chaos, it is reliably learnt that the 'magistracy powers' given to the Army for two months will be extended. Even the borderguards and coastguards will now be given these powers. This enables the military and paramilitary units to arrest anybody on mere suspicion of their involvement with efforts to disturb law and order. Analysts see this as an attempt by Yunus and his coterie to stay in power by avoiding early elections, which has been demanded by the country's leading political parties, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the ousted Awami League. The BNP, which was initially pleased with the Awami League's ouster, has now threatened to hit streets unless elections are announced. The Awami League has already resumed agitations for 'restoration of democracy.' The interim government clearly cannot manage to handle the street agitation of the top parties without the brazen use of the military and paramilitary forces, which are crucial to back up the Islamist radicals under cover of student mobs for the battle of the streets in Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdIfjrwjYW0C_	2024-11-15T09:09:06-08:00	
Jammu And Kashmir: Countering Pakistan’s Disinformation Campaign ...	Pakistan’s Social Media Kashmir Blitz It’s no secret that Pakistan relies heavily on indiscriminate use of social media to not only peddle its pathetic Kashmir narrative but also beguile local youth into picking up guns for waging Rawalpindi’s proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir [J&K]. What’s rather surprising is that New Delhi seldom draws attention of the international community to this concerted disinformation campaign being masterminded by Pakistan army’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI]. One of India’s leading English daily recently carried an illuminating article on this subject, in which it's mentioned that when compared with the same period last year, the more than 2,000 ‘posts of concern’ flagged during October-November, translates into more than a 22 percentage increase. Quoting 'a senior officer in the central security establishment,' the report mentions that there was a concerted effort by Pakistan to use social media to 'influence and exploit' impressionable minds and radicalise them for anti-national activities. This is indeed very disturbing news. New Delhi’s Response The newspaper report ibid merits deliberation for two reasons. Firstly, inclusion of factual data collated by security and intelligence agencies not only adds authenticity to the piece but also reveals the enormity of Pakistan’s sinister psychological warfare programme. Secondly, whereas the specific information provided has definitely been shared by those in the know with the author, the sources haven’t been named, which indicates that the powers-that-be are for reasons unknown, reluctant to make an official disclosure on this serious issue. Though allowing Islamabad to get away with its falsehood on Kashmir appears inexplicable, New Delhi certainly must be having good reasons for its reticence on this issue. For one, trying to rebut patently absurd claims and untenable contentions doesn’t make good diplomatic sense and only gives the balderdash an additional lease of life. Two, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry has a proclivity of shooting itself in the foot and as such giving it a long rope by keeping silent is in itself a good strategy. Remember Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi admitting on TV that abrogation of Article 370 was India’s 'internal matter'? Or Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari publicly accepting that 'We face a particularly uphill task to try and get Kashmir onto the centre of the agenda at the United Nations'? And by telling his countrymen that 'You should not live-in [a] fool’s paradise' as 'Nobody will be standing there [at UNSC] with garlands in hands,' didn’t Qureshi univocally acknowledge that Islamabad’s massive anti-Article 370 abrogation diplomatic offensive had no substance whatsoever? Necessity of Counter Action Islamabad's bombast on the Kashmir issue may be ignored, but its efforts to beguile Kashmiri youth into joining terrorist ranks definitely needs to be countered through a comprehensive campaign aimed at increasing awareness that exposes Pakistan’s menacing game-plan in J&K. Today’s generation in Kashmir is largely unaware of how for more than three-and-a-half decades their people have been used as cannon-fodder by Pakistan just to further its self-serving interests. Islamabad’s perfidy needs to be called out in order to save local youth of impressionable age from getting lured into terrorism, and this can best be done by citing facts revealed by those responsible for promoting this senseless violence. Reality Check Unlike Islamabad which has no other choice but to rely on disinformation for luring Kashmiri youth into terrorism, all that New Delhi has to do is to educate them of Pakistani perfidy by drawing their attention to true instances that unambiguously expose its double dealings. A few examples: Objective of 'Armed Struggle' Kashmiri youth need to realise that the actual objective of the so-called 'armed struggle' in J&K is not achieving 'azadi' [freedom] but solely for the purpose of bleeding India ‘through a thousand cuts’. They should be aware that Pakistan’s ex President and former army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf has himself admitted this during a TV interview by stating that '... Kashmiris who came to Pakistan received hero reception here. We used to train them and support them. We considered them as Mujahideen who will fight with the Indian Army...' [Emphasis added]. HM chief Syed Salahuddin who also heads the United Jihad Council, an umbrella organisation created by ISI to coordinate the activities of terrorist groups fighting and calls upon young Kashmiris to pick up the gun has endorsed Gen Musharraf’s revelation that the so-called 'armed struggle' has nothing to do with azadi as 'we are fighting Pakistan’s war in Kashmir.' With both the former Pakistan army chief who oversaw terrorist activities in J&K as well ISI's minion Salahuddin who's responsible for conducting terrorist actions in this region admitting that the aim of its so-called 'armed struggle' in Kashmir is solely to wage a proxy war against India, Kashmiri youth need to more careful and not end up being fooled into being used as pawns by Rawalpindi. Assassinations The youth should be reminded that ISI is responsible for assassinating those Kashmiri leaders who opposed Pakistan’s interference in Kashmir. This is evident from former All Parties Hurriyat Conference [APHC] chairman Prof Abdul Ghani Bhat’s 2011 revelation that J&K Peoples Conference chairman Abdul Ghani Lone, All J&K Awami Action Committee chairman Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammad Farooq and J&K Liberation Front [JKLF] ideologue Prof Abdul Ahad Wani 'were not killed by the army or the police-they were targeted by our own people.' Even Pakistan based JKLF founder Amanullah Khan has gone on record admitting that the ISI created HM terrorist group espousing Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan had killed more JKLF officials than Indian security forces. In an interview given to Arif Jamal, author of a seminal book on terrorism in J&K [Shadow War: The Untold Story of Jihad in Kashmir] Rawalpindi based HM commander Ajmal Khan claimed that his outfit had eliminated 'about 7,000 political rivals [mainly JKLF cadres]'. However, Masood Sarfraz, a former close confidante of Salahuddin maintains that 'the actual number [of Kashmiris killed by HM] is many times higher.' Pro Pakistan Camp’s Doublespeak The defining feature of the ISI sponsored political as well as military campaign in Kashmir is that while both APHC leaders and terrorist commanders demand others to make sacrifices, they themselves conveniently keep their own kith and kin out of harm’s way. For example, though senior APHC leader SAS Geelani maintained that'We [APHC] never denied or ignored the role of gun[s] in our struggle,' he ironically never made any of his sons join any terrorist group. Instead, in 2016, Geelani’s grandson suddenly landed a cushy government job as research officer in Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre in a gazetted grade equivalent position that had been lying vacant since 2005. There is strong evidence to suggest that the then Mehbooba Mufti government offered Geelani’s grandson this job as a quid pro quo for the APHC patriarch’s indulgence in stopping the violence that erupted after HM commander Buran Wani’s killing in an encounter. Such underhand deals are not uncommon and even HM chiefSalahuddin reportedly got a seat in a medical college for his son in a similar sweetheart deal brokered by J&K's Intelligence Bureau [IB] chief and approved by the then Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah! Salahuddin proudly accepts motivating Kashmiri youth into picking up the gun by assuring each aspirant that by doing 'he would get into the real life after this death and he would get peace. Khuda usse raazi hoga' [Allah would be pleased with him]. However, isn't it strange that the HM chief has cleverly ensured that his own sons don’t get a chance to get into 'real life' after death and earn divine blessings? Rather than picking up the gun, two of his sons had instead taken up jobs and served the same government that Salahuddin so vehemently accuses of strengthening what he perceives is New Delhi’s ‘forcible occupation’ of J&K! Additional Issues There’s no dearth of live examples that explicitly prove that despite all its emotional rhetoric, Pakistan has no love lost for the people of Kashmir. How does the recent targeted killing spate of migrant workers and grenade attack on innocent civilians in a local flea market by ISI sponsored terrorists further the so-called ‘Kashmir cause’ defies comprehension. This unsettling case in point leaves no scope for any doubts that other than creating mayhem and a heightened sense of insecurity amongst locals and tourists, such violence achieves nothing else. If such aimless violence continues, it will certainly dissuade tourists from coming to Kashmir and this in turn will adversely impact thousands of locals dependent on the tourism industry. The moot point is that if Pakistan really cares for the wellbeing of Kashmiris as it so vociferously claims, then would it precipitate conditions that deprive locals of their livelihood and order grenade attacks on Kashmiris? So, it's abundantly clear that for Islamabad, creating an illusion to buttress its ludicrous claim that normalcy eludes J&K is more important than the safety and wellbeing of Kashmiris. Adolf Hitler’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels had rightly opined that 'If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it,' and that’s why New Delhi cannot afford to be complacent. Pakistan is waging a multi-dimensional proxy war against India and as such every move that it makes needs to be appropriately addressed and befittingly replied to.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFSImCsqq4-8	2024-11-15T09:08:03-08:00	
President-Elect Donald Trump And Quandary Over The Russia-Ukraine...	Amid the uncertainties surrounding the incoming Donald Trump administration's likely position and role in the Russia-Ukraine war, Moscow has escalated its war efforts and launched missiles on Kyiv on November 13 - its first missile attack on the Ukrainian capital since August. In response, Ukraine has received temporary solace in the US Secretary of State Blinken's pledges that the 'Biden government will do what it can for Ukraine before leaving office.' With Trump's second term as president in US at the beginning of coming year, uncertainties spiral as to which direction more than three years of Ukrainian resistance and fight against the Russian territorial incursion would take. While President-elect Trump has made it clear he is going to end the war in just one day, it has generated anxiety and debate as to how he is going to accomplish this. He has asserted that the US has no appetite to remain entangled in the wars in distant places where the country does not perceive any direct interest being served. Trump does not want to uphold the international liberal order underlining American exceptionalism either. His transactional worldview suggests that there are no deep ideological divisions in the world as many would like to pit the liberal values upheld by the US against the convergence of authoritarian values championed by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. During his campaign trail, he not only stressed his previous tenure being successful in its diplomatic manoeuvres by managing the great power relations without getting the US entangled in wars but emphasized the way it could successfully fight against the ISIS as well. Ukraine and Russia would Prefer Negotiations to War Ukraine being a small power compared with Russia has been holding off Russian invasion by putting up stiff resistance with its will power and military as well as financial assistance from Europe and the US. It has also enhanced its indigenous capability of producing more weapons. However, external assistance has plateaued even as it needs far more arms and ammunitions to fortify its frontline. While the Western powers have instilled in Ukraine the hope that it can get back its lost territories and restore its 1991 borders, their assistance was not up to the level and proportion that could overpower Russia. The NATO moved cautiously so as not to cross the Russian redlines and allow Ukraine to use long range missiles that could target any part of Russian territory let alone grant membership to it. Meanwhile, Ukraine entered into bilateral security agreements with certain European countries but that is not enough to assure Ukraine of protecting its territories against Russian creeping invasion. In the absence of negotiations tilting in favour of it, Ukraine was not replenished with sufficient military assistance and not allowed to muster enough military muscle to turn the tide of war decisively in its favour. While Russia received fighters from North Korea to maintain its predominance, Ukraine could not receive men in boot from its supporters despite the dire need of them. It has not been able to fortify its defences against the Russian forces within its territory losing ground to the latter. To recover these territories from Russian control, Ukraine would need massive western assistance. Ukrainians would never like to see losing these territories to Russia. Any negotiation that Ukraine enters into from a position of weakness would allow Russia to redraw its map by formally including these territories to its existing boundaries. On the other side, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky whose popularity is gradually dwindling can escape a change of regime by defending these territories from Russian occupation. In the hope of greater and steady assistance from these powers and to demonstrate Russia that the game was going to be a tough one, Ukraine, for the first time, made an incursion into the Russian territory and occupied parts of Kursk region. Now, perceiving the Ukrainian hopes destined to get faded soon, Russia has upped the ante by escalating the war. Both Ukraine and Russia although have been worn out in the protracted war, they will want a negotiated settlement but will never want to be perceived to be in the losing side by their people following the loss of so many lives from their armed forces including mercenaries and conscripted soldiers and civilians. Russian President Vladimir Putin's stated objectives of demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine while remain opaque in their definitions, Russia can demonstrate victory to its people by formally annexing the Ukrainian territories it has occupied over these three years of war. On the negotiating table, it would want guarantees that Ukraine would not be a part of NATO and the military pact would stop eastward expansion by withdrawing all kinds of military activities around and assistance from Ukraine. President-elect Trump would use different tactics to bring Russia to the negotiating table to end the protracted war given his transactional world views. Apparently, he shares good equations with President Putin but Moscow has viewed his electoral victory tepidly. Trump reportedly said unless Russia comes to a negotiating position, Ukraine would be armed to teeth to force it to compromise. War Gravitates Towards Negotiations But Without Blueprint The US under the Biden administration and the European countries have so far refrained from devising and offering any viable plans to end the war through negotiations. These powers as well as Russia and its informal allies continue to buttress their positions in the war without any plans for 'the day after'. Although some neutral powers have taken initiatives to make peace through negotiations, these have not been effective due to their plans being removed from ground realities. Ukraine and the European powers are unlikely to be moved by plans which cede Ukrainian territories to Russia. The European powers without American support cannot push Ukraine to a position of strength. The recent Presidential elections in US suggest that people have lesser appetite for supporting the causes and squandering of American resources for distant countries whereas economic concerns such as inflation and immigration have greater resilience with the masses. In this light and keeping in with speeches of the President-elect Trump during campaign trail, it is obvious that Ukraine is most likely to be bereft of substantial amount of American funds and military assistance which could turn its fate in its favour. There is a growing realisation within the political circle as well that the US has been hard-pressed to sustain military supplies to allies in various theatres of wars and conflicts such as simultaneous supplies of military aircrafts and missiles to Israel and Taiwan have led Pentagon to cancel supplies of the same to Ukraine. Once the Republicans come to dominate both the houses of the Congress, Ukraine in need of desperate military and financial assistance would face further hiccups in the chances of getting them. However, if Ukraine is pushed to negotiation from the current battlefield realities, Russia is sure to gain almost all the advantages that a victory in the war would have allowed. War-fatigued Russia has been sticking to wait out the Western commitment to Ukraine, if that happens then Moscow has everything to relish. There are neoconservatives from the GOP who still believe that American primacy in world affairs must prevail and Russia must pay a heavy price for its invasion of Ukraine. In February 2024, twenty two Senators/national security hawks from the Republican Party supported military assistance to Ukraine joining with the Democrats and defying the GOP's stance. President-elect Trump himself might not want Russia to win all these advantages let alone the believers of American exceptionalism and its primacy. Nobody knows what is on the anvil a ceasefire, armistice or a frozen conflict. However, it is really a matter of concern how both the parties to the war can be brought to a negotiation table without any of them being perceived defeated by their own people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdPx3o3vNCgAV	2024-11-15T09:06:13-08:00	
Christian Bashers Rip Hegseth And Huckabee – OpEd	They’ve started already. One week after the election and the Christian bashers are foaming at the mouth over president-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Pete Hegseth to be Secretary of Defense and Mike Huckabee to be U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Hegseth is a strong Christian who literally wears his religion on his body (he has more than a dozen tattoos emblazoned on his right arm and chest). To be sure, that is bizarre, but that is not what his critics are upset about. They don’t like what the tattoos represent—Christianity. If he had metal spikes hanging from his nose, or had tattoos honoring Lucifer on his neck, that would be fine. But once Jesus is brought into the mix, that’s a call to arms. Indeed, the Christian bashers are explicitly calling him out for wanting a call to arms—they are saying he wants to bring back the Crusades. The Jerusalem Cross on Hegseth’s chest is driving them mad. The left-wing folks at the Daily Beast informed their fans that it is 'a 13th century Crusades symbol, over his right bicep.' They are twice wrong. They are off by 200 hundred years (it dates back to the 11th century, 1099 to be exact) and it is located on his chest, not his right arm. After the overthrow of the Crusader state in 1291, the Jerusalem Cross remained a symbol of Jerusalem for Christians, and today it is the emblem of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, hardly an extremist organization. Another reminder of the Crusades is the Latin phrase, 'Deus Vult,' which means 'God wills it': it is on Hegseth’s right bicep. It is true that it was a rallying cry during the First Crusade. So what? A human rights left-wing activist group from the U.K., Action on Armed Violence, is also exercised about all the Crusader symbols. It says 'Deus Vult' was invoked to 'justify acts of religious violence.' The Bulwark, a publication by the angry never-Trumper Bill Kristol, says these Crusader images are 'disturbing.' What is really disturbing is their ignorance. The Crusades were a defensive reaction to Muslim aggression. Princeton’s Bernard Lewis, one of the world’s most noted historians, says, 'The Crusade was a delayed response to the jihad, the holy war for Islam, and its purpose was to recover by war what had been lost by war—to free the holy places of Christendom and open them once again, without impediment, to Christian pilgrimage.' Also, the Crusaders were volunteers, not papal conscripts. Just as important, according to St. Louis University professor Thomas F. Madden, who has written extensively on this subject, 'All the Crusades met the criteria for just wars.' Action on Armed Violence and the Bulwark slam Hegseth for his ties to Christian nationalism. As I recently pointed out, this is one of the greatest anti-Christian smear jobs of our day. Digging deep, any researcher worth his salt knows how vacuous these charges are. Examples of 'Christian nationalism' include saying in public, 'Blessed is the nation whose God is Lord.' That happens to be Psalm 33:12. Those who say that Trump 'loves the United States of America. He loves God,' are cited as examples of this bogeyman. Singing 'God Bless America' is another indicator of Christian fanaticism. Mike Huckabee is an Evangelical Christian who is a rock-solid supporter of Israel. But according to John Hudson at the Washington Post that is a problem. He is worried that people like Huckabee, who believe that in the covenant that God made to Abraham about Israel, 'have turned that belief into a right-wing brand of Zionism.' Similarly, the militants at J Street have lashed out at Huckabee for his 'extremist views.' Louis Moreno, a former U.S. Ambassador who knows Huckabee, calls him an 'utter nut case.' Why? Because the former Arkansas governor believes in the biblical account of the end of times. If he believed the fiction that the sexes are interchangeable, that would be considered reasonable. Vanity Fair wins the prize for the most irresponsible accusation against Huckabee. After it posts a short critical account of Trump’s nominee, it offers what it calls a Fun Fact. 'Huckabee is a Christian Zionist; Christian Zionists believe ‘Muslims, Jews, and non-Christians are ultimately damned.’' Where did that incendiary comment come from? Apparently from the website of Political Research Associates, a left-wing outlet. It has a post, '101 Christian Zionists,' with lots of statements and links to its sources. On p. 2 it lists five beliefs that it attributes to Christian Zionists, including the one mentioned by Vanity Fair. But unlike most of the other beliefs it cites, this one is not linked to any source, nor is it in quotes. In other words, it was made up by Political Research Associates and Vanity Fair cited it as if it were authoritative. Radicals hate Pete Hegseth because he is a committed Christian and a patriotic American. They hate Mike Huckabee because he is a committed Christian who defends Israel. It’s really not all that complicated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdLRIeszN745R	2024-11-15T09:05:23-08:00	
Self-Perception And Body Image Of Women: An Overview – OpEd	Self-perception and body image are complex and powerful aspects of identity, especially for women, who face unique societal pressures and expectations. The key insights into self-perception and body image among women include: a. Media Influence: Media, including social media, has a significant impact on body image. Photoshopped images, filters, and idealized beauty standards create unattainable ideals. Many women feel pressured to conform to these ideals, which can lead to dissatisfaction with their own bodies. The 'thin ideal' has long been prevalent in Western media, though there’s been a shift toward celebrating a more diverse range of body types. However, some media still focus on specific body types or features, which can make it hard for women to fully accept their natural shapes. b. Social and Cultural Pressures: Society often links a woman's worth to her appearance, creating pressure to look a certain way. Cultural ideals vary but can include expectations about weight, skin colour, hair, and facial features. Family, friends, and even romantic partners can influence body image through comments and feedback, whether positive or negative. For example, offhand remarks about weight can shape how women see themselves and contribute to self-esteem issues. c. Age and Body Image: Body image concerns can start early, with many girls becoming aware of societal beauty standards by adolescence. Teenage years are a critical period, where comparisons to peers and celebrities are common, often resulting in self-criticism. As women age, body image concerns may shift. Older women may experience changes in self-perception due to life events like pregnancy, menopause, or aging, which can affect the body in various ways. d. Psychological Impact: Negative body image can lead to low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Many women internalize societal standards, feeling inadequate if they don’t match these ideals, which affects mental health. Eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are extreme manifestations of body image issues and are often rooted in a negative self-perception. Women are disproportionately affected by these conditions, highlighting the mental health risks associated with body image struggles. Self-perception and body image are deeply personal and shaped by external forces. A supportive social environment and access to positive, diverse representations can help foster healthier body image perceptions for women. Causes of change Changes in self-perception and body image can be driven by various factors, ranging from personal experiences to societal trends. These shifts can have both positive and negative effects on how individuals view themselves. The major causes of changes in self-perception and body image include: a. Life Stages and Physical Changes: Adolescence: Puberty brings significant physical changes that affect how young people see themselves. These changes can bring insecurity, especially if adolescents feel they do not align with societal ideals. Pregnancy and Postpartum: Pregnancy changes the body drastically, and new mothers may experience shifts in self-perception. Postpartum, women often face new physical realities that can affect body image. Aging: As people grow older, physical changes like wrinkles, changes in body shape, and hair loss can alter self-perception. Aging is often stigmatized, which can contribute to negative body image. b. Weight Changes and Health Conditions: Weight Gain or Loss: Major weight fluctuations, whether from lifestyle changes, medical conditions, or intentional weight loss, can lead to shifts in body image. People often reassess their self-perception based on their body’s current state. Health Issues and Disabilities: Chronic illness, injury, or disability can alter body functionality and appearance, impacting how people feel about themselves. For some, this shift might bring self-acceptance, while for others, it can lead to self-consciousness. c. Cultural and Societal Trends: Beauty and Fashion Trends: As society's beauty ideals change over time, so does body image. For example, the 'thin ideal' of the 1990s and 2000s has gradually shifted toward celebrating more diverse body shapes. Gender Roles and Expectations: Cultural and societal expectations of gender roles also influence body image. For women, these roles may include pressure to appear youthful, fit, and attractive, while men might face pressure to look muscular and strong. d. Mental Health and Self-Esteem: Low Self-Esteem: People with low self-esteem are more likely to be self-critical about their appearance. This can intensify changes in body image over time, leading to dissatisfaction even when there’s no actual change in appearance. Mental Health Conditions: Conditions like depression, anxiety, or body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can distort self-perception, leading individuals to see themselves in a negative or unrealistic light. e. Relationships and Romantic Partners: Romantic Relationships: Partners’ opinions can heavily impact self-perception. Positive reinforcement can boost body confidence, while criticism or comments about appearance can lead to self-doubt and insecurity. Breakups and New Relationships: After a breakup, people might reassess their appearance or focus on personal improvement. Similarly, entering a new relationship can sometimes bring renewed focus on appearance. Overall, self-perception and body image are highly dynamic and can shift with life’s stages, societal influences, and internal growth. Encouraging a healthy, balanced view of oneself, while challenging negative influences, can foster a positive self-image. Management of concepts Managing self-perception and body image involves building a positive relationship with oneself, embracing a balanced perspective, and developing coping strategies to handle external pressures. There are some strategies that can help improve and manage self-perception and body image: a. Limit Negative Media Exposure: Curate Your Social Media Feed: Follow accounts that promote body positivity, diversity, and self-acceptance. Unfollow those that lead to negative self-comparisons or unrealistic standards. b. Focus on Health, Not Appearance: Set Functional Goals: Aim to improve strength, energy, flexibility, or mental well-being rather than focusing exclusively on appearance-based goals. Listen to Your Body: Practice mindful eating, regular physical activity, and rest. Appreciate your body for its capabilities and try to connect health efforts to how you feel rather than how you look. c. Engage in Therapy or Counselling: Seek Professional Help: Working with a therapist, especially one trained in body image or self-esteem issues, can help you explore the roots of negative self-perception and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT is particularly effective for managing body image issues, as it helps you recognize and alter negative thought patterns and behaviors related to self-image. d. Limit Comparisons: Avoid Social Comparisons: Comparing yourself to others, whether in person or online, is a common source of body dissatisfaction. Remind yourself that everyone has unique strengths and features, and focus on your own journey. Use Journaling: Journaling can help you explore and understand your personal journey with body image without judgment or comparison. Reflect on your own achievements and progress rather than external standards. Improving self-perception and body image is a journey that takes time and patience. Building a supportive environment, practicing self-care, and reframing negative thoughts can help us develop a healthier, more balanced self-image.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFohquz_oOlm	2024-11-15T09:04:30-08:00	
A Leader’s Quest: Restoring Dignity And Autonomy In A Divided Lan...	Omar Abdullah’s return to office as Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in October 2024 is a powerful moment for the region, marking a shift towards a potential restoration of autonomy and statehood lost after the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. Following a decisive election victory by the National Conference, Abdullah stepped into leadership at a time when Jammu and Kashmir faces unique political and social challenges. The abrogation of Article 370 had stripped the region of its special status and divided it into two Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Abdullah’s leadership has reignited hopes for restoring the region’s statehood, creating a strong foundation for a future rooted in self-governance and regional identity. Omar Abdullah’s first move as Chief Minister was the formation of a ten-member Council of Ministers, chosen carefully to ensure an equal representation of voices from both Jammu and Kashmir regions. This inclusive approach is seen as a way to foster harmony and regional unity, recognizing the distinct needs and aspirations of the area’s diverse population. The National Conference’s commitment to equitable representation underscores Abdullah’s intent to navigate Jammu and Kashmir’s future through collaborative governance. By bringing balanced voices to the council, Abdullah has signaled his awareness of the socio-political complexities and his dedication to a collective approach in tackling the region’s challenges. One of Abdullah’s earliest and most decisive actions came on October 17, 2024, when his cabinet unanimously passed a resolution calling on the central government to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood. This move, which quickly gained approval from Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, was a significant step in formalizing the statehood cause. Although Abdullah faced some criticism for not first putting the resolution to a vote in the Assembly, his direct action reflects the urgency he attaches to this issue. The resolution for restoring Article 370, which the J&K Assembly passed on November 6, 2024, further highlighted Abdullah’s dedication to autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 and Article 35A, prior to their revocation, had granted Jammu and Kashmir a unique status within India, including the right to have its own constitution and considerable autonomy over local governance. Article 370 allowed the state legislature exclusive powers to make laws on various matters, such as property ownership and residency rights, while Article 35A provided the legislative authority to define 'permanent residents' and ensure exclusive rights to them. The 2019 revocation of these articles brought Jammu and Kashmir fully under the Indian Constitution, opening the region to settlement from other states and changing the landscape of property ownership, employment, and welfare benefits. The November resolution, led by Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Singh Choudhary, called for a dialogue with the Indian government to reinstate these protections. While BJP members in the Assembly protested and argued the resolution was not on the day’s agenda, Speaker Abdur Rahim Rather moved forward with a vote, ultimately leading to its passage. This decision, while divisive, was seen as a bold reaffirmation of the region’s desire for autonomy, and Abdullah’s role in pushing this agenda underscores his commitment to restoring constitutional safeguards for Jammu and Kashmir. Despite these promising steps, Abdullah’s administration is limited by the constraints placed on the Union Territory Assembly, following amendments that vested the Lieutenant Governor with considerable power over administrative and legal matters. Nonetheless, the Assembly remains an essential platform for the people of Jammu and Kashmir to voice their concerns, including their advocacy for statehood, human rights, and political representation. Under Abdullah’s leadership, the Assembly has amplified calls for addressing these issues, reinforcing that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are actively engaged in shaping their future despite the Union Territory’s limited legislative power. Abdullah’s administration has made it clear that it will continue to prioritize advocacy for autonomy, underscoring the Assembly’s role as a voice for the people’s aspirations, even amid political limitations. The future of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood restoration efforts, however, remains uncertain. Abdullah’s actions have brought the issue to the forefront of Indian politics, and the assurances from Home Minister Amit Shah and the formal endorsement from Lieutenant Governor Sinha suggest positive momentum. Yet, many are wary of potential delays from the central government, which must balance its commitment to Jammu and Kashmir with broader national priorities. The ongoing efforts by Abdullah’s administration to secure statehood and constitutional guarantees will likely be met with both support and resistance, reflecting the complexities of Jammu and Kashmir’s relationship with the Indian Union. Whether these initiatives lead to lasting change or encounter further delays, Abdullah’s leadership continues to represent the resilience and resolve of the people of Jammu and Kashmir as they pursue a future rooted in self-governance and restored identity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSQWEk4z4yIff6SFsl4cye	2024-11-15T09:02:37-08:00	
Tourism In Pakistan: Discovering The Hidden Paradise Of Kashmir –...	Pakistan, with its diverse landscapes and rich cultural heritage, is gradually emerging as a top travel destination. While the bustling cities of Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi often take center stage, there's one region in the northern part of the country that remains an undiscovered gem- Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Known for its breathtaking natural beauty, AJK is becoming increasingly popular among tourists looking for an escape from the ordinary. With its lush valleys, pristine lakes, snow-capped peaks, and serene meadows, AJK is often called the 'Switzerland of the East' or 'Heaven on Earth.' For much of its modern history, Azad Jammu and Kashmir was a place visitors couldn’t easily reach. Political tensions and regional conflicts kept this stunning area off the map for international tourists. However, following a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2004, the region slowly began to open up. What was once a place of uncertainty has now blossomed into one of the most promising tourist destinations in Pakistan. Over the years, the number of visitors has steadily increased, and the region's tourism infrastructure has begun to improve. In 2015, more than a million tourists visited the area, and that number has continued to grow each year. AJK offers a rich mix of natural beauty and tranquility that is difficult to find elsewhere. The towering peaks of the Himalayas, the winding rivers, and the thick forests all create an atmosphere that feels almost otherworldly. One of the most famous spots is Neelum Valley, a stunning stretch of land nestled between the mountains. With its flowing rivers, verdant meadows, and charming villages like Keran and Sharda, it’s the perfect place to disconnect and experience the beauty of nature. The valley is a haven for hikers, photographers, and anyone seeking a peaceful retreat away from the noise and stress of everyday life. Another must-see is Ratti Gali Lake, located high in the mountains at over 12,000 feet. This alpine lake is surrounded by snow-covered peaks, creating a breathtakingly beautiful scene that draws photographers, nature lovers, and adventurers. The azure waters of the lake reflect the towering mountains, making it a perfect spot for those seeking both adventure and serenity. But it’s not just the scenery that makes AJK so special. The region is also steeped in history and culture, making it a place of both natural and historical exploration. From the ancient Sharda Peeth temple, an important pilgrimage site, to the ruins of forts and historical buildings scattered across the region, AJK is a treasure trove of culture and history. The blend of Kashmiri, Punjabi, and Central Asian influences gives the region a unique cultural identity that sets it apart from other parts of the world. The hospitality of the people is another highlight. Known for their warmth and friendliness, the people of AJK go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome. Local cuisine is an essential part of the cultural experience, with traditional Kashmiri dishes like Wazwan and flavorful teas like Kahwa offering a taste of the region’s rich culinary heritage. Food lovers will find themselves enjoying the variety of spices and flavors unique to this mountainous region. While tourism in AJK is still in its early stages compared to other global destinations, the potential is immense. Over the past few years, the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has made significant investments in tourism-related infrastructure, such as better roads, improved hotel accommodations, and enhanced facilities for visitors. These efforts are already paying off, with tourism revenue steadily increasing and more visitors arriving each year. In fact, in 2017 alone, AJK attracted 1.75 million tourists, up from 1.14 million in 2015, and the region’s tourism earnings amounted to PKR 67.378 million in the 2016-17 fiscal year. The financial impact of tourism is not limited to just AJK—it’s a key part of the larger picture for Pakistan’s economy. In 2017, Pakistan’s tourism sector contributed an impressive 7.4% to the country’s GDP, which amounted to around PKR 2,349 billion. Tourism in Pakistan has been a significant source of jobs, with the sector generating over 1.4 million jobs, or 2.5% of the country’s total employment. The tourism industry is expected to continue growing, with a predicted 7% increase in the sector in 2018, further solidifying its role as a key economic driver. Tourism also plays a crucial role in foreign exchange, as visitor exports accounted for 3.6% of Pakistan’s total exports in 2016. Moreover, Travel & Tourism investment amounted to PKR 410.4 billion in 2017, contributing 9.1% of total national investment. The government of Pakistan has been actively working to promote tourism in regions like AJK, recognizing its potential to boost the local economy, create jobs, and enhance the country's international image. The growing number of tourists, the increase in infrastructure investment, and the rise in tourism earnings all signal a bright future for AJK’s tourism industry. The region's growing popularity is also benefiting the local economy. More tourists mean more jobs, whether in hospitality, transportation, or small businesses that cater to visitors. In fact, tourism in AJK is expected to become one of the main drivers of economic growth in the region. It’s not just about the natural beauty or the historical sites- it’s about the opportunity to create jobs, stimulate local economies, and give the world a glimpse of a place that was once hidden away. Looking ahead, the future of tourism in Azad Jammu and Kashmir is incredibly bright. As more visitors from around the world discover the region, it’s likely that AJK will become a key destination for travelers seeking a unique experience. The government is continuing to improve security, infrastructure, and visa policies to make the region more accessible, and as these efforts progress, the tourism industry will likely see rapid growth. Pakistan as a whole is beginning to understand the true value of its tourism potential. With regions like AJK offering stunning landscapes, rich history, and warm hospitality, the country is well-positioned to become a major player in the global tourism market. It’s clear that places like Azad Jammu and Kashmir are not just valuable for their natural beauty- they are also vital to the country’s economic future. AJK’s rapid rise as a travel destination is a testament to its potential. As more people visit, the region’s beauty and hospitality will continue to shine, offering a peaceful and unforgettable escape. For anyone looking to explore the untouched beauty of northern Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir is waiting to be discovered- a place that feels like a dream come true, and one that is poised to leave a lasting impression on all who visit.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSQWEk4z4yIVpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-15T09:01:40-08:00	
South Africa: Precision Policing A Vital Element Of Reducing Fire...	By David Bruce Mass killings have wreaked havoc in numerous South African communities in recent months. Along with the devastating murder of 18 people in Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape province on 28 September, other attacks have taken a heavy toll on human life. These occurred in places as disparate as Qumbu, Bityi and Tsolo in the Eastern Cape, Bishop Lavis and Atlantis in the Western Cape, Orange Farm in Gauteng province and Orkney in North West province. We don’t know the exact reasons for each of these incidents. But there can be no doubt that the widespread availability of firearms to those involved in crime makes mass killings more possible and more likely. These killings are one of many reasons the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), in a new policy brief, is calling for the South African Police Service (SAPS) to develop an integrated strategy to reduce firearm crime. This should ensure clear and measurable reductions in all categories of crime associated with the use of guns. Mass killings have become an embedded feature of violence in South Africa. The number of people killed in Lusikisiki is slightly higher than the death toll at the Mdlalose Tavern shooting in Soweto in July 2022, when 16 people were killed. In April 2023, 10 family members died in a single shooting incident in Imbali in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal province. The widespread availability of guns undoubtedly makes mass killings more possible and more likely Mass killings have reached unprecedented levels in South Africa since the early 1990s. SAPS data for July-September 2023 showed 125 people killed in incidents with four or more deaths. Recently released data compiled by Gun Free South Africa showed a similar number had been murdered in shootings of four or more people in the past three months. Firearms are crime enablers and violence multipliers. They make a massive contribution to crime-related deaths, injury and fear in South Africa. Police data indicates that guns were used in 12 000 to 16 000 murders in South Africa over the 2023/24 year. There were also between 17 000 and 20 000 cases of attempted murder, where people sustained non-fatal firearm injuries. The severity and complexity of many of these injuries place an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Inga Mkoko, who was 25 at the time of the Mdlalose tavern shooting, spent three weeks in intensive care and six months in hospital. He had both legs amputated and lost four fingers. Notwithstanding the large number of firearm-related deaths and injuries, guns are mostly used to threaten victims without the weapons being fired. Fear of firearms makes them the favoured instrument for coercion in robberies, extortion and some incidents of rape. They also play a major role in taxi violence and violent organised crimes such as extortion and conflict between gangs involved in the illegal drugs or mining trade. SAPS must focus on reducing firearm crime, but cannot do so using its established approach The fact that criminals have the capacity to use equivalent levels of force to the police directly undermines the state’s ability to exercise authority. Virtually all killings of SAPS members are with firearms. The SAPS must focus on reducing firearm crime. But it cannot do so using its established approach that relies mainly on the recovery of illegal firearms. A key element is making optimal use of available data. As a starting point, police should use crime statistics to identify the areas where most firearm crime occurs. The recently released ISS policy brief illustrates how this can be done. The SAPS should be able, quite easily, to map firearm crime. Effective mapping is vital to ensuring that police resources are deployed in a precise way, targeted at the groups involved and places where it’s occurring. A key solution is making optimal use of available data to quickly and accurately map firearm crime Beyond mapping, the SAPS should invest in strengthening information management systems to synthesise information on firearm crime. This includes crime reports, ballistic data, interviews with suspects, victims and witnesses, and details from sources in the community. This process, along with crime investigation, should then be used to identify, arrest and prosecute perpetrators of firearm crime. This approach can also dramatically improve our understanding of where guns used in crime are coming from. Tracing the source of these weapons would allow for proactive interventions to close loopholes that enable criminal access to firearms. Recovery of illegal firearms is not enough. South Africa needs a practical firearm reduction strategy that provides for collaboration between appropriate state, private sector and civil society role players. There is knowledge and experience of firearm crime reduction in South Africa and internationally that SAPS can draw on. Effective implementation of an integrated firearm crime reduction strategy should be an exercise in learning how a more effective SAPS can work. Without it, gun crime is likely to continue devastating many families and communities. Read the ISS policy brief ‘Targeting firearm crime will make South Africa safer’ by David Bruce, here.

RCEP Provides A Path To Regional Trade Cooperation – Analysis	By Iman Pambagyo and Donna Gultom As global trade began to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 10 ASEAN member states and their five FTA partners sealed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement on 15 November 2020 during a summit of participating country leaders. Requiring eight years of negotiation to complete, the RCEP initiative was first introduced when Indonesia was chair of ASEAN in 2011 with a view to consolidating the existing ASEAN Plus One FTAs to deepen and expand regional value chains. The basic concept of RCEP was endorsed by leaders of 16 countries in November 2012 in Phnom Penh, and the first round of negotiations took place in March 2013 in Brunei Darussalam where negotiators had more questions than answers on how to translate the RCEP concept into an effective trade agreement. Initially, RCEP was negotiated among 16 countries — ten ASEAN countries and Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. At the RCEP Summit in late 2019, India decided to leave the negotiations due to difficulties at home. India’s exit raised doubts among some non-ASEAN negotiating parties that the targeted total market size of RCEP would shrink from 3.7 billion to 2.3 billion people. ASEAN’s leadership in getting negotiations across the finish line proved critical. The key message conveyed to the non-ASEAN participating countries was that RCEP was not merely about market access. RCEP would also serve as a platform for countries in proximity to ASEAN to enhance regional cooperation and to deepen and expand the regional value chains that already existed under ASEAN Plus One FTAs — contributing to the economic advancement of individual partners as well as the region. After going through the ratification process with individual participating countries, RCEP eventually entered into force on 1 January 2022. Representing around 30 per cent of the world’s GDP, 28 per cent of global trade and 32 per cent of global foreign direct investment flows, the RCEP Agreement was championed to significantly benefit all its parties through the intensification of trade in goods and services, investment, trade facilitation and cooperation among members. RCEP has been in place for over two years, but available data suggests that utilisation of the preferential treatment under the Agreement — especially on trade in goods — is still far below what had been expected, with China, Japan and Korea currently the main beneficiaries. But this should not come as a surprise. RCEP was concluded against the backdrop of a trade war between the United States and China, which has had adverse impacts on other countries, including most RCEP members. RCEP also entered into force when global trade had to deal with the spread of COVID-19, continued geopolitical rivalries among major powers, war in Ukraine and climate change issues affecting logistics in the Panama Canal. The war between Israel and Hamas and the security threats to shipping lines through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal have added to concerns that world trade is disintegrating. Eight years of RCEP negotiations have shown that focusing on shared economic interests can lead to mutual benefits instead of an escalation of disagreements toward open conflicts. ASEAN played an important role in keeping all parties engaged constructively when its negotiation encountered non-economic hurdles between Japan and South Korea and between India and China. Statements by leaders at various RCEP summits suggest that the spirit of cooperation incentivised them to create a region of strong collaboration towards shared prosperity, regardless of differences in political, economic and social systems. While RCEP does not the disciplines of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Peter A Petri and Michael Plummer — writing for the Brookings Institution in 2020 — note that ‘the effects of RCEP are impressive’ and that ‘it incentivises supply chains across the region but also caters to political sensitivities’. RCEP was made possible because negotiations were advanced in an ‘ASEAN way’ — consensual, flexible and sometimes very slow. This negotiation style needs to be applied as a trade diplomacy strategy by its members when trying to build cooperation and collaboration between RCEP and other economic groupings such as the EU, Southern Common Market and the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. The ‘ASEAN way’ able to seal the deal when there is consensus and flexibility but progresses slowly and carefully when dealing with contentious issues, which otherwise bring negotiations to an impasse. All the RCEP countries now have experience negotiating unusually complex issues. This experience can be applied when they embark on global trade diplomacy with non-RCEP countries and regions.

A Deep Dive Into The India-Russia Economic Relationship – Analysi...	By Rajoli Siddharth Jayaprakash In the past decade, the core drivers of India-Russia relations have begun shifting. The traditionally dominant military-technical partnership has declined, with India buying less Russian weapons, technology and military platforms. The economic pillar stagnated as military dealings slowed, with bilateral trade hoveringaround the US$ 10-11 billion mark. However, since 24 February, 2022, there has been a dramatic uptick in economic ties, with India emerging as Russia's second-largest trade partner. In 2022, bilateral trade surgedto US$ 49 billion, and by the end of 2023, US$ 65 billion. This uptick in trade is primarily attributed to the increasing discounts on oil purchases offered to Indian refiners, as India did not join the sanctions regime against Russia. Along with increasing oil trade, the non-oil trade has also marginally increased in the trade basket. Along with these new trends in bilateral trade, there is a significant overestimation of the India-Russia economic cooperation, which has led to condemnation from the Group of Seven countries (G7), comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States). Trends in the Ttrade basket While it’s no surprise that hydrocarbon imports dominate the trade basket, in 2023, US$ 54 billion of the US$ 65 billion exports comprised oil imports from Russia. Similar trends were reflected in the previous year; out of the US$49 billion total trade,US $38 billion constituted oil imports. The overall trade has grown with the increasing oil and mineral imports from Russia. For instance, in 2021, bilateral trade was US$ 12 billion, where oil and mineral fuels constituted only US$ 5.2 billion of the total trade, leaving US$ 6.8 billion in non-oil trade. In 2022 and 2023, non-oil trade increased to US$ 11 billion, a significant growth, indicative of bilateral trade increasing. Since 2022, Russia’s fertiliser exports have grown substantially. The average Indian import of Russian Fertiliser was around US$ 600 million; however, in 2022-23, fertiliser imports increased to US$ 3 billion. It later declined in the following year, primarily because Russia ended previous discounts on the sale of di-ammonium phosphate. Further, the import of precious stones, metals, and jewellery has increased since 2021. Similarly, Russia’s export of edible vegetables and animal and vegetable fats has increased.

Pharmaceutical exports are steadily declining. By 2024, pharmaceutical exports from India had declined to US$ 386 million (see Fig 1.2). Further, trade across items such as tea, coffee, and spices has fluctuated, as well as with clothing accessories. However, the export of some commodities has increased since the invasion, such as iron and steel, electrical machinery and consumer electronics, organic and inorganic chemicals, compounds of precious metals, rare-earth metals, soap and by-products, ceramic products, automobiles and spare parts, and medical and surgical equipment. However, one of the biggest Indian exports that surged in 2023-2024, since the invasion, was the export of machinery and mechanical appliances, which increased from US$ 320 million to US$ 650 million. Further, in 2024, from April to August, machinery imports rose to US$ 700 million. The increase in export volumes of these goods is one of the reasons why India’s total export surged from US$ 3.1 billion to US$ 4.2 billion in 2024. Based on early projections for 2024-2025, it is likely that trade across consumer goods, electronics, machinery, and spare parts will increase. The improvement in trade and increasing avenues for economic cooperation have emerged due to the vacuum left by Western firms in the Russian economy which allowed Russia to spend the rupees accumulated in its accounts since February 2022.

India’s trade with Russia, even though diversified, is not on a large scale in comparison to other Group of 20 (G20) countries (sans Russia). Neither are there any vast business interests for Indian elites in Russia, apart from oil and pharma, which is why trade data does not reflect any new avenues of trade except in consumer goods and electronics. In November 2022, Moscow sent a list of goods to New Delhi for delivery, including parts for cars, trains, and aircraft. The list consisted of more than 500 entries. It is clear that New Delhi has not supplied Russia with any of the big-ticket items, such as aircraft engines or equipment with high dual-use capabilities (beyond spare parts), as bilateral trade data reflects that trade for the parts requested by Moscow has been minimal. Furthermore, New Delhi’s defence imports to Russia are a by-product of the bilateral military-technical partnership and to setup joint ventures. Further, trade data does not reflect any sale of restricted critical technology to Russia, as claimed by a few sources. The sources cite drones worth US$ 5 million and goods worth US$ 600,000 that were re-exported via Kyrgyzstan. Recently, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions against 19 Indian firms for their alleged involvement in the supply of dual-use goods to Moscow, including a few pharmaceutical companies based in Mumbai re-exporting Dell Technologies’ most advanced server, Dell PowerEdge XE9680, worth US$ 434 million to Russia. Despite these claims, no evidence clearly substantiates them. For instance, with regards to the first claim of India exporting drones via Kyrgyzstan, the numbers do not add up. Since 2022, trade with Bishkek for electronic products has not crossed US$1 million. Similarly, in the case of arms and ammunition and parts, the trade does not exceed US$ 480,000. Furthermore, in a globalised world where trade takes precedence, trading firms in countries near Russia re-route such trade. For instance, several US and European firms exported US$ 1.2 billion worth of microchips, which were later re-routed from Türkiye and Kazakhstan. Therefore, despite allegations, trade data does not justify the charges. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in response to the criticism, stated that the firms involved did not violate any Indian law, as New Delhi did not recognise non-UN-approved sanctions. Since early 2024, Western sanctions against Russia have intensified, compelling India to take a stance. For instance, early this year, TotalEnergies invoked a force majeure on Russia’s Arctic LNG-2 project, which led to production being suspended. In the past, Indian firms were interested in purchasing stakes in Novatek’s (a major Russian gas company) Arctic LNG-2 project as part of New Delhi’s outreach to the Russian Arctic. However, the subsequent rounds of European Union (EU) sanctions targeting Russian Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) have prompted New Delhi to announce that it would not purchase LNG from the Arctic LNG 2 project. Interestingly, despite waves of sanctions against Russian energy, the EU continues to import LNG from Russia. Imports have increased by 20 percent this year. The EU has a selective approach to imposing and complying with sanctions. On the one hand, it criticises New Delhi with allegations of India reinforcing the Kremlin coffers, fueling Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. On the other hand, the EU continues to purchase Russian energy. Issue of payments Lastly, even though India was able to address payment issues by extending the Special Rupee-Vostro account facility to Russian businesses, certain challenges remain. Regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India, have limited foreign portfolio investments by Sberbank AG, Russia’s largest bank, to hydrocarbons only. Furthermore, because of Russia's classification as a 'high-risk' country by the Financial Action Task Force, the commerce ministry’s Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) continues to place Russia in the same category, despite the MEA and the Indian Embassy in Moscow’s request for a reevaluation. Conclusion India’s trade with Russia must be viewed from the point of view of one driven by supply and demand factors and not through the intervention of a political apparatus. With bilateral trade likely to continue and intensify with Russia, the intensity of secondary sanctions might impact New Delhi’s economic engagement with Moscow. India is presented with a set of challenges: it must sustain its engagement with Moscow while continuing to further its cooperation with the West, all while ensuring that its short-and medium-term energy security needs are addressed. Navigating these challenges will be essential for India as it seeks to balance its strategic interests in a complex global landscape.

Bending Reality: How Surrealism Reveals The Subjectivity Of Time ...	Time, as a concept, has perplexed humanity for centuries. Our understanding of it oscillates between the linear and cyclical, the tangible and the surreal, the mathematical and the metaphysical. But more than anything, time is subjective—an experience rather than a measurable constant. When examined through the lens of surrealism, time emerges as not merely a sequence of events but a fabric that our perceptions, desires, and fears weave. The Nature of Time To understand why time is subjective, it is essential to distinguish between 'clock time,' or chronological time, and 'psychological time.' Clock time is the scientific, standardized measurement—seconds, minutes, hours—that our society depends on to synchronize actions. Psychological time, however, is an entirely personal experience. It can stretch and compress, influenced by our emotions, memories, and the intensity of the moment. Surrealism and the Dream State of Time Surrealism, as a movement, broke free from the constraints of logic, reality, and linearity. It allowed artists and thinkers to explore dreams, subconscious desires, and emotions in their raw, unfiltered forms. Central to surrealism is the fluidity of time, which often appears distorted, repetitive, or looping within surrealist works. This is famously depicted in Salvador Dalí's 'The Persistence of Memory,' where clocks melt in a barren, dream-like landscape. Here, time is not rigid; it is malleable, warped by the environment and the viewer's interpretation. Dalí's melting clocks illustrate an essential surrealist idea: time as an extension of the mind, subject to interpretation and transformation. Just as the subconscious mind operates outside of conventional temporality, surrealist art challenges viewers to experience time without strict boundaries. Freud, the Unconscious, and the Nonlinear Sigmund Freud, whose work heavily influenced surrealist artists, emphasized that the unconscious mind operates outside of linear time. In dreams, he argued, events from different periods of our lives coexist, sometimes merging, altering, or repeating. Surrealism tapped into this psychological framework, breaking down chronological barriers and presenting a world where past, present, and future coalesce. In surrealist paintings, there's often a sense that scenes do not unfold in a specific order but rather coexist in a single, fragmented reality. This idea is supported by the dream-like quality of time in surrealist works. Max Ernst's collages, for instance, bring together disparate, often anachronistic elements—a modern object might appear beside a medieval scene, blending temporal periods into one. Through these juxtapositions, Ernst mirrors the way memories and dreams function, where time is not consistent but scattered, dense, and elusive. Time in the Works of René Magritte Belgian surrealist René Magritte often manipulated time by contrasting ordinary objects in unusual contexts, giving viewers a sense of disorientation. Magritte's 'Time Transfixed' exemplifies this approach, showing a locomotive emerging from a fireplace. Here, two elements representing movement and stillness intersect. This unexpected pairing creates a surreal temporal illusion, blurring distinctions between 'now' and 'then,' motion and pause. Magritte's art demonstrates the surrealist view that time need not be sequential or rational. In our internal experience, memories and events bleed into each other, and logic becomes secondary to sensation. Surrealism, therefore, encourages us to question our perception of time as an orderly flow. Time and Memory: The Persistence of the Past One reason why time feels subjective is its connection to memory. Philosopher Henri Bergson argued that our experience of time is shaped by our memories, which accumulate and form an ever-expanding repository. This non-linear model of time resembles a spiral more than a line; the past continually resurfaces, influencing our experience of the present. Surrealist art often explores this fluid relationship between memory and time. Yves Tanguy, for instance, created vast landscapes filled with bizarre, indeterminate forms. These forms evoke a sense of déjà vu, as if the viewer has glimpsed them in a dream. The familiar becomes strange, and the past blurs with the present, highlighting the surrealists' view of time as a dimension molded by memory and nostalgia. The Subjective Flow of Time: Psychological Studies Psychologists have studied how emotions alter time perception. For example, moments of fear or exhilaration seem to stretch time, while monotonous tasks compress it. Surrealism plays on this perception by bringing viewers into scenes that are neither fully real nor dreamt, allowing time to lose its rigidity. In surrealist paintings, clocks are often distorted, disjointed, or absent altogether. This echoes our psychological experience of time: in intense moments, it becomes flexible, a quality that surrealism makes tangible. The surrealist movement embraced these subjective variations, presenting them as a more 'authentic' experience of time. Instead of a relentless tick-tock, surrealist time is alive, capable of slowing, freezing, or looping—a malleable entity. Time as Cyclical and Eternal Surrealist philosophy often aligns with the idea of cyclical or eternal time, as opposed to linear time. The works of Giorgio de Chirico illustrate a kind of eternal return, an endless repetition of similar scenes with subtle variations. His paintings, often set in timeless, deserted cityscapes, evoke a sense of déjà vu, an endless present. De Chirico's work suggests that time is not something we progress through but a state we are perpetually within. This echoes the Nietzschean concept of 'eternal recurrence,' which posits that all events endlessly repeat. Through surrealist art, the viewer is invited to contemplate the nature of existence and to experience a 'timeless' state where moments are not markers of progression but of repetition. The Legacy of Surrealism on Modern Perceptions of Time The surrealist approach to time has profoundly influenced modern philosophy, literature, and film. Works such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' and films like Inception and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind embody surrealism's treatment of time. These stories unfold in fractured, dream-like ways, mixing past, present, and future into complex patterns that defy linear logic. Surrealism's radical reimagining of time has thus permeated popular culture, resonating with our innate understanding that time is not simply measurable intervals but a deeply subjective and often illogical experience.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CjcODhEWHFgj	2024-11-14T16:42:19-08:00	
Kremlin, With Help From North Korea, Stages Major Push To Recaptu...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. North Korea and Russia Launch a Large-Scale Offensive in Kursk Augmented by 10,000 North Korean servicemen, the Russian military has amassed 50,000 troops for a large-scale counteroffensive to reclaim the Russian region of Kursk from Ukrainian forces. Open-source intelligence suggests that the campaign has already begun—at an overwhelming operational tempo. According to Ukrainian officials, the North Korean contingent, divided into an assault detachment and a group of supporting forces, is engaged in combat operations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov have stated that Pyongyang’s troops have already suffered casualties. Ukrainian intelligence has also determined that at least three high-ranking North Korean generals have combat deployed to oversee Pyongyang’s movements in the field. The most senior figure in the group is General Kim Yong Bok. Kim is the vice chief of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) General Staff, the commander of Pyongyang’s special forces, a military advisor to Kim Jong Un, and a member of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) Central Committee. Russia’s Kursk offensive features a noteworthy composition of forces. Naval infantry formations, particularly the 810th and 155th Brigades, are leading the offensive action to break Ukrainian lines. Social media reports have highlighted the involvement of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) in the effort. Russia’s defense industry has equipped the Kremlin’s marines with newly produced BTR-82 armored personnel carriers (APCs) to provide the units with protection, operational flexibility, speed, and mobility. Despite these advancements, Ukraine’s heavy detachments, such as the 47th Mechanized Brigade and the 95th Air Assault Brigade, have so far demonstrated remarkable resilience, holding their ground and inflicting damage on the Russian formations. Ukraine’s accumulated gains in Kursk have significant strategic implications and provide Kyiv with considerable diplomatic leverage. If United States President-elect Donald Trump seeks to impose a ceasefire and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Kyiv will be able to use the Russian territory it holds as a bargaining chip. The Kremlin is working to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk to deprive Kyiv of this leverage before the new US administration takes office. 2. Russian and Ukrainian Forces Exchange Massive Drone Barrages During the night of November 9, the Russian military launched a loitering munition salvo against multiple Ukrainian cities, including Zhytomyr, Odesa, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin launched 145 Iranian Shahed drone warfare systems from multiple sites including occupied Crimea. Ukraine’s air defenses intercepted only 62 of these drones. The strike, like many of the Kremlin’s prior attacks, risked significant collateral damage: some Russian drones wandered off their flight paths into Belarus and Moldova. In a previous strike, Russian loitering munitions hit the Estonian ambassador to Kyiv’s apartment building. The surge in Shahed attacks suggests that Russia and Iran’s joint drone manufacturing plant has further increased its production capacity. Kyiv answered the Kremlin’s salvo on November 10 with its largest drone strike since the beginning of the war. Russian air defense crews engaged 70 Ukrainian drones, 34 of which were targeting Moscow. Ukraine’s strike halted operations at the Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, and Zhukovsky airports in Moscow, severely disrupting Russian air traffic. The war between Russia and Ukraine has served as both a proving ground and an innovation incubator for armed drones, yielding new technologies, weapons systems, and concepts of operations (CONOPS) in the realm of unmanned systems. 3. Battlefield Assessment The Russian military has sought to capitalize on its offensive momentum by making a concerted push on the southern Donetsk front. Despite record-high personnel losses, Moscow’s forces have gained territory after seizing Vuhledar in October of this year. After the reported fall of Selydove, Russia’s next objective is the important logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Russian forces have also heightened their offensive activity in Kurakhove. A critical dam was recently destroyed, likely by Russian forces, which will exacerbate flooding in the area. The Ukrainian 46th Brigade is manning the defensive line in the face of growing Russian pressure. The Ukrainian General Staff has also detected heightened Russian military preparations in southern Ukraine, suggesting a large-scale Russian push that could threaten Zaporizhzhia. This effort, combined with ongoing Russian pressure in the east and counteroffensive operations in Kursk, could stretch Ukraine’s military even further. Kyiv is in danger of suffering drastic setbacks on the battlefield unless it can initiate changes with the help of its allies.

Blinken Atrocious In A Dangerous World – OpEd	It is hard to credit one of the least impressive Secretary of States the United States has ever produced with any merit other than being a plasterwork that, from time to time, moved with caution on the world stage for fear of cracking. On the stage, Antony Blinken’s brittle performances have been nothing short of unimpressive, notably in pursuing such projects comically titled 'Peace in the Middle East.' Each time he has ventured to various regions of the world, the combatants seem keener than ever to continue taking up arms or indulging in slaughter. A sense of Blinken’s detachment from the world can be gathered from his Foreign Affairs piece published on October 1, intended as something of a report on the diplomatic achievements of the Biden administration. It starts off with the sermonising treacle that is all a bit much – the naughty states on the world stage, albeit small in number (Russia, Iran, North Korea and China), 'determined to alter the foundational principles of the international system.' The Biden administration had, in response, 'pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad.' This served to counter those challengers wishing to 'undermine the free, open, secure, and prosperous world that the United States and most countries seek.' Then comes the remark that should prompt readers to pinch themselves. 'The Biden administration’s strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago.' An odd assessment for various reasons. There is the continued war in Ukraine and Washington’s refusal to encourage any meaningful talks between Kiev and Moscow, preferring, instead, the continued supply of weapons to an attritive conflict of slaughter and such acts of industrial terrorism as the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline. There has been the relentless watering down of the 'One China' understanding over the status of Taiwan, along with continued provocations against Beijing through the offensive pact of AUKUS with Australia and the UK. That particularly odious pact has served to turn Australia into a US military garrison without the consent of its citizens, an outcome sold to the dunces in Canberra as utterly necessary to arrest the rise of China. Along the way, an arms buildup in the Indo- and Asia-Pacific has been encouraged. With such a view of the world, it’s little wonder how blind Blinken, and other members of the Biden administration, have been to Israel’s own rogue efforts at breaking and altering the international system, committing, along the way, a goodly number of atrocities that have seen it taken to the International Court of Justice by South Africa for committing alleged acts of genocide. Through his various sojourns, the point was always clear. Israel was to be mildly rebuked, if at all, while Hamas was to be given the full chastising treatment as killers without a cause. When the barbarians revolt against their imperial governors, they are to be both feared and reviled. In June this year, for instance, Blinken stated on one of his countless missions for a non-existent peace that Hamas was 'the only obstacle' to a ceasefire, a markedly jaundiced explanation given the broader programs and objects being pursued by the Israeli Defence Forces. Hamas has been accused of being absolutist in its goals, but one can hardly exempt Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the charge. Not for Blinken: 'I think it is clear to everyone around the world, that it’s on them [Hamas] and that they will have made a choice to continue a war that they started.' On the issue of aid to Gaza’s strangled, dying population, Blinken has been, along with his equally ineffectual colleague in the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, cringingly ineffective. Their October 13 letter sent to their Israeli counterparts made mention of several demands, including the entry of some 350 aid trucks into Gaza on a daily basis, and refraining from adopting laws, now in place, banning the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). Each demand has been swatted back with a school child’s snotty petulance, and aid continues being blocked to various parts of Gaza. On October 24, Americans for Justice in Palestine Action (AJP Action) 'urgently' called on the Secretary of State 'to stop wasting his time with failed diplomatic visits and to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.' Those at AJP Action must surely have realised by now that Blinken would be utterly rudderless without those failed visits. Indeed, Osama Abu Irshaid, Executive Director of the organisation, went so far as to say that 'Blinken’s diplomatic theatre is enabling Netanyahu’s war crimes.' To arm and fund Israel 'while requesting a ceasefire' was a policy both 'hypocritical and ineffective.' Such is the nature of that sort of theatre. In the meantime, the tectonic plates of international relations are moving in other directions, a point that has been aided, not hindered, by the policy of this administration. Through BRICS and other satellite fora, the United States is finding itself gradually outpaced and isolated, even as it continues to hide behind the slogan of an international rules-based order it did so much to create. This is not to say that the US imperium has quite reached its terminus. If anything, the Biden administration, through the good offices of Blinken, continues to insist on its vitality. But US hegemony long left unchallenged is, most certainly, at an end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CkVSH0qoyici	2024-11-14T16:38:16-08:00	
Biden’s Legacy: Handing A Resurgent American Empire To Trump – Op...	One of the lasting legacies of U.S. President Joe Biden will be that he reinvigorated the American empire despite the risk of an increasingly authoritarian Donald Trump returning to lead it. Over the past four years, President Biden has continually ignored criticisms of U.S. empire and the dangers it poses to the world to direct the empire’s expansion. He has overseen the enlargement of NATO, the exploitation of Ukraine to weaken Russia, a military buildup in the Indo-Pacific to encircle China, and the backing of Israel’s military assaults across the Middle East. To this day, the Biden administration boasts about its imperial maneuvers, even with the knowledge that a far more dangerous Trump administration will soon be in a position to exploit U.S. imperial power for its own purposes. 'I think we’ve done remarkable things,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin marveled on November 7, two days after the election. 'We were able to manage challenges and resources—and I think that put us in a pretty good place.' Rebooting the Empire When President Biden first entered office in January 2021, one of his top priorities was to restore the global American empire from the chaos of the first Trump administration. Seizing upon the imperial trope of the United States as an organizer of the international system, Biden spoke about the need for the United States to restore order to a chaotic world. 'We are the organizing principle for the rest of the world,' Biden said in 2022. Despite some initial failures, including the collapse of the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan, the Biden administration achieved many of its imperial goals, such as the revitalization of U.S. alliances, a major strategic advantage of the United States over its rivals. Trump has repeatedly asserted that the United States is a nation in decline, seizing upon President Biden’s cognitive decline and some of his imperial failures to insist that the United States is no longer respected. Soon, however, he will find himself in a position to lead a resurgent empire. After all, the Biden administration spent the past four years rebooting the American empire, bolstering U.S. imperial power while making some its most brazen moves in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East. The Transatlantic System The Biden administration has significantly reinforced U.S. power in Europe. Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has posed a major challenge to the U.S.-led transatlantic system, the Biden administration has turned the situation to its advantage. Since the start of the Russian invasion, the Biden administration has worked to enlarge and empower NATO, bringing more countries into the alliance while increasing its spending on military operations. There are now more than 100,000 U.S. soldiersstationed across Europe, the largest number since the mid-2000s. The Biden administration has also taken advantage of the war to weaken Russia. By arming the Ukrainian resistance and imposing powerful sanctions on the Russian economy, the United States has led a concerted effort to entangle Russia in a quagmire. The administration’s basic approach has been to provide Ukraine with enough military assistance to hold its positions against Russia but not enough to push Russia out of the country. According to Austin, the primary reason why Ukrainian soldiers have been able to keep fighting is 'because we have provided them the security assistance to be able to do it.' Despite the approximately one million casualties on both sides, administration officials have insisted upon maintaining their approach, prioritizing their goal of making the war into a strategic failure for Russia over the ideal of safeguarding the security and sovereignty of Ukraine. 'What we’ve witnessed and I think what the world has witnessed is a declining superpower in Russia making one of its last-ditch unlawful efforts to go in and seize territory,' State Department official Richard Verma said in September. 'This is really a declining power in so many ways and frankly not a very effective military power.' The Transpacific System While the Biden administration has strengthened the U.S. position in Europe, it has also reinforced the U.S. position in the Indo-Pacific. Even as China has pushed back against the U.S.-led transpacific system, especially in the South China Sea, the United States has strengthened many of its advantages over China. One of the Biden administration’s major moves has been to build out the U.S. hub-and-spoke model, the U.S.-led imperial structure that keeps the United States positioned as the dominant hub of the Pacific. Not only has the administration fortified the spokes, or the U.S. allies and partners that encircle China, but it has facilitated multilateral cooperation among the spokes, mainly by working through the Quad and other regional groupings. In a related move, the Biden administration has intensified U.S. military operations across the region. An estimated 375,000 U.S. soldiers and civilian personnel now operate across the Indo-Pacific, forming the highest concentration of U.S. military service members in a region that extends beyond the United States. 'In the Indo-Pacific, I think we are seeing a resurgent United States,' Defense Department official Ely Ratner commented last year. Complementing its military moves, the Biden administration has bolstered U.S. economic power. As it has worked to decouple China from multiple sectors of the U.S. economy, it has spearheaded the formation of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which reinforces the U.S. position as the center of economic power in the Pacific. 'Contrary to the predictions that the PRC would overtake the United States in GDP either in this decade or the next, since President Biden took office, the United States has more than doubled our lead,' National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan boasted in October. The Middle East Of all the signs of a resurgent American empire, however, perhaps none is more telling than U.S. action in the Middle East. Over the past year, the Biden administration has made it clear that the United States is more capable than ever to spread havoc and destruction across the region. Since Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attack against Israel, the Biden administration has openly backed Israel’s military assaults across the Middle East, all with little consequence for the United States. The Arab states in the region may have once countered Israel by going to war or organizing oil embargoes against the United States, but they have done little to deter the United States from backing Israel’s military operations. In fact, the Arab states are now more likely to come to Israel’s defense, just as they did when they helped Israel counter Iran’s missile attacks in April and October. The Biden administration may sometimes criticize Israel for how it has conducted its military operations, especially given the fact that Israel has laid waste to Gaza, but through it all, administration officials have been quietly satisfied with how they have enabled Israel to conduct military operations without facing any major retaliation. The Biden administration’s imperial management of the region demonstrates that the United States is now so powerful that it can unleash its strategic asset on the Middle East without having to engage in a wider war. 'I think we’ve done a magnificent job there,' Austin mused earlier this month, taking pride in U.S. imperial achievements while displaying little concern for the people of Gaza or the Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas. The Future under Trump As the Biden administration has recharged the American empire, it has never stopped to question its actions. Not even internal dissent within the State Department and other federal agencies over the administration’s complicity in the destruction of Gaza has led to any kind of reckoning over the manner in which it has employed imperial violence around the world. Perhaps most telling has been the Biden administration’s response to charges that Trump is a fascist. Top administration officials have agreed with the assessments, some made by leading scholars of fascism and others issued by former high-level officials in the first Trump administration. But leaders in the Biden administration have never questioned their belief that they must do everything they can to strengthen the U.S. empire. Rather than considering what it would mean for a fascist to take control of the most powerful empire in the world, the Biden administration has spent more time considering how to ensure the empire’s survival. In recent months, one of its top priorities has been to 'Trump-proof' the empire, meaning that administration officials are searching for ways to ensure that U.S. imperial structures survive the chaos of a second Trump presidency. Now that Trump’s re-election is here, however, the Biden administration is facing a far more disturbing reality. President Biden’s legacy will be the handover of a resurgent American empire to 'the most dangerous person' in America, all with dire implications not just for the people who are targets of Trump’s wrath but for the many people around the world who are victims of U.S. imperial practices.

Myanmar’s Rare Earth Revolution: A Geopolitical Gamechanger – OpE...	As President-elect Donald Trump assembles his new administration, a complex geopolitical chess game is unfolding in Myanmar. The intersection of rare earth minerals, a protracted civil war, and shifting global alliances has created a perfect storm that demands immediate attention from Washington. This situation not only presents a critical foreign policy challenge but also offers a unique opportunity to reshape the balance of power in Southeast Asia. Recent developments have dramatically altered the landscape of Myanmar's rare earth industry and its global impact. Myanmar has emerged as the world's largest supplier of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), surpassing even China in exports. Last year, Myanmar exported approximately 50,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides (REOs) from ion-adsorption clays to China, far exceeding China's domestic IAC mining quota of 19,000 tons. This positions Myanmar as the leading global exporter of heavy REOs, with its exports accounting for as much as 50% of the global heavy rare earths supply. The situation has been further complicated by recent events in Myanmar's ongoing civil war. The opposition forces in Myanmar have made remarkable gains throughout the country, particularly in areas controlled by ethnic armed organizations. Operation 1027, launched in October 2023 by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, marked a turning point in the conflict. This coordinated offensive saw resistance forces capture over 500 military outposts and several key towns, dealing a severe blow to the military junta's control and morale. In a significant development, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) seized control of the country's rare earth mining region in mid-October 2024. The KIA took over a leading mining center that includes production sites in Pang War, Chipwi, Phimaw, and Hsawlaw. This takeover has effectively halted mining operations, disrupting the global supply chain and prompting China to impose a trade embargo on Myanmar. The National Unity Government, an anti-junta body that oversees many of the newer civilian groups, claims that junta opponents now control 60% of the country. While this control remains largely peripheral, the resistance's success has been unprecedented. The junta faces a range of serious problems, including declining morale, defections, a failure to recruit enough people to keep the army's size stable, and terrible conditions for soldiers. China's role in this conflict is crucial and complex. While China controls nearly 90% of global rare earth processing capacity, it has effectively outsourced much of its extraction to Myanmar. Beijing has consistently promoted sham elections and forced ceasefires that ultimately benefit the military junta. However, China's approach is primarily driven by its strategic interests, including access to Myanmar's natural resources and its crucial geographic position for China's Belt and Road Initiative with ocean access from landlocked western China. Given these developments, it is imperative for the United States to seize this moment and increase its support for Myanmar's resistance rather than making unsustainable deals with the military junta like China is doing. The reasons are compelling, ranging from advancing democracy to securing strategic geopolitical gains and addressing humanitarian imperatives. President-elect Trump's recent cabinet nominations signal a hardening stance on China and a renewed focus on securing America's supply chains. Senator Marco Rubio, the incoming Secretary of State, has long been a vocal critic of China's dominance in the rare earth market. He was also a staunch advocate for democracy in Burma. Senator Marco Rubio has deep concerns about China's control of the world's rare earth supply and wrote several articles and introduced legislations about rare earths and China. Links to these are provided in the references following the article. Representative Michael Waltz, set to become National Security Adviser, brings his military background as a Green Beret veteran and hawkish views on China to the table. Waltz's appointment suggests a continued focus on countering Chinese influence. Representative Mike Waltz has been a vocal and active opponent of China across multiple fronts. As a member of the House China Task Force, he has proposed legislation to reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese minerals and protect American universities from espionage. Waltz has consistently criticized China's control over critical supply chains, its military expansion, and investments in U.S. industries. He has condemned China's human rights abuses, called for a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, and described the U.S.-China relationship as a 'cold war.' Waltz's actions and statements reflect a strong stance against China's growing influence, advocating for policies that prioritize countering the China threat in U.S. foreign policy. Representative Elise Stefanik, nominated as UN Ambassador, rounds out a foreign policy team that seems poised to challenge the status quo. She is the No. 4 House Republican and a staunch Trump ally. She is in the Congressional Chinese Task Force, the armed forces committee and the intelligence committee. Representative Elise Stefanik has taken numerous legislative actions against China, focusing on national security, economic concerns, and human rights. She has introduced bills like the 'Confronting CCP Human Rights Abusers Act' to sanction entities involved in human rights abuses, the 'End College Chinese Communist Partnerships Act' to limit Chinese influence in American universities, and the 'Countering CCP Drones Act' to prohibit Chinese drone operations on U.S. communications infrastructure. Stefanik has also co-sponsored legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese military-affiliated companies and worked to remove Confucius Institutes from U.S. universities. Additionally, she has been involved in efforts to protect American patient data from Chinese biotechnology companies and has advocated for transparency in agreements with China, particularly regarding the WHO. In the Senate, John Thune from South Dakota has been elected as the new Senate Republican leader, succeeding Mitch McConnell. This position is crucial as it will involve working closely with the incoming Trump administration on legislative matters, including foreign policy initiatives. Senator John Thune has taken several actions against China. He co-introduced a bipartisan resolution with Senator Angus King to challenge China's self-designation as a developing country at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This resolution aims to reform WTO rules to prevent economically advanced countries like China from exploiting developing country status for unfair trade advantages. Thune has also advocated for strengthening U.S. national security and economic competitiveness to counter China's influence. He emphasizes the importance of passing timely defense authorization bills, investing in military capabilities, and developing a robust trade policy to compete with China's growing economic and strategic influence. Additionally, Thune supports initiatives to reduce U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals and energy resources. This new administration has an opportunity to set a new course – one that secures America's technological future while also championing sustainable practices and human rights. The window of opportunity for impactful U.S. involvement in Myanmar is now. By supporting Myanmar's Spring Revolution, the United States can reaffirm its commitment to democracy, gain strategic advantages in a crucial region, and potentially reshape the geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. As we enter what Rubio calls 'an era of pragmatic foreign policy,' this pragmatism must extend to addressing the complex situation in Myanmar, balancing strategic interests with ethical considerations and long-term regional stability. The time for decisive action is now – the U.S. must not miss this historic opportunity to make a significant impact in Myanmar and beyond, while also securing its own interests in the critical rare earth mineral supply chain. Supporting the resistance, rather than making deals with a weakening military junta, is not just the right thing to do – it's the smart thing to do for America's long-term strategic interests.

Robert Reich: Matt Gaetz As AG Would Be Laughable If It Weren’t S...	President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as America’s next attorney general. This would be laughable were it not so utterly dangerous. Gaetz as attorney general would all but guarantee that Trump weaponizes the Justice Department against his enemies — past, present, and future. Ever since Trump was first indicted, Gaetz has been defending him — alleging that the prosecutions of Trump were politically motivated, that Joe Biden was behind them, charging the Biden administration with vindictiveness toward Trump, and asserting that Trump would have every right to engage in similar vengeance toward Trump’s political enemies. In making these bogus claims, Gaetz has often used identical language to Trump’s wildly partisan and incendiary claims. I worked in the Justice Department in the years following Richard Nixon’s attempt to use the department to prosecute and intimidate Nixon’s enemies. To restore faith and trust in the department, President Gerald Ford appointed Edward Levi as attorney general. Before his appointment, Levi had been dean of the University of Chicago Law School and president of the University of Chicago. One of Levi’s most important accomplishments was to insulate the Department of Justice from political interference by establishing a set of rules that prevented the White House from privately contacting an attorney general or any other Justice Department officials. How far we’ve fallen. Gaetz, a 42-year-old congressman from Florida, has zero qualifications for being the highest law enforcement official in the land. He has never been a government attorney, never been a judge, never taught law or burnished his legal standing in any way. Quite the contrary. Gaetz is now under investigation by the House Ethics Committee in connection with a sex-trafficking scandal. (The Justice Department investigated Gaetz for his alleged involvement with a girl who was 17 at the time to determine if he paid for sex in violation of federal sex-trafficking laws, but it closed the investigation last year after career prosecutors were reportedly unsure about the credibility of two central witnesses.) If confirmed, Gaetz would lead the Justice Department’s more than 100,000 employees at a time when Trump’s allies are demanding a purge of career DOJ staffers who may have opposed some of Trump’s efforts during his first term or worked on cases involving Trump or his supporters. Gaetz has defended Trump at every turn, arguing that Trump has never violated any federal laws. Gaetz voted with about 150 of his Republican colleagues to overturn Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. He also participated in what federal prosecutors have characterized as a rehearsal for 'Stop the Steal' efforts — protesting the results of a hotly contested Senate race in Florida with members of the Proud Boys and other Trump loyalists. After Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Gaetz was defiant. 'We’re ashamed of nothing,' he said publicly. In other words, nominating Gaetz to be attorney general is only slightly less absurd than nominating Vladimir Putin to be secretary of defense. The key question is whether Gaetz can be confirmed by a Republican Senate. Two key Republican moderates have already indicated they would likely vote against him. Senator Susan Collins said she was 'shocked' by the nomination; Senator Lisa Murkowski said he was not a serious contender for the job. But Senator Lindsey Graham — currently the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a reliable weather vane for the unscrupulous — said he was surprised Trump picked Gaetz, whom he called 'clever,' and predicted Gaetz would face 'tough questions' at his confirmation hearing. But Graham also said he was inclined to support presidential appointments. Gaetz’s nomination is really a test by Trump of how far he can go intimidating, bullying, and generating fear among Senate Republicans. No Senate Democrat will vote for Gaetz, so Trump and his allies are viewing the Gaetz nomination as a test of loyalty to Trump. This will be the clearest signal yet of whether Republican senators are ready to do Trump’s bidding on all sorts of sensitive issues, including cutting back Social Security and giving Putin what he wants in Ukraine. If Trump can get 51 votes for Gaetz, he can get a Senate majority for just about anything Trump wants to do.

What Should President Trump Do Once He’s In Office? – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen A few months ago I wrote a piece for FEE on Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei. Milei took on the presidency of Argentina with a particularly pressing challenge: government overspending was driving out-of-control money creation and its by-product—inflation. Milei’s goal was explicit. He promised to cut government largesse. In my article, I argued that his success in doing so would be entirely dependent on his ability to cut down the bureaucracy. To quote the article: Bureaus have no incentive to stop unsustainable spending habits like we have seen in Argentina. If anything, their existence requires them to prevent reforms that take from their agendas and budgets. There is still work to be done. As noted at the beginning of the piece, this is really just the first step in eliminating the bureaucratic bloat. But it is a necessary first step. In the United States, we find ourselves in a less urgent situation. Inflation has caused serious distress and harm for some, but our inflation rate is nowhere near the likes of Argentina. However, it is clear that the US is trending in the wrong direction with respect to government spending. The growth of the United States debt accelerated after Covid and is reaching dizzying levels. If the United States is unable to rein in spending, a future characterized by hyperinflation the likes of Argentina seems likely. What should the newly elected President Trump do to prevent this? To answer this question, we’re going to borrow wisdom from a group of thinkers dubbed the Late Scholastics. This was a group of Catholic thinkers from the 16th and 17th centuries who advised royalty and businessmen in their economic dealings. Much of what I write here will be drawn from Faith and Liberty: The Economic Thought of the Late Scholastics by Alejandro A. Chafuen. Although the Scholastics were situated in the setting of monarchy, their proposals for reining in government over-spending were targeted at the executive, and, in that sense, their advice is entirely applicable to the US president. The Late Scholastics coalesced around three proposals. Let’s look at each one. Proposal 1: Canning the Court First, Late Scholastic scholars advised monarchs to shrink the size of their 'courts.' The court was a group of the executive’s advisors, similar to our president’s cabinet today. For this advice on shrinking the court, we can turn to Late Scholastic thinker Pedro Fernández Navarrete. Chafuen highlights that Navarrete did not merely recommend stopping the growth of the court; he believed in actively shrinking it. In Navarrete’s words: …[it is not sufficient] to prevent future enlargement of the royal court. We need to clean it up and purge it of its present excess of hangers-on. People may say that this is an extreme suggestion since the court supports so many people, but the disease has become so grave and so evident that we have no excuse not to employ the remedy. These 'hangers-on' in the court generated demand for the king to increase spending, but added very little. As a result, spending grew, and taxes and currency debasement along with it. Our modern bureaucrats are no different. Chafuen points out how Navarrete compares this to bloodletting. You may lose some good blood (good bureaucrats), but it is necessary to do so in order to lose the bad blood (bad bureaucrats). Similar to Milei, if Trump is serious about dealing with our debt, cutting the bureaucratic fat should be the first goal on the table. It seemed unlikely that we would have gotten this sort of policy from the left. Joe Biden drew controversy recently by claiming that Donald Trump should be locked up… politically (whatever that means). In his comments which immediately preceded this claim, Biden was lamenting Trump’s Supreme Court immunity decision and, right before that, he expressed worry about Trump cutting bureaucracy. President Biden said of Trump, 'He is talking about doing away with the entire Department of Education… This is the guy who also wants to replace every civil servant—every single one.' It seems that removing executive bureaucracies and bureaucrats would be within the rights of the executive, but, if Biden is any indication, we wouldn’t have seen a President Harris exercising that authority. Trump, as of now, seems poised to do this. He has already said he is working on closing up the Department of Education in Washington DC (though it’s unclear if he is talking about ending the department entirely or just reorganizing and relocating it). If Trump follows through on this promise, made by many-a-republican before him, it will be a sign he is taking this advice seriously. Proposal 2: Sacrificing Subsidies The second proposal is a little more straightforward but still important. Late Scholastic thinker Juan de Mariana argued that the king should cut back on subsidizing private interests. Chafuen chronicles Mariana’s list of worries which included spending on 'public prizes… pensions, benefits, and offices.' The subsidization of pensions and retirement in general is not a foreign worry for the US. A significant amount of tax revenue goes to keeping Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid systems afloat. Over one-fifth of government spending goes to Social Security. The program has grown so expensive that within the next two decades it will run out of money, forcing either a benefit decrease or a tax increase. This is to say nothing of the corporate bailouts and Covid stimulus subsidies we’ve come to accept over the last few years. Meanwhile, many are agitating for more bailouts in the form of loan forgiveness of various kinds. Finally, private subsidies are given in large amounts to the industry we’ll discuss in our last proposal: the military-industrial complex. Proposal 3: Pursuing Peace The final proposal we’ll cover, also from Mariana, is that the king should stop pursuing 'unnecessary wars and nonessential enterprises.' It’s long been recognized that 'war is the health of the state.' War funnels private tax dollars to special interest groups, who in return support hawkish politicians. Wars also create a large class of bureaucrats who, as we discussed, generate more demand for foreign intervention. The United States has nearly 800 military bases across the world. The two decades of military intervention that followed the 9/11 attacks have cost the US an estimated $9 trillion. That’s more than a quarter of our national debt. The common theme throughout history is that great military powers tend to over-extend their empires. This over-extension both generates multiple fronts of conflict and creates resource stresses at home which are by and large borne by the citizens. President John Quincy Adams (son of founding father John Adams) summed up America’s commitment to freedom and to the citizenry well in a speech to the US House in 1821: Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions, and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. If Trump is serious about tackling our spending problem, he needs to get serious about the modern tendency of spending our resources searching for, fighting, and even creating monsters abroad. No country can afford to be the policeman for all other countries, nor is such a job compatible with America’s foundational liberal values. It’s my hope that Trump will finally break the cycle of ignoring our looming debt issues. The proposals of the Late Scholastics would be a great place to start.

How Targeting UN Could Harm Israel’s Own Interests – OpEd	The recent Israeli measures against the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)—including two controversial bills to ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli territory and areas under Israel’s control—are certainly a distressing development. In the early years of Israel’s statehood, after its 1948 establishment, Israel’s UN membership was held up for two years due to unresolved questions around the status of displaced Palestinians. The United Nations was still quite young when it passed Resolution 194, which recognized the rights of Palestinian refugees to return home and receive compensation for their losses—a commitment that has influenced rounds of talks over the decades. Since then, this resolution has been a pivotal point in discussions between Palestinians and Israelis. Palestinians have continued to demand that Israel acknowledge its role in this forced displacement and provide compensation, seeing it not only as a matter of historical fact but as an overdue moral obligation. Today, Israel’s treatment of UNRWA reflects the chronic tension between its own state objectives and a humanitarian question the UN has never abandoned. Israel’s recent actions raise pricking questions about its commitment to that international consensus and the lingering need for accountability in this conflict. The United States, in order to address the dire conditions faced by Palestinian refugees along Israel’s borders, played a major role in establishing UNRWA in 1950. This agency, originally backed by substantial American funding, became a critical lifeline for Palestinian refugees across the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, continuously serving a population that is now almost six million. Since its inception, UNRWA has remained a purely humanitarian outfit in every sense, focused solely on delivering essential services such as education, food, medical care, and fuel to a community facing immense hardship. However, this lifeline faced a serious setback during the Trump administration, which squeezed U.S. contributions. Biden, due to mounting pressure from pro-Israel factions in Congress, partly upheld this a stance . The funding gap has emboldened Israel’s right-wing extremist leaders to diminish the significance of the Palestinian refugee crisis in global discourse. Obviously, without UNRWA, Palestinians risk losing their most vital support system, which provides stability in an otherwise precarious situation. Although UNRWA operates strictly within its UN mandate, its mere presence has become a focal point in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Over the years, Israel’s supporters have worked to erode the agency’s reputation, urging major contributors to withhold funding or, in some cases, presenting dubious claims about UNRWA’s operations. The accusation that UNRWA staff were somehow complicit in Hamas’ attacks on October 7 was promptly investigated by a special UN committee. The findings were unequivocal: no evidence linked UNRWA staff to any wrongdoing. The inquiry exposed and rebutted Israel’s baseless allegations. The UN inquiry divulged that Israel hadn’t provided names or credible information to substantiate these allegations. In fact, UNRWA had been requesting such details from Israel since 2011, with no response. This episode has exposed the continued challenges faced by UNRWA in executing its mandate amidst politicized pressure from Israel. In a stunning turn of events on October 28, Israel’s Knesset overwhelmingly voted to ban the UNRWA from operating within Israel, with 92 out of 120 members supporting the move. In a second measure, 87 Knesset members also approved a ban on Israeli state authorities interacting with UNRWA, effectively hobbling its capacity to operate in the Occupied Territories. This week, foreign ministers from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the UK warned of the 'devastating consequences' this ban could unleash across the West Bank and Gaza. Shortly before this, in another blatant display of brutal aggression, Israeli authorities seized the land in East Jerusalem housing UNRWA’s headquarters, reportedly to construct 1,440 new settlement units. This move contravenes international law. The timing and audacity of these actions have left the international community grappling with a troubling reality. Israel’s plans to dismantle the very mechanisms designed to support and assist vulnerable Palestinians will not only aggravate the humanitarian crisis but also deepen the operational problems for the agency. In choosing to silence the very agency tasked with aiding displaced Palestinians, Israel is seriously damaging its own legitimacy on the global stage. In so doing, Israel is actually strengthening the case of those who question that very legitimacy. Ironically, in attempting to erase the presence of Palestinian refugees from its landscape, Israel’s actions could very well enhance the visibility of that issue.

Middle East Reacts To Trump’s Dalliance With Zionism – OpEd	The election victory of Donald Trump in the November 5 election is being perceived in the West Asian region with growing anxiety as presaging the US aligning one hundred percent with the Zionist project for Greater Israel. Although Trump has kept out vociferous neocons from his government positions, the same cannot be said for pro-Zionist figures. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims he has spoken three times with Trump already since the election and they 'see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components.' The 'components' implies that Netanyahu hopes to get a blank cheque from Trump to accelerate the ethnic cleansing in Gaza, for annexation of West Bank, violent reprisals against Palestinians and, most important, to carry the war right into Iranian territory. Three events in as many days this week show the first signs of a backlash building up. On Monday, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei gave Tehran’s first official reaction to Trump’s election victory. Baqaei took a nuanced line saying, 'What matters to us in this region is the United States’ actual behaviour and policies regarding Iran and the broader West Asia.' Notably, Baqaei expressed 'cautious optimism that the new [Trump] administration might adopt a more peace-oriented approach, reduce regional hostilities, and uphold its commitments.' (Tehran Times) Baqaei also refuted the recent allegation by Washington that Iran was involved in plots to assassinate Trump. He called the Biden Administration’s allegation as 'nothing more than an attempt to sabotage relations' between Tehran and Washington by 'laying traps to complicate the path for the next administration.' Baqaei also held out an assurance to the incoming US administration that Tehran firmly adheres to a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes. He announced that Rafael Grossi, head of International Atomic Energy (IAEA) was due to arrive in Tehran on Wednesday night. Taken together, Baqaei’s remarks suggest that Iran hopes there’s still daylight possible between Trump and Netanyahu. The clincher here would have been the remark that Trump slipped into his victory speechwith great deliberation on November 6 that 'I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars.' Trump was on record during his election campaign that 'I don’t want to do damage to Iran but they cannot have nuclear weapons.' Tehran’s consultations with Grossi responds to Trump’s concern. This is smart thinking. Iran’s non-provocative stance would mean there is no alibi for attacking Iran. That said, however, the 'known unknown' still remains — namely, Iran’s retaliation to the Israeli attack on October 26. On November 2, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a video released by Iranian state media, promised 'a crushing response' to Israeli attack. Conceivably, the period till January 20 when Trump is sworn in, is going to be critical. Meanwhile, this week witnessed that Iran and Saudi Arabia have given verve to their detente, which is now manifesting as Riyadh’s solidarity and open support for Iran in its growing confrontation with Israel. Amidst the growing tensions in the region, the chief of staff of Saudi Arabia’s armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, visited Tehran on November 10 and met with his Iranian counterpart General Mohammad Bagheri. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke on the phonewith Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone in the context of a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) – Arab League in Riyadh on November 11-12. Iran has extended an invitation to MbS to visit Tehran! Two hugely significant highlights of the Riyadh summit have been, first, the Saudi prince’s inaugural address where he warned Israel against hitting Iran. This marked a historic turn by Riyadh toward Tehran-Israeli conflict, and away from US-supported normalisation with Jerusalem. MbS told the summit that the international community should oblige Israel 'to respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands.' Again, Saudi Arabia accused Israel for the first time of committing 'genocide' in Gaza. MbS told the leaders who gathered in Riyadh, that the kingdom renewed 'its condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people…' Trump has been put on notice that he’s meeting a radically different geopolitical landscape in West Asia compared to his first term as president. The Trump transition team is keeping its cards close, offering NatSec Daily a boilerplate statement that Trump will take 'necessary action' to 'lead our country' and 'restore peace through strength.' But warning bells are ringing. The key pillars of Trump’s 'maximum pressure' strategy against Tehran — isolating Iran and ramping up economic pressure while maintaining a credible threat of military force as deterrent — have become wobbly. On the other hand, the massive Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1 and the colossal failure of the Israeli air strike on Iran twenty-six days later convey a loud message all across West Asia that Israel is no longer the dominant military power it used to be — and there is a new sheriff in town. Trump will have to navigate the fallout of both sides of this issue with diminished US diplomatic and geopolitical capital at his disposal. Meanwhile, Tehran is also deepening its cooperation with Russia, which adds a giant new Ukraine-sized complexity to Trump’s Iran policy. While in Eurasia, the US has allies, Trump is navigating in West Asia pretty much alone. The US’ stark isolation comes home dramatically by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s announcement on Wednesday that Turkey, a NATO member country, has severed all ties with Israel. Erdogan disclosed this to journalists aboard his plane after visiting Saudi Arabia. A regional trend to ostracise Israel is visible now and it is destined to expand and deepen. The summit in Riyadh witnessed the African Union joining hands with the Arab League and OIC to sign a tripartite agreement on Tuesday to establish a mechanism to support the Palestinian cause, which will be coordinated through the three organisations’ secretariats as a game changer to strengthen their influence in international forums. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan noted that the three organisations will now onward speak with one voice internationally. Even as the summit concluded in Riyadh, Crown Prince Salman had a call on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin readout stated that the two leaders 'reaffirmed their commitment to continue the consistent expansion' of Russian-Saudi ties and specifically 'stressed the importance of continuing close coordination within OPEC Plus and stated the effectiveness and timeliness of the steps being taken in this format to ensure balance on the global energy market.' On the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Kremlin readout noted with satisfaction that 'the principled approaches of Russia and Saudi Arabia with regard to the Middle East settlement are essentially identical.' MbS’ initiative to re-invigorate his conversation with Putin can only be seen against the backdrop of the profound misgivings in Riyadh regarding the Trump-Netanyahu bromance and the spectre of a possible regional war haunting the region stemming out of Israel drawing encouragement from the seamless US support expected through the coming 4-year period for the Zionist cause.

West Repeating Error Of 1980s And Overrating Moscow’s Strength An...	In the 1980s, Western governments and experts overrated both the strength and likely longevity of the Soviet Union, with many assuming it would survive and perhaps even prosper over at least several decades. Now, Peter Zashev says, their successors are making a similar mistake about Putin’s Russia. In fact, the Russian scholar now at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga says, 'Putin’s Russia is weak, even very weak,' despite the bluffing Moscow has once again used with such success to convince the West otherwise (moscowtimes.ru/2024/11/12/sploshnoi-blef-i-bravada-rossiya-putina-slaba-ochen-slaba-a147419). Now just as at the end of Soviet times, Zashev says, many in the West are failing to see this and making miscalculations as a result. In reality, he continues, 'the Putin regime has many weak points, and they are not some Achilles’ heel but rather other parts of the body politic, much larger' and therefore much for likely to kick in sooner than most expect. To make his point, Zashev lists four such weak points: the absence of an ideology, Putin’s inability to gain support unless he pays for it, Putin’s constant need to display his strength which in the nature of things ultimately leads to overreaching and defeat, and an economy that looks superficially strong but in fact is riven with problems. First of all, he argues, Putin’s Russia 'simply doesn’t have an ideology. Instead, it offers a strange, unnatural and rather perverse mixture of Orthodoxy, Stalinism, anti-Americanism, militarism, Sovietism' and much else besides. What is on offer is intended to cover but in fact calls attention to the fact that 'no one loves Putin unless they are paid to do so.' To conceal that reality, Zashev continues, Putin must constantly show himself to be powerful enough to win everything he gets involved with; but at present, he can’t even defend Kursk Oblast let alone take Kyiv, he can’t defend Russia’s airports or oil dumps and everyone can see that. He will try to create situations in which he can win, but he won’t be able to. The reason is the fourth weak point of the Putin system, the economy. It is just treading water now but is falling ever further behind the rest of the world in terms of innovation and modernization. And that creates a situation in which the entire system can become unbalanced and then collapse. Zashev concludes: 'The system appears to be working so far, but the example of the USSR should remind us how easily such a system can become unbalanced and what its suddent and rapid destruction this will lead to: – and more than that, that 'the end will come much faster than we can imagine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CmXalCZp1-m4	2024-11-14T16:04:45-08:00	
How Does Marco Rubio, Trump’s Pick For Secretary Of State, See Th...	By Todd Prince and Tony Wesolowsky (RFE/RL) -- President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Senator Marco Rubio to be his top diplomat as the incoming administration prepares to navigate an increasingly perilous world, with wars raging in Europe and the Middle East and competition heating up with China in the Asia-Pacific. In choosing Rubio -- a senator known for taking a tough line on many foreign policy issues -- the president-elect is seeking someone who largely shares his views on the most pressing international topics, says Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'Rubio is someone who has ideological and political alignment with Trump on several key national-security issues like great-power competition, countering China, countering the Islamic [Republic of] Iran, and reinstating the maximum-pressure campaign,' Taleblu told RFE/RL. In a wide-ranging interview last week with media before being tapped as secretary of state, Rubio said the decades-long period of unchallenged U.S. global dominance following the collapse of the Soviet Union had ended, replaced by a new Cold War-like era. He warned that the United States can't stretch itself too thin with global commitments, saying Washington must be 'pragmatic' in its pursuits abroad. 'We're the most powerful [country], but we too have limited resources…so we have to invest both our time and our money on things that serve our core national interest,' Rubio said in a November 7 interview with EWTN, a U.S.-based cable network. Rubio, a Cuban-American, played an influential role in shaping Trump's policy on Venezuela during the latter's first term as president from 2017 to 2021. The New York Times described Rubio at the time as Trump's 'virtual secretary of state for Latin America.' The three-time Florida senator, who challenged Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, comes to the job with ample foreign policy experience, having served on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. If ultimately confirmed by the Senate, Rubio, 53, would be the first Latino to serve as secretary of state. And while Latin America will certainly be an important focus for Rubio, it will take a back seat to more pressing U.S. foreign policy concerns, namely China's global rise, Iran's threat to the Middle East, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Priority No. 1: China When it comes to demands on U.S. military, political, and financial resources, Rubio wants the focus to be on China. 'I think the future of the 21st century is going to largely be defined by what happens in the Indo-Pacific. And I think China would love for us to be bogged down in Europe in a conflict and not focused on what's happening in the Indo-Pacific,' Rubio said on November 7. Rubio, who served as a co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, has consistently advocated taking a hard line on China. He led efforts to arm Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed by Beijing. He called for direct shipments of U.S. munitions and advanced military technologies in hopes of deterring China from attacking the island. Rubio has also been vocal about Beijing's human rights record, pushed for a U.S. industrial policy to better compete with China, and backed tariffs on Chinese goods. He sought to ban imports of Chinese goods made with forced labor by Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in western China and prevent China from circumventing Trump-era tariffs by relocating production to Mexico. NATO And Ukraine Rubio has repeatedly supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in its defensive war against Russia and described Ukrainians as 'incredibly brave and strong.' In February 2022, immediately following Russia's full-scale invasion, he co-sponsored the NYET Act in the Senate, which aimed to 'bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities' and impose sanctions on Russia. However, Rubio has also said Russia's war against Ukraine has reached a 'stalemate' and 'needs to be brought to a conclusion.' He was among a minority of senators who, earlier this year, opposed a foreign-assistance bill that included $60 billion in aid for Ukraine. The bill eventually passed in April, bringing total U.S. aid to Ukraine since February 2022 to almost $175 billion -- about as much given by all of Europe combined. Rubio has highlighted that imbalance, emphasizing that Washington should push Europe to take a larger role in handling its own security issues in order to allow the United States to prioritize challenging China in the Indo-Pacific. In last week's interview with EWTN, Rubio said it was 'unrealistic' to expect the United States to approve tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine every 10 months. He said European members of NATO need to step up their contributions to the alliance. 'Every day in our own country, [we are] grappling with [the question of] how do we provide assistance to Americans, even as we have these defense requirements that we're spending a lot of money on, and these [European NATO] countries are not making that choice,' he said. While Rubio sees Russia as a threat to U.S. security and backs Ukraine's sovereignty and independence, he said Kyiv will have to negotiate an end to the war. Rubio said Russia has just too many resources at its disposal, including weapons and men, to allow it to continue the fighting despite suffering extraordinary losses. Iran: 'No Appeasement' In the Middle East, Rubio has long taken a tough stand on Iran, describing its theocratic government as a 'terrorist regime' for financing groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, both designated terrorist organizations by the United States. As a senator, he was a fierce critic of U.S. President Barack Obama's 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), which restricted Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Critics of the deal argued it empowered Iran, offering too much relief from sanctions without guarantees it wouldn't someday produce a nuclear bomb. In 2018, Trump, who was then president, pulled the United States out of the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. More recently, Rubio co-authored three bills punishing Iran that were signed into law this year. The bills authorize placing sanctions on Iranian oil exports and top Iranian leaders for human rights abuses, as well as foreign entities and governments supporting Hamas. An Iranian client, Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, triggering a regional war that threatens to engulf more states. Rubio in September criticized the Biden administration for dragging its feet on enforcing the Iranian oil sanctions, which are aimed at crippling the government's finances. It has also failed to move forward on the human rights sanctions. Depending on what the incoming administration is faced with in Iran when it takes office, analyst Taleblu says -- noting the volatile situation in the Middle East -- he would expect a Rubio-led State Department to make good on enforcement of the sanction bills. A vocal supporter of Israel, Rubio has backed the country's right to defend itself from Iranian threats. Following Tehran's missile strikes on Israel on October 1, Rubio publicly backed an asymmetrical response. Afghanistan Rubio has also taken a hard line on the Taliban, arguing the militant Islamist group should be described as a 'terrorist organization' by Washington. In March, the Florida senator introduced a bill in the Senate calling for an end to an end to U.S. aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, arguing that some of that money could end up with 'terrorist groups.' In remarks to the Senate, Rubio said, 'A Taliban-controlled Afghanistan poses a direct threat to U.S. national-security interests and to our allies in the Middle East and Central Asia.'

What To Expect From The Trump National Security Team – OpEd	By Dave Patterson When former President Donald Trump won an impressive re-election, national security wonks went wild with speculation on how Trump 47 would treat the Pentagon. The liberals portrayed the worst possible national security future, casting Trump as a tyrant who would use the active-duty military to impose his will on US citizens. Most of the gloom-and-doomers are 'never-Trumpers' and have views of little relevance. Trump Rapidly Forms National Security Staff As the Trump Defense Department transition team starts to form its slate of Pentagon and other national security staff, what amounts to a fifth column is forming inside the five-sided building. Media reports show that Trump did not calculate how divisive what he called 'the enemy within' really was. There seems to be a cadre of unnamed defense officials holding clandestine gatherings to devise ways to thwart their commander-in-chief. These people need to remember that 75 million voters repudiated their flawed point of view. News of this despicable behavior was made public in a CNN report: 'Pentagon officials are holding informal discussions about how the Department of Defense would respond if Donald Trump issues orders to deploy active-duty troops domestically and fire large swaths of apolitical staffers, defense officials told CNN … Trump’s election has also raised questions inside the Pentagon about what would happen if the president issued an unlawful order, particularly if his political appointees inside the department don’t push back.' These reports could be chalked up to chatter among those in the suggestion-making class, always a noisy minority in any administration. These comments are troubling because these voices gain prominence through the mindless echo chamber of the conventional media. To set the record straight about what presidents can do and have done, take the phrase 'how the Department of Defense would respond if Donald Trump issues orders to deploy active-duty troops domestically.' This notion is a forecast for the darkest and most malevolent intentions, unprecedented in American history. However, putting that phrase in historical context, Military.com explained past commanders-in-chief have used soldiers domestically six times. Which leads one to ask those worried about President Trump: 'Do you mean like President Abraham Lincoln using federal troops to quell the New York City draft riots? Perhaps you are talking about President Herbert Hoover when he used the US Army, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, to remove veterans who set up an encampment on Capitol Hill, or in 1967 when President Lyndon Johnson called in the 82nd and 101st Airborne units to put down ‘Detroit’s 12th Street Riot,’ or maybe you mean the use of 13,600 armed soldiers that restored order when riots erupted nationwide following the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Maybe you are referring to the Los Angeles riots when several hundred Marines restored order in 1992.' Should anyone forget, President Dwight Eisenhower deployed active-duty soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division in 1957 to escort nine black students to a newly integrated Central High School in Little Rock, AR. In each of these instances, federal military forces were used domestically because it was necessary to preserve the lives and property of US citizens. That reasoning was precisely how President-elect Trump phrased his intentions about when federal troops would be needed. However, on a more practical level, Trump administration appointees will be swimming upstream, particularly in the Pentagon, to achieve the Trump agenda. For Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) steps up to take the position. Current Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) will be Trump’s National Security Advisor. Fox News personality and veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars Pete Hegseth will be Secretary of Defense. A Non-traditional Choice Hegseth, Rubio, and Waltz will constitute the principal national security team; the most non-traditional choice is Hegseth to lead the Pentagon. However, he will have a mandate to turn the Defense Department from a den of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activists into a fighting force capable of again deterring aggressors and, if deterrence fails, to defeat any adversary soundly. Many recent assessments of the US Armed Forces have questioned whether that is possible now. Trump sees Hegseth as a no-nonsense, thoughtful leader who will bring back structure, order, and discipline to the Pentagon. Quoting Trump, The New York Times wrote, 'Pete is tough, smart, and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — our military will be great again, and America will never back down.' As the new administration nominees are announced, each has been selected to achieve the Trump agenda. Turning the massive ship of state from the path 60% of voters said is going in the wrong direction will be an immense undertaking and may be painful. However, America will be better for the effort.

The Choices That Australia Makes – OpEd	If you go to the bluff at Kings Park in Perth, Australia, you can overlook the Swan River and enjoy a remarkable view. Across the bay, there is a phalanx of steel and glass buildings that rise to the skies. Each of these buildings carries a sign that glistens in the sharp sun: BHP, Rio Tinto, Chevron, Deloitte, and others. Kings Park no longer survives merely with the patronage of the British King, who continues to claim sovereignty over Australia. Part of it is now named Rio Tinto Kings Park, needing the corporate profits from this enormous mining company to sustain its charms. Down one of the avenues of the park there are trees set apart by a few meters, and at the base of these trees are small markers for dead soldiers from past wars; these are not graves but remembrances that are crowned by Australian flags. The park brings together the three crucial pieces of Western Australia, this province of which Perth is the capital which is the size of Western Europe: the British monarchy, the mining companies and its affiliates, and the role of the military. Of Kings A few days before I arrived in Canberra, an aboriginal senator, Lidia Thorpe, interrupted the celebration of King Charles III to say, 'You are not my king. This is not your land.' It was a powerful demonstration against the treatment of Australia ever since the arrival of English ships to the country’s east in January 1788. In fact, the British crown does claim title to the entirety of the Australian landmass. King Charles III is head of the 56-country Commonwealth and the total land area of the Commonwealth takes up 21 percent of the world’s total land. It is quite remarkable to realize that King Charles III is nominally in charge of merely 22 percent less than Queen Victoria (1819-1901). The day after Senator Thorpe’s statement, a group of aboriginal leaders met with King Charles III to discuss the theme of 'sovereignty.' In Sydney, Elder Allan Murray of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council welcomed the King to Gadigal land and said, 'We’ve got stories to tell, and I think you witnessed that story yesterday in Canberra. But the story is unwavering, and we’ve got a long way to achieve what we want to achieve and that’s our own sovereignty.' When Captain James Cook (1770) and Captain Arthur Phillip (1788) arrived on this Gadigal land, they were met by people who had lived in the area for tens of thousands of years. In 1789, a smallpox epidemic brought by the British killed 53 percent of the Gadigal, and eventually—through violence—they reduced the population to three in 1791. It is accurate, then, for Elder Murray to have said to the press after King Charles III left that 'The Union Jack was put on our land without our consent. We’ve been ignored.' What remained were barrangal dyara(skin and bones, as the Gadigal would have said). Given the value of the land in Sydney, the Gadigal clan would today be one of the richest groups in the world. But apart from a few descendants who do not have title to the land, the ghosts of the ancestors walk these streets. Of Minerals Australia is one of the widest countries in the world, with a large desert in its middle section. Underneath its soil, which has been walked on by a range of Aboriginal communities for tens of thousands of years, is wealth that is estimated to be $19.9 trillion. This estimate includes the country’s holdings of coal, copper, iron ore, gold, uranium, and rare earth elements. In 2022, Australia’s mining companies—which are also some of the largest in the world—extracted at least 27 minerals from the subsoil, including lithium (Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium, annually providing 52 percent of the global market’s lithium). On May 24, 2020, Rio Tinto’s engineers and workers blew up a cave in the Pilbara area of Western Australia to expand their Brockman 4 iron ore mine. The cave in the Juukan Gorge had been used by the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people for 46,000 years and had been kept by them as a community treasure. In 2013, Rio Tinto approached the Western Australian government to seek an exemption to destroy the cave and to extend the mine. They received this exemption based on a law called the Aboriginal Heritage Act of 1972, which had been drafted to favor mining companies. Rio Tinto, with substantial operations in Western Australia and around the world, has a market capitalization of $105.7 billion, making it—after BHP (market cap of $135.5)—the second largest minerals company in the world (both Rio Tinto and BHP are headquartered in Melbourne). Hastily, BHP began to reconsider its permission to destroy 40 cultural sites for its South Flank iron mine extension in the Pilbara region (and after its investigation and conversation with the Banjima community) decided to save 10 sites. Craig and Monique Oobagooma live in the northernmost homestead in Australia near the Robinson River. They are part of the Wanjina Wunggurr, whose lands are now used for the extraction of uranium and other metals and minerals. The uranium mines in the north are owned and operated by Paladin Energy, another Perth-based mining company that also owns mines in Malawi and Namibia. There is also a large military base in nearby Yampi. Craig told me that when he walks his land, he can dig beneath the soil and find pink diamonds. But, he says, he puts them back. 'They are sacred stones,' he says. Some parts of the land can be used for the betterment of his family, but not all of it. Not the sacred stones. And not the ancestral sites, of which there are only a few that remain. Of Militaries In 2023, the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom signed an agreement to preserve 'critical minerals' for their own development and security. Such an agreement is part of the New Cold War against China, to ensure that it does not directly own the 'critical minerals.' Between 2022 and 2023, Chinese investment in mining decreased from AU$1809 million to AU$34 million. Meanwhile, Australian investment in building military infrastructure for the United States has increased dramatically, with the Australian government expanding the Tindal air base in Darwin (Northern Territory) to hold U.S. B-1 and B-52 nuclear bombers, expanding the submarine docking stations along the coastline of Western Australia, and expanding the Exmouth submarine and deep space communications facility. All of this is part of Australia’s historically high defense budget of $37 billion. In Sydney, near the Central Train station, I met Euranga, who lived in a tunnel which he had painted with the history of the Aboriginal peoples of Eora (Sydney). He had been part of the Stolen Generation, one in three Aboriginal children stolen from their families and raised in boarding schools. The school hurt his spirit, he told me. 'This is our land, but it is also not our land,' he said. Beneath the land is wealth, but it is being drained away by private mining companies and for the purposes of military force. The old train station nearby looks forlorn. There is no high-speed rail in vast Australia. Such a better way to spend its precious resources, as Euranga indicated in his paintings: embrace the worlds of the Aboriginal communities who have been so harshly displaced and build infrastructure for people rather than for wars.

Abolish The Department Of Homeland Security – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken The Trump transition team on Wednesday announced that he is nominating South Dakota governor Kristi Noem as the next head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In the coming weeks, we’ll hear a lot about Noem’s personal politics and origins. We’ll also hear about how the DHS is, as the AP puts it, 'one of the biggest government agencies that will be integral to his vow to secure the border and carry out a massive deportation operation.' Unfortunately, all this misses the most important point about the DHS which is that the DHS was invented in 2002 to justify more government spending, to reward political allies, and to influence local governments with federal grants. For voters who supported Trump because they thought a Trump presidency might actually reduce government waste, they should now be asking why Trump is appointing any new DHS head at all. The only thing Trump should do with the DHS is abolish it. For younger readers, or people with terrible memories, this might sound radical or extreme. But, I can assure you, dear reader, that the United States somehow managed to get along for more than 225 years before this Department was created twenty-two years ago by Congress and the Bush Administration. Much of what the Department does today was not new in 2002, of course. The federal government already had a border patrol, and it already collected tariffs on imports. The Coast Guard was alive and well. The Secret Service already existed, as did various agencies related to nuclear energy and the inspection of agricultural projects. But, the DHS has always been more than just a reorganization of existing agencies. The DHS has overseen new slush funds for domestic police departments. It is the DHS that has largely facilitated the militarization of local police forces. As Wired put it in 2020, 'the Homeland Security Grant Program has funneled billions of dollars to law enforcement agencies to acquire military-grade equipment.' Nonetheless, the creation of the DHS has done nothing to make the border more secure, or to facilitate the enforcement of tariffs. The DHS has never been necessary to patrol US coastal waters. Rather, federal bureaucrats and elected officials pursued the creation of this new enormous government department for political reasons. The DHS was created to be a cabinet-level agency, and the thing about cabinet-level status is that the move makes it easier for the bureaucrats in charge of the agencies to politically agitate for more government spending in their favor, and to push bigger government in general. It’s no coincidence that as the US government has grown ever larger and more intrusive, so has the number of cabinet-level agencies. So, now we have the EPA, the SBA, and the departments of HUD, Energy, and Education all provided with more direct access to the president and the media. Everything they do is deemed 'essential.' Everything they do, we’re told, is a matter of national importance. DHS is no different. When the 9/11 attacks occurred, they exposed the sheer incompetence, laziness, and inefficiency of government security and defense organizations. Year after year, hundreds of billions of dollars were poured into these organizations — in addition to the countless billions spent on the Pentagon. But when they were shown to be asleep at the switch, what happened? Rather than have their budgets cut, and senior officials fired in droves — as should have happened — George W. Bush and his cronies decided that what the federal government really needed was a new department into which billions more in taxpayer money could be poured. The was politically important in the sense that making DHS a department made it easier to call for every more funding for its constituent agencies. It has certainly worked. Prior to the creation of the DHS, 'homeland security' functions were rarely funded at levels exceeding 20 billion dollars per year. Since 2002, though, federal spending on these functions—now consolidated into the DHS—has soared. Since 2001, the total budget for these activities has nearly tripled, rising from $28 billion in 2001 to $112 billion in 2024. (That’s in inflation-adjusted 2023 dollars.) Since the Cold War ended, by the way, spending on so-called homeland security has increased by more than six-fold. Since 2001, has it really become almost three times more expensive—in inflation adjusted terms, mind you—to patrol the border, to collect tariffs, and to check luggage for guns at the airport? It is difficult to see how. What we do know is that the DHS has become an important pass-through for government largesse. Some of this goes to local governments, and these dollars give the federal government more power by providing yet another carrot the feds can hold out to local politicians. Billions more goes into the FEMA black hole which spends prodigiously on federal agents who use DHS dollars as a means of punishing their political opponents. While the Department was created in response to the 9/11 attacks, the Department does nothing to address anything like a 9/11-style attack. All the agencies that were supposed to provide intelligence on such attacks — the FBI for instance, which failed miserably on 9/11 — already exist in other departments and continue to enjoy huge budgets. Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration — an agency that has never caught a single terrorist—has managed to smuggle at least $100 million worth of cocaine. Once upon a time, 'homeland security' was supposed to be the job of the Department of Defense. but, it seems the Pentagon has been too busy in Ukraine or Iraq to trouble itself with the defense of the borders and airspace of the United States. In spite of having been freed of its responsibility for 'the homeland,' however, the Pentagon’s budget just keeps getting bigger. In 2024, it was at a thirteen-year high and remains—in inflation adjusted terms—above the levels of Reagan’s Cold War spending spree. Pentagon spending is up by 57 percent, inflation-adjusted, since 2001. There is no doubt, however, that heading the Department in Washington will be great for the career of Kristy Noem. She’ll get invited to cabinet meetings, go on national TV, and generally enjoy the pampered life of a high-ranking bureaucrat. Meanwhile, American taxpayers will pay more and more, in depreciating dollars, for yet another federal department.

The Absurdity Of War And Its Ethical Echoes In AI – OpEd	By Rafael Hernandez de Santiago In a city where artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize everything from grocery shopping to pet care, one question looms larger than the latest tech trend: What happens when we forget the lessons of humanity in the quest for efficiency? As our screens flash with notifications, a local philosopher and self-proclaimed ethical warrior, Mr. Raf, urges us to reflect on the often-ignored costs of conflict — both in the battlefield and in our evolving digital landscape. 'War, like a poorly programmed AI, often leads to catastrophic outcomes,' Raf quipped during a recent lecture. 'Blood is not even useful for making mud. It’s just messy!' In the annals of history, war has always demanded a staggering price, and not just in dollars and cents. The most chilling aspect is the loss of human life. Each casualty in conflict is not merely a statistic; it represents a unique individual — someone with hopes, dreams, and loved ones. 'When we wage war, we’re not just destroying buildings; we’re dismantling lives,' Raf stated, recalling the painful remnants of countless conflicts. According to the World Health Organization, wars claim tens of thousands of lives annually, and the toll is not limited to soldiers. Civilians — those who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time — find themselves swept into the storm. 'Imagine being at a family picnic and having it interrupted by artillery fire. That’s no way to spend a Saturday!' Raf remarked dryly, emphasizing the absurdity of violence amid humanity’s gatherings. But the scars of war run deeper than physical loss. The psychological impacts are profound and often overlooked. Soldiers return home carrying the invisible burdens of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. 'It’s like bringing a demonic AI home from work; you can’t just turn it off!' Raf lamented. He highlighted that the horrors of war haunt veterans and civilians alike, leaving a legacy of trauma that can echo through generations. The emotional toll on children, especially those growing up in war zones, is particularly alarming. 'You think kids have it rough with homework? Try growing up while bombs are falling!' Raf added, shaking his head in disbelief. The trauma these children endure can shape their futures, perpetuating cycles of violence and despair. Then there is the economic fallout, which can feel as invisible as the psychological scars but is no less devastating. The funds poured into military campaigns could be better spent on education, healthcare, and infrastructure. 'Let’s not forget the opportunity cost here,' Raf urged. 'Imagine the roads we could build or the schools we could fund instead of financing yet another conflict.' The irony is palpable: We invest billions in creating more sophisticated weapons while ignoring the very real problems we could solve with those resources. 'It’s like spending all your money on a fancy coffee machine but not using it to make coffee. What’s the point?' he quipped. Even our planet bears the scars of warfare. From bombings that raze forests to chemical weapons that poison water supplies, the environmental destruction wrought by conflict is catastrophic. 'War is like a poorly designed AI: It doesn’t just affect the immediate environment; it disrupts the whole ecosystem,' Raf argued. 'The trees don’t just fall; they take entire habitats with them. If we’re going to wage war, we’re also declaring war on the Earth itself.' The consequences of this destruction are felt long after the fighting stops. Communities left with barren land and polluted water face dire challenges. 'It’s a vicious cycle: War devastates, and the aftermath leaves people hungry and desperate,' he said. Raf’s mantra — 'Blood is not even useful for making mud' — serves as a stark reminder of the senselessness of war. 'It’s a truth that echoes through history: Conflicts often end in stalemates or resolutions that could have been achieved through dialogue,' he pointed out. The philosopher Aristotle once said: 'It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.' Yet, in war, we often accept the thought of violence without questioning its futility. 'Wouldn’t it be great if we could use all the energy we spend on fighting to solve our differences peacefully?' Raf proposed. 'Imagine an AI that mediates disputes instead of escalating them. Now that’s the kind of machine we need!' As Techville embraces the future of AI, Mr. Raf advocates for an ethical approach — one that learns from the past. 'If we can’t teach AI to value human life, we might as well hand over the keys to a malfunctioning robot,' he cautioned. 'We need to instill the values of diplomacy and cooperation in our technology.' In this context, the role of the international community becomes crucial. 'We must prioritize dialogue over military intervention,' Raf emphasized. By addressing root causes like poverty and inequality, we can create a world where conflicts are less likely to arise. 'Investing in education and social justice is like teaching AI to be kind — it’s not easy, but it’s necessary.' In a world increasingly defined by AI and technological advancement, it is our ethical responsibility to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of history. 'Peace isn’t just a noble idea; it’s essential for our survival,' Raf declared. As he concluded his talk, the crowd erupted in applause. 'Let’s strive for a future where our conflicts are resolved through dialogue, and where human life is cherished above all else,' he urged. 'After all, if we can’t learn from our past, how can we expect our machines to do better?' In Techville, where the buzz of technology mingles with the echoes of history, Mr. Raf stands as a beacon of hope. He reminds us that as we navigate the ethical landscape of AI, the lessons of humanity must guide our way. With a wink, he added: 'And maybe one day, we’ll look back and wonder why we ever thought war was a good idea in the first place!' • Rafael Hernandez de Santiago, viscount of Espes, is a Spanish national residing in Saudi Arabia and working at the Gulf Research Center.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CkFdwgyqTMbo	2024-11-14T15:50:40-08:00	
Czech FM: If Europe Wants US Protection Against Russia, It Must S...	By Aneta Zachová (EurActiv) -- The United States remains Europe’s greatest ally regardless of who is in the White House, said Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský, adding that to face Russia, the EU should back newly elected US President Donald Trump's China policy. 'We share common interests and values that endure,' Lipavský (independent) said at the opening of the Aspen Institute conference in Prague on Thursday (14 November). The head of Czech diplomacy also stressed that Europe should see a change in the US administration as an opportunity to take more responsibility for its own security. 'It is clear that the United States can no longer police the world alone. If we want to ensure prosperity and security in the transatlantic area, both sides must contribute,' he added. 'We must continue proving that we do not shy away from challenges and that we have courage and determination,' the Czech minister said, commenting that Trump respects those willing to stand up and fight. According to Lipavský, the US will increasingly focus on China and protecting the Taiwan Strait. 'Europe needs to focus on what is happening at its borders. If we expect a strong US commitment to our protection against Russian imperialism, we must be prepared to support them, which means also facing the challenge posed by China,' he explained. Lipavský noted that global instability is on the rise, with recent years bringing further shifts on the geopolitical stage. China’s influence and its ambitions to reshape the international order are growing, he added. 'The Kremlin seeks to disrupt transatlantic ties by aligning with Iran and North Korea. North Korean soldiers are already in Europe, and the axis of evil has thereby been fully revived,' said Lipavský.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9Cn95PP9A0Duc	2024-11-14T15:48:00-08:00	
Malaysia Protests New Philippine Maritime Laws For South China Se...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia said it is protesting two new Philippine maritime laws that it contends encroach on its boundaries in the South China Sea, amid heightened regional tension over Beijing’s increasing assertiveness about its expansive claims. In October, Malaysia lodged a similar complaint against Vietnam following a BenarNews article about Hanoi’s expansion on a South China Sea reef both countries claim, Reuters news agency reported last week. One security analyst said that despite regional tension, there is little risk of confrontation between Malaysia and the Philippines, or Vietnam, while a regional observer said that Manila and Hanoi were the transgressors in both cases. Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamad Alamin told his country’s parliament on Thursday that the new Philippine lawsencroach on Malaysia’s oil-rich state of Sabah, which borders the South China Sea. 'We’ve finalized and reviewed key issues in our protest note, which we’ll send today [Thursday] to affirm our commitment to protecting Sabah’s sovereignty and rights,' Alamin said, referring to the state on Borneo island that is claimed by both Malaysia and the Philippines. Manila on Nov. 8 enacted the Philippine Maritime Zones Act and Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act, which Alamin said extend into Malaysia’s boundaries mapped out in 1979, which Kuala Lumpur regards as internationally recognized. Manila had said the laws were intended to strengthen Manila’s maritime claims and restrict foreign ships and aircraft to designated lanes, to align with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Philippine officials did not immediately respond to Alamin’s comments to Malaysian lawmakers. Located off the southwestern region of the Philippines, Sabah has long been a thorny issue between the neighboring countries. In September 2020, the two countries took their dispute over who owns Sabah to the United Nations. The dispute remains unresolved. Separately, in June 2023, a Paris court upheld Malaysia’s challenge to a U.S. $15 billion arbitration award to purported heirs of an erstwhile sultanate called Sulu, part of which is in Sabah. An arbitration court in Paris had in February 2022 ordered Malaysia to pay that amount to settle a colonial-era land deal. The former Sultanate of Sulu was based in a small archipelago in the far southern Philippines. An analyst at the non-profit Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies said Malaysia has had to deal with the Philippines’ expansion efforts in the South China Sea. 'From the point of view of Malaysia, the Philippines is the troublemaker-in-chief,' Benjamin Blandin, a network coordinator at the council, told BenarNews. He said the Philippines destroyed Malaysian sovereignty markers in the Spratlys, a South China Sea island chain, in the 1970s and 1980s and later occupied Commodore Reef within the Malaysian exclusive economic zone. A country’s EEZs extends up to 200 nautical miles from its coastline. 'So based on this bilateral ‘history,’ Malaysia can only interpret negatively any further move of the Philippines, at least as long as the Sabah case is not solved,' Blandin said. Blandin said Vietnam had also destroyed markers at two maritime features in Malaysia’s EEZ before occupying them. Another analyst, Shahriman Lockman at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia, blamed Vietnam’s actions. 'Recent reports of Malaysia’s protest note to Vietnam, if accurate, reflect a growing impatience with Vietnam’s recalcitrance in the South China Sea and reluctance to engage in constructive discussions – behavior that deserves as much attention as China’s,' Lockman, a senior analyst at the institute, told BenarNews. 'Even so, I don’t anticipate any major escalation as long as Vietnam tries to restrain its fishermen who have a tendency to intrude into foreign EEZs, not only in Southeast Asia but across the Asia Pacific.' Lockman added that protests regarding territorial claims were normal. 'This is just a routine aspect of diplomatic relations – a typical day at the office for our diplomats,' he said. 'As countries build the legal foundations for their territorial and jurisdictional claims, it’s inevitable that overlaps are going to be reiterated.' 'Unless Manila actively pursues its legal claims, I don’t see a high risk of confrontation with Malaysia,' he said. Overlapping claims Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Brunei and Indonesia, as well as Taiwan, hold overlapping claims in the South China Sea and its islands and reefs. Beijing claims nearly all of the sea as its own based on historic rights, which were invalidated by a 2016 arbitration ruling by the international court in The Hague, Since the Philippines enacted its two new laws, Beijing and Manilahave launched protests against each other over contested South China Sea claims. Following Beijing’s protest, Marcos on Thursday said his government would maintain its stance on its South China Sea territories, the state-run Philippine News Agency reported. '[T]hey will continue to protect what they defined as their sovereign territory,' he told journalists. 'Of course, we do not agree with their definition of sovereign territory.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CrENeJA6YRdr	2024-11-14T15:45:30-08:00	
The Shifting Nature Of Journalism: Its Being Turned Upside Down –...	Over the last few years, journalism has undergone a massive change. The media organizations many journalists work(ed) for are also in the process of being turned upside-down. What can be described as the mass media in some form employed around 95 percent of journalists, where their prime function was to disseminate news, information, and objective analysis to the public at large. The mass media was portrayed as the 'Fourth Estate', a body that would act as a check and balance to government in a democratic system. Journalism is not always what it appears to be The uncovering of the Watergate break-in and the pursuant cover-up by the White House, which eventually brought down US president Richard Nixon, has been described as the epitome of investigative journalism. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein received much of their information from an insider whistleblower, known as ‘Deep Throat'. However, the revelation that ‘Deep Throat’ was Mark Felt, an assistant director of the FBI at that time, arises another possibility. The possibility that information provided by Felt to Woodward and Bernstein was intended by the ‘Deep State’ to end Nixon’s presidency. Felt was (perhaps unsuspectingly) an agent of the ‘Deep State’ on a mission to end a presidency. The lesson is there is truth, and there are motivations behind truths, where the public may never find out the reality of the situation. This example above, shows the power of journalism in finding the truth, or the flip side, where journalism is susceptible to being used by unidentified forces for the purposes of fulfilling hidden agendas. Journalism has been manipulated over the centuries, where the most well-intentioned journalists have either been misled, or themselves been dishonest. Journalism is often a pivot point between exercising the aspirations of the ‘Fourth Estate’, or acting for the Deep State. Much reporting has been influenced, either intentionally or unintentionally by state narratives. Weapons of mass destruction, Y2K, and Black Lives Matter (BLM) were partly media creations. Images of Obama, Biden, Trump, Assange, Putin, Zelenski, and others were carefully crafted by the legacy media, shifting public opinion either for or against them. This paradox of sorts has over the last 30 years created a loss of confidence and trust by the public in the legacy media. The public has grown wise. In the recent US presidential election, major legacy network audiences plummeted. Audiences moved across to the independent media, as faith has been lost in legacy journalism. Many journalists through pushing partisan narratives helped to destroy their employers. This will lead to fire-sales in the not too distant future. Comcast is already trying to sell MSNBC. Today’s journalistic landscape is vastly different to what it once was. Traditionally, graduates of journalism, economics, arts and other humanities would start their careers in journalism through what was once a very stable industry. Alternatively, cadet journalists would move into one of the satellite areas, such as local newspapers, regional radio, television stations, or specialist magazines. Over time, some would rise up to senior reporter and eventually editor in print media. Some would enter investigative journalism in crime, business or government. In television and radio, some would become a host or anchor of their own programs. Becoming the anchor of the news desk, or anchor of a long running high rating program was the pinnacle of the profession. Successful journalists would be given their own columns in print media, where they would focus on Op Eds, that in the past were very influential in shaping public opinion. In the past journalists tended to settle within legacy media corporations which represented their political beliefs, being left, centre, or right. Up until around 2010, being a journalist within the legacy media was considered a good career choice. One had a career path. Journalists would tend to move from one corporation within the legacy media to another, or an international media organization, which grew out of the CNN success in the 1980s. Very few would ever go out of the industry as an independent. The systemic control over narratives of the legacy media created a prism that has forced out some of the best journalists. The impending mass layoffs of journalistic staff at legacy media companies due to declining audience sizes will act as a great impetuous of independent journalism in the near future, which took a foothold during the Covid pandemic, and came of age during the recent US presidential election. The rest of the world is following this trend and set to play a major role in future elections. The new journalistic landscape This rise of the internet and ability of people to utilize platforms like YouTube from 2010 onwards as it became more sophisticated, provided a potential platform for citizen journalism. The so-called Arab Spring around the 2010s showed the potential of social media for groups to get information out to the public. Prior to this period, WHO rather than WHAT was the prime determinant of who was heard on the media and published. This prevented any balance of views getting public airing. Initially social media changed that. In addition, many academic journalists opened their own websites and published articles in websites such as this one, offering new perspectives to potential readers. These conditions precipitated the beginnings and rise of the early independent media. Podcasting is the new frontier in journalism. Podcasting was looked down up as glorified blogging, which was more opinionated than factual in most cases. A number of podcasts excelled during the recent US presidential election campaign and challenged the legacy media’s viewing audience numbers. Many prominent podcasters are now becoming household names within the independent media. The adversarial David Frost mode of interviewing is being replaced with a successful 'sit down coffee talk' style that has become a trademark of Joe Rogan. Many prominent journalists and broadcasters from the legacy media such as Tucker Carsen, Megyn Kelly, Russell Brand, and many others have moved across successfully to independent journalism. Some of the successes have their own staff of researchers, journalists and production crews. The very top echelon are financially much better off than when they were employed in the legacy media. Rumble, Spotify, and X (formally Twitter) are becoming premier platforms for podcasters. This area is growing exponentially. They have taken much of the audience the legacy media once had. Many print journalists have now moved across to Substack. The Substack platform allows articles with audio versions, podcasts, and video broadcasts. Substack is accompanied by Notes, which is a 'Twitter like' feed based community that is rapidly becoming a ‘go to’ place. Seymour Hersh, Michael Shellenberger, Matt Taibbi, and Bari Weiss, among thousands of other journalists have moved across to this reader supported platform. These sites have paywalls and collect subscriptions from readers. Some of the successful Substack sites are reported to earn USD 500,000 gross revenue per annum. Substack is still growing very fast. However, many new sites fail to deliver what they promise and become dormant, leaving subscribers in the lurch. Many other business model news portals have mushroomed across the world, relying on advertising from their websites. However, many fall by the wayside, unless they are financed externally by a benefactor. Many of these sites are also being blocked by government authorities, which is becoming a major hazard in the independent news industry. Independent media has shown itself much more capable of going after and exposing the 'Deep State' than the legacy media. Legacy media has been shown to have ‘relationships’ with agents of the Deep State, and influenced from the large revenue streams that Big Pharma provided. Those in this new media aren’t burdened by the editorial lines and narratives the legacy media has been caught up in. It appears to be only the conservative side of the independent media that is taking a critical look at president elect Trump’s new appointments. Pushback against independent media The tool of choice by the establishment to pushback against the independent media are the so-called factcheckers. Factcheckers are usually funded by left leaning political organizations, big pharma, governments through clandestine means, and even the intelligence agencies. The factcheckers with their adversarial approaches usually attempt to destroy narratives, rather than directly tackle facts. The flood arguments with superlative information. Quite often, the factcheckers themselves are often incorrect and misleading, and very difficult to communicate with and obtain a reply, if challenged. During the pandemic factcheckers often attacked recognized world experts. These organizations were based upon journalists, where medically qualified staff didn’t even exist within their organizations. The legitimacy of some of these factcheckers are mostly self-proclaimed. This highlights a group of journalists within the industry who could be best described as presstitutes. Presstitutes are ‘hired guns’ employed to put out particular narratives and stories into the public domain. The spread 'fake News’, or mis-information deliberately. This is very wide spread throughout the legacy media today. Pressititution has been allowed to flourish today because the legacy media is one of the few places those who want a career as a journalist can be employed. They have no choice but to be lucratively paid pressititutes. This is destroying the attractiveness of journalism today, which is losing favour as a tertiary education pursuit. Jobs in public relations, media promotion and advertising usually turn out to be much more lucrative, and provide better upward career mobility. A word about AI One of the biggest threats to the journalism industry is Artificial intelligence (AI). Content in online news portal is sometimes created through AI, making it unnecessary to employ content writers. Articles can be quickly produced through the technology, edited, and posted. However, AI is based upon ‘grounded knowledge’ already on the internet. Acetic and decorative descriptions created upon feelings of the moment are difficult to recreate in situational news or topic situations. As yet, AI will not be able to replace the spark and innovation of journalists as they work on ideas and hunches for creating content that will benefit the platform they are working for. All within the independent media have not forgotten what happened to Julian Assange, who exposed war atrocities committed by the US military, and the long suffering he endured. In 2023, 45 journalists were killed in the line of duty. Legal sanctions and lawfare are also being used to silence many within the independent media. Independent media is the last bastion of hopefully honest journalism that is capable of exposing the excesses of government and 'Deep States' in countries around the world. Independent media is now the legitimate 'Fourth Estate'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRY-1QJZwmBIV	2024-11-14T09:50:04-08:00	
Worldwide Trends In Diabetes Prevalence And Treatment From 1990 T...	There is the only disease that increases the risk of crippling complications such as amputation, vision loss, and kidney failure- Diabetes- It is also associated with cardiovascular disease, dementia, some cancers, and infections such as tuberculosis and severe COVID-19. Of the 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India with another 148 million in China, followed by the USA (42 million), Pakistan (36 million), Indonesia (25 million) and Brazil (22 million).' The Global study published in The Lancet reveals ahead of World Diabetes Day . An Additional concern is that 445 million adults aged 30 years and older with diabetes (59%) did not receive treatment in 2022, three and a half times the number in 1990 The study conclusions: (verbatim) The global rate of diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) in adults doubled from approximately 7% to about 14% between 1990 to 2022, with the largest increase in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Over the same period, rates of treatment for diabetes stagnated at low levels in many of the same LMICs where rates of the disease have drastically increased, resulting in almost 450 million adults aged 30 and over with diabetes globally (59%) who did not receive treatment in 2022. Meanwhile, people living in North America, Australasia, central and western Europe, and parts of Latin America and East Asia and the Pacific saw a significant improvement in treatment rates for diabetes from 1990 to 2022, contributing to widening global inequities in diabetes treatment. Authors say the study highlights the urgent need for financing of medicines and comprehensive diabetes programmes that enable early detection and effective treatment of diabetes in LMICs. Senior author Professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, highlighted the widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing. 'This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications – including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss - or in some cases, premature death.' He warned A unique study This global study with global data conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) analyzes the trends in both diabetes rates and treatment which includes all countries; The researchers used the data from over 140 million people aged 18 years or older from more than 1,000 studies in populations of different countries. The authors used statistical tools to bring all the data across different years, ages and countries together, and estimate diabetes rates and treatment in a way that enables comparisons across countries. Researchers defined Diabetes as having a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 7.0 mmol/L or higher, having a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 6.5% or higher (two commonly used diagnostic criteria options for diabetes according to modern guidelines) or taking medication for diabetes. They defined 'Treatment' as taking medication for diabetes. Global rates of diabetes doubled over the last three decades 'From 1990 to 2022, global diabetes rates doubled in both men (6.8% in 1990 to 14.3% in 2022) and women (6.9% to 13.9%). With the additional impact of population growth and ageing, this equates to an estimated 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, an increase of approximately 630 million people from 1990, when roughly 198 million adults were estimated to have the disease.' A press release from The Lancet noted 'The changes in diabetes rate from 1990 to 2022 varied drastically across different countries with mostly LMICs experiencing the largest increases (eg. the diabetes rate amongst women in Pakistan rose from 9.0% in 1990 to 30.9% in 2022, the largest increase across all countries). Whilst some higher-income countries, such as Japan, Canada and some countries in western Europe (eg. France, Spain and Denmark), saw no change or even a small decrease in diabetes rate over the last three decades.' The release added. Obesity and poor diets are important drivers of the rise in type 2 diabetes rates, and its variation across countries, Diabetes rate was either already high or increased more in some of the regions where obesity was or became prevalent between 1990 to 2022, compared to many high-income countries, especially those in the Pacific and western Europe , where, in general, obesity and diabetes rates did not rise or rose by a relatively small amount. According to Dr Ranjit Mohan Anjana, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, India, the disabling and potentially fatal consequences of diabetes, preventing diabetes through healthy diet and exercise is essential for better health throughout the world. 'Our findings highlight the need to see more ambitious policies, especially in lower-income regions of the world, that restrict unhealthy foods, make healthy foods affordable and improve opportunities to exercise through measures such as subsidies for healthy foods and free healthy school meals as well as promoting safe places for walking and exercising including free entrance to public parks and fitness centres,' she clarified. Widening global inequalities in diabetes treatment: The grim reality What is worrying is the grim reality that three out of five (59%) of adults aged 30 years and older with diabetes, a total of 445 million, were not receiving medication for diabetes in 2022, three and half times the number in 1990 (129 million). Since 1990, some countries, including many in central and western Europe, Latin America and East Asia and the Pacific, as well as Canada and South Korea have seen vast improvements in treatment rates for diabetes resulting in more than 55% of people with diabetes in these countries receiving treatment in 2022. The most notable information is from Belgium where the highest treatment rates were estimated at 86% for women and 77% for men. For many LMICs diabetes treatment coverage has stayed low and changed little over the previous three decades, with over 90% of people with diabetes not receiving treatment in some countries in both 1990 and 2022. Sadly, because of these trends, the yawning gap between the countries with the highest and lowest treatment coverage for diabetes has widened since 1990 to 2022; from 56 to 78 percentage points in women and from 43 to 71 percentage points in men. 'Our findings suggest there is an increasing share of people with diabetes, especially with untreated diabetes, living in low- and middle-income countries. In 2022, only 5-10% of adults with diabetes in some sub-Saharan Africa countries received treatment for diabetes, leaving a huge number at risk of the serious health complications.' said Professor Jean Claude Mbanya, University of Yaoundé 1, Cameroon. Status in India, China Pakistan, Indonesia and USA In 2022, almost one third (133 million, 30%) of the 445 million adults aged 30 years or older with untreated diabetes lived in India, more than 50% greater than the next largest number which was in China (78 million) because treatment coverage was higher in China (45% for women and 41% for men) than in India (28% for women and 29% for men). Similarly, Pakistan (24 million) and Indonesia (18 million), the next two countries with the largest number of untreated diabetes, surpassed the USA (13 million), which had higher treatment coverage (65% for women and 67% for men). The information provided in this unique study will be very useful for public health authorities, particularly in 'low and middle-income countries' (LMIC) in using their limited resources more effectively. Government must organize massive, well planned public education programmes, at all levels, with the support and cooperation of NGOs, religious groups and community leaders among others to arrest the Unbelievable Benefits of Eating Family Meals Together at Home Among the benefits of eating family meals together at home are Lower rates of obesity, overweight and eating disorders. Better nutrition and knowledge about a variety of healthy foods. Can we ignore the elephant in the room? Uncontrolled sugar intake Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in its latest guidelines advise limiting added sugar to 25 g per day or even eliminating it from the diet as it adds no nutritive value to the food other than calories. The normal intake is higher. For children aged 2 to 19 years, the dietary guidelines for Americans for 2020-2025 prescribe 12 teaspoons (50g) of added sugar from both food and beverages. For kids and young adults (2–19 years old), the average daily consumption of added sugars was already 17 teaspoons in 2017–2018. Excess sugar intake at this age can have a profound adverse impact. As a first step, parents should read the labels on packed foodstuffs to estimate the amount of sugar their children consume daily. Family dinners taken together at home will help in reducing excess sugar intake. Family Dinnner Projects (FDP’s) constant advocacy of what is good will inspire the participants. They will not ignore this elephant (excess sugar intake) in the room	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRY-a1IJ0ETa2	2024-11-14T09:48:23-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Victory: A New Global Reality – Analysis	With a calm, exhausted tone and in words that, for the first time, lacked the harsh bitterness marking his speeches of the past four years, Donald Trump (R) addressed a small audience in Florida on the night of 5–6 November 2024. Announcing his victory in the U.S. election, he declared, 'We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing. Look what happened—is this crazy?' It appears he has indeed accomplished something remarkable. According to the final electoral vote results, Trump secured 312 votes, while Kamala Harris (D) received 226. From a former president pursued by numerous legal cases that could land him in prison, who survived two assassination attempts, and who faced a strong and highly organised Democratic opponent wielding considerable power and with a larger campaign budget, along with various polls predicting he would place second in the race, Trump emerged as the victor. Donald Trump defied television networks, newspapers, and polling institutions that forecasted a close presidential race, clinching a decisive victory for his second term as President of the United States. On 5 November, he ascended to the world’s most powerful position, becoming the next President of the United States. Trump’s victory was both decisive and impressive, with a lead of more than four million votes over his opponent, Kamala Harris. He won more than 74 million votes, compared to 70 million for his Democratic rival. The significance of Trump’s presidential victory was further amplified by the Republican Party’s success over the Democrats in the Senate, with a 53/46 margin, and in the House of Representatives, with a count of 212 to 200. This means that Republicans now have complete control over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, allowing them to implement their policies, particularly domestically. These include providing tax cuts to stimulate the economy, imposing high tariffs on imports—especially from China—and continuing construction of the wall on the southern border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration. The economy and immigration were the main pillars of the Republican presidential and congressional campaign, with much of Trump’s rhetoric centred on connecting the two, as the economy was seen as the primary factor behind his Democratic opponent’s failure in leadership, driving voters towards the Republicans. At 78, Trump has become the oldest candidate ever elected to the presidency, breaking the record previously held by Joseph Biden. Now the 47th U.S. president, Trump returns to office four years after serving as the 45th president, becoming only the second president in American history, after Grover Cleveland, to serve two non-consecutive terms[2] . While the Republican campaign centred heavily on domestic policy, offering extensive details and information, many unknowns remain regarding foreign policy issues. This topic was always addressed only in passing or with rhetorical statements, such as Trump’s frequent claim that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours and his recent pledge to Arab-American voters in Michigan, promising 'peace over there in the Middle East' but without clarifying how this would be achieved. Despite the scarcity of information and plans, some aspects of Trump’s foreign policy can be anticipated based on his previous term as president from 2016 to 2020. Why did Kamala Harris lose the U.S. election? The defeat of the sitting U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris by Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election is sure to be remembered and discussed for years to come. The topic is expected to generate numerous books, as well as a wealth of academic and expert discussions, with media analysts in particular examining data from various pre-election polls. Although Harris began her campaign on a strong note, she struggled to connect with voters through her speeches, much like Hillary Clinton (D) in 2016. She spent most of her time attempting to convince voters that Trump was unfit for office but struggled to clearly explain why she herself was the better choice. Jason Miller, Trump’s campaign manager and communications strategist, highlighted what he described as a turning point in the election race. This shift came after several weeks in which polls favoured Harris. Miller noted that Harris’s campaign truly started to unravel after her awkward response to a straightforward question from Sunny Hostin, host of 'The View,' on 8 October: 'Would you have done anything differently than Biden over the past four years?' Clearly flustered, Harris replied, 'Nothing comes to mind,' which sent her advisers into a panic and prompted a wave of online ridicule from Trump supporters. Harris faced an almost insurmountable challenge in trying to counter the steep decline in approval ratings and growing dissatisfaction with Biden, as roughly two-thirds of voters believed the country was heading in the wrong direction. Throughout 2024, Biden and prominent members of his party were convinced he merited a second term due to his impressive political career. Following the 2022 U.S. Midterm elections, in which the Democrats performed far better than expected—largely credited to an anti-Trump sentiment—Biden seemed overly self-assured. When journalists asked him the day after the election what he might do differently to address voter concerns about the economy and the prevailing sense that the country was on the wrong track, he simply replied, 'Nothing.' After Biden’s prolonged delay in withdrawing his candidacy, Harris was thrust from behind the scenes into the spotlight, with only three months to promote herself. By contrast, Trump had spent eight years shaping his public image, including his four years in office, followed by four years of relentless self-promotion. Amid rising inflation and two major wars—in Europe and the Middle East—many voters looked back nostalgically to the pre-pandemic period, which, under Trump, had experienced relative economic stability and growth. Following his decisive victory for the Republican Party’s nomination, even those who had previously opposed him resigned themselves to the reality and embraced his narrative. Meanwhile, the public and Trump’s supporters had become accustomed to a steady stream of negative news about him, blunting the impact of many of the allegations made against him. For many, it was of little consequence that he faced 91 criminal charges, with 34 convictions and a ruling holding him liable in a sexual assault case. Instead, his derogatory labels for Harris—like 'low IQ,', 'crazy Kamala,' and 'Comrade Kamala'—struck a chord and captured the attention of a large segment of voters. The political landscape in 2024 was primed for Trump’s return. Voter sentiment had shifted in ways that Harris’s campaign team didn’t fully grasp—for instance, cultural issues now held far greater importance than they had for decades, possibly even overshadowing economic concerns in their impact. In other words, the progressive issues that had permeated the Democratic Party, referred to as the 'woke era'[3], proved disastrous to Harris’s campaign, particularly as Trump and the Republicans managed to frame them as a far-left agenda, disconnected from the concerns of the average voter. As Harris lost support among certain social groups traditionally loyal to the Democrats, such as Arabs, Muslims, and young Black Americans, Trump played on exaggerated fears of migrants and focused on what he viewed as the average American’s main concern — the economy, in line with the catchphrase from President Bill Clinton’s era, 'It’s the economy, stupid!'[4]. High inflation rates (9.59% in 2022, 4.06% in 2023, and 3.1% in 2024)[5] eroded the real value of income for the vast majority of citizens, especially those in rural areas outside major urban centres. Trump’s approach was rooted in isolationism, flat tariffs and fiscal adjustments, promising to revive the economy through protectionist policies reminiscent of 19th-century practices. These policies would undermine the foundations of capitalism, which has long been a driving force of the United States. He also vowed to dismantle the structure of the current American system according to the conservative 'Project 2025' agenda. This message resonated with tens of millions of voters who have seen the 'American Dream' of prosperity collapse, while extreme wealth accumulates in the hands of the ruling class, the expert class, and elites who control the government for their own benefit. What will foreign policy look like in the Trump-2 era? Trump’s triumphant return appears to be reigniting a period of uncertainty, not only within a deeply divided American society but also on the global stage. During his first term (2016–2020), his actions were hard to anticipate due to his distinct personal style, unconventional proposals, and unusual relationships with leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and other authoritarian figures worldwide. Today, despite having had four years of experience with him in power and another four watching him prepare for a comeback, uncertainty around his foreign policy prevails. There’s little doubt that many outside the United States—from Beijing and Moscow to Brussels (EU), Tehran, and Tel Aviv—are attempting to anticipate the shape of the new administration’s policies and the extent to which it might seek to change the rules of engagement between the United States and the rest of the world. What is clear is that Trump does not trust the current state administration managing U.S. interests and will appoint a cadre of loyal supporters to influential positions, individuals who will act on his whims without regard for the consequences. When American voters chose Trump for president in 2016, U.S. allies responded with various 'hedging strategies'[6] for self-protection. This time, however, it seems they are in a far weaker position than they were a decade ago. Allies are likely to try to curry favour with him, offering concessions as a means of survival much as they did during his first term. Trump is expected to continue and expand his strategy of leveraging pressure on U.S. allies through diplomacy—a strategy that, at best, will yield superficial cooperation while leaving structural issues unaddressed. EU braces for potential new U.S. tariffs and duties The European Union (EU) faces the possibility that Trump will impose a set of additional taxes and tariffs on European exports to the U.S., a campaign promise that could threaten the already fragile European economy, strained by recession and inflation. Rather than issuing threats of counter-tariffs, the EU is now attempting to appease Trump by proposing certain trade agreements that might dissuade him from introducing the anticipated duties. It is unclear how China might respond to such a policy, as Trump may opt for a combination of tariffs and military posturing rather than direct conflict, given the interdependence of the Chinese and American economies. On the other hand, Trump has publicly criticised President Joseph Biden’s administration’s policy on Ukraine, pledging to push for an end to the war there immediately following his election—even before taking office on 20 January of the coming year. The president has expressed doubts about the necessity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has provided security for America’s allies since the end of World War II, preferring instead that they pay for the costs of American protection. Policy toward China and Iran The return of former U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House could signal tougher enforcement of American oil sanctions against Iran, potentially reducing global supply and introducing geopolitical risks by challenging China, Iran’s largest oil importer. Tough sanctions on Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), could drive up global oil prices. However, this situation might be mitigated by other Trump measures, such as promoting domestic oil production, imposing tariffs on China to curb its economic activities, or softening relations with Russia, potentially allowing for increased Russian crude oil shipments. A return to Trump’s 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran might cut Iranian crude oil exports by one million barrels a day. This could be implemented relatively quickly and without additional legislation, merely through the enforcement of existing sanctions. A tougher stance on Iran also translates to indirect but strict measures aimed at China, which does not recognise U.S. sanctions and remains the largest importer of Iranian oil. Trump has threatened to act on his campaign promises by imposing sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to shield American industry, with rates as high as 60%. In response, China might deepen its engagement with the BRICS bloc, which aims to become an Eastern alternative to the Western G7. China may also begin reducing its reliance on the dollar in oil and other commodity transactions. Trump is aware that such an aggressive sanctions policy poses a serious risk to the dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency. On 5 September 2024, at the Economic Club of New York, Trump discussed the potential risks that sanctions pose to the dominance of the U.S. dollar. He stated, 'So I use sanctions very powerfully against countries that deserve it, and then I take them off. Because look, you’re losing Iran, you’re losing Russia.' He further elaborated, 'I was a user of sanctions, but I put them on and take them off as quickly as possible because, ultimately, it kills your dollar and it kills everything the dollar represents.'[7] China and Iran have created a trading system that relies mostly on the Chinese yuan and a network of intermediaries to bypass the dollar and American regulators, complicating the enforcement of sanctions. Trump may also ease sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, which Western nations imposed in response to Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. He is expected to gradually lift all sanctions on Russia’s oil industry. Policy on the Middle East During his election campaign, Trump took a calmer and more pragmatic tone when discussing the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and the broader Middle East situation, in contrast to the Democratic camp, whose positions on various issues appeared vague or confusing, especially regarding the Palestinian question, pro-Iranian militias in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, as well as relations with Afghanistan. Judging by his first term in office, it is expected that President Trump will likely prioritise the Middle East once again. In his first term, Trump made history by choosing Saudi Arabia as his first foreign visit and recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. On the Palestinian issue, he sought to mediate the 'deal of the century'[8] between Israelis and Palestinians and reinforced Israel’s regional ties with some Arab nations, such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, where diplomatic relations were established. Is Trump planning to unseat Netanyahu? Regarding his stance toward the current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, prominent Israeli economist and political advisor Eran Yashiv believes that Trump will aim to remove Netanyahu from power at the first opportunity, despite their prior friendship. According to Yashiv, Trump is likely to work toward Netanyahu’s ouster sooner or later. According to this Israeli researcher, Trump’s stance is driven by two economic motives. First, he feels that Netanyahu’s policies come at a high price. Israel received roughly $18 billion in U.S. military aid last year, and Trump has expressed his reluctance to spend American funds either on Ukraine or Israel, stating that continued financial commitments in the Middle East are not on the agenda. The second reason is his desire for Israel to reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia under the 2020 Abraham Accords[9], with Saudi Arabia’s prerequisite for such a deal being the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu and his right-wing allies oppose this, which would prompt the Saudis to demand Netanyahu’s removal. Some analysts describe Netanyahu’s relationship with Trump as complicated. Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat in New York and writer, believes that Netanyahu is somewhat wary of Trump, 'He thinks he can manipulate him, but is afraid that if Trump realises this, he could get very angry—unlike Biden, who, for some reason, never pressured him or resisted his manipulations.' There is no doubt that the Middle East will be a focal point for the new U.S. administration. The rest of the world awaits in apprehension, anticipation, and patience Donald Trump’s electoral victory heralds a wave of sudden shifts in U.S. foreign policy. The newly elected president is expected to bring back the defining features of his first term: a trade war with China, deep scepticism—bordering on hostility—toward multilateralism, an affinity for powerful leaders, a style that defies diplomatic norms and standards, and an inclination for improvisational posts on his Truth Social platform. Trump’s advisors say, 'His ‘peace through strength’ approach is exactly what the country needs in this critical moment.' Trump has been given a mandate by the American people to change the course of U.S. foreign policy, and there is little doubt that this time he feels more assured in pursuing his bold and sometimes volatile ambitions. With his unique vision and unconventional style, Trump may well achieve a great deal. However, if he succeeds in restoring the United States to 'greatness,' true to his slogan 'Make America Great Again,' this greatness will inevitably come at a high cost to international relations. Until he officially takes the keys to the White House early next year, the rest of the world can only wait in apprehension, anticipation, and patience.

Maldives’ Suggests New Financial And Trade Instruments To Help SI...	At COP29, President Mohamed Muizzu spoke as a representative of a country most threatened by climate change At the COP29 summit held in Baku, Azerbaijan on November 13, a grim picture of the effects of climate change emerged. As the delegates shared their thoughts, scientists said that despite all the talk about mitigating climate change, another bump upward had occurred in greenhouse gas emissions. Euro News said that in 2024, the world is on track to put 37.4 billion metric tonnes of the main heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. It's a 0.8% increase from 2023. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant and prevalent 'greenhouse gas' emitted by human activity. While carbon dioxide is essential for keeping the Earth's surface temperature above freezing, more of it intensifies the 'greenhouse effect' which is a rise in global temperatures. Once emitted, carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years, with 40% remaining after 100 years. Methane is another powerful but shorter-lasting greenhouse gas. Methane is the main component of natural gas. In the first two decades after it's released, methane is more than 80 times more effective at warming the climate system than carbon dioxide. In 2023, both carbon dioxide and methane levels in the atmosphere reached record highs. The global concentration of carbon dioxide rose to an average of 419 parts per million in the atmosphere and Methane rose to an average of 1922 parts per billion. UN reports say the globe must cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to be in with a chance of limiting warming to the internationally agreed-upon threshold of 1.5 Celsius or the limit agreed to at the 2015 climate talks in Paris. Marginal Gains This year's pollution increase isn't quite as large as last year's 1.4% jump, scientists said while presenting the data at the UN climate talks in Azerbaijan (COP29). There is still no sign that the world has reached a peak in fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The world still has six years before passing 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Earth is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius, according a United Nations study. Therefore, countries are clearly not doing enough on a global scale to reduce emissions, said Mike O'Sullivan, a University of Exeter climate scientist. 'We need to massively increase ambition and actually just think outside the box of how we can change things, not be so tied to fossil fuel interests,' he urged. Biggest Carbon Emitters According to the Global Carbon Project team, the four biggest carbon emitters are China, the United States, India and Europe. China is the world's biggest annual carbon polluting nation with 32% of the emissions. India accounts for 7%. India's carbon pollution jumped by 4.6% in 2024. The US was responsible for 13% globe's carbon dioxide in 2024. Europe accounted for 7% of the world's carbon pollution However, China's emission could drop to zero in the next two months and is 'basically flat,' O'Sullivan said. Carbon emissions dropped in both the United States and the European Union. They fell 0.6% in the US mostly from reduced coal, oil and cement use. . Europe saw its carbon dioxide output drop 3.8% from last year - driven by a big cut in coal emissions. Urgency in Maldives One of the most threatened by climate change is Maldives. It is also the world's lowest lying country. The highest natural point is just 2.4 meters above sea level. Today, one of the main problems for Maldivians is water. And it is likely to get worse with climate change. While the Northern islands face drinking water shortages during the dry season, from April to May, most Southern islands face a different problem: flooding. The UNDP is supporting Maldives, to ensure that most vulnerable islands have year-round access to potable water and that they can cope with floods on their own. Nearly half of its population lives in Male, the capital, which is less than 1.4 sq,km. The rest is spread over 186 small, scattered islands. There are no rivers or streams on any of the islands. Except for Malé and a handful of other islands, most islands rely on rain for drinking water. Islands affected by floods and shortages of potable water receive relief from the capital island Malé. Transportation costs are high with the Maldives scattered geography. This makes emergency relief very expensive for a government already struggling economically. The danger is that climate change is expected to bring stronger storms, and longer periods without rainfall. A rise in the ocean's temperature and acidification has had devastating effects on coral reefs, affecting tourism and fisheries, both critical to the livelihoods of most Maldivians. Damaged reefs also function less effectively as a first line of defence against sea swells and flooding. Until the 1990s, Maldivians used groundwater for drinking. But over the past decade, the groundwater of most islands got contaminated. The freshwater lenses of most islands was badly affected by the Tsunami of 2004 and poorly planned urbanization. As a result, today, rainwater, together with water produced using desalination and expensive bottled water are the only potable water options. In the past ten years, the National Disasters Management Center in Malé had to send emergency shipments of water to about half of the 186 inhabited islands during the dry season. An expensive solution that sometimes can take up to two weeks to arrive. Most households have one tank of 2500L and fill it by collecting rain from their roofs. Bigger families might even have 2 or 3 tanks, since one is not enough for them to make it through the dry season. Biosphere Reserve UNESCO has designated certain areas as biosphere reserves. This designation sets up a 'learning place for sustainable development,' a site for testing approaches on how to sustainably manage natural systems that conserve biodiversity and manage and mitigate climate change impacts on local economies. In 2011, UNESCO designated Baa Atoll, in central-western Maldives, as a biosphere reserve. Comprising 75 islands inhabited by 12,000 people dependent on tourism and fisheries, it supports one of the largest groups of coral reefs in the Indian Ocean, which act as a conduit for the transport of 'plankton' necessary for biodiversity to thrive and to reduce the effect of waves and storm surges. Plankton are tiny organisms that float in water and are carried by tides and currents. Plankton are important for the health of the ocean and play a big role in the marine food chain. Since this designation as biosphere, Baa Atoll's sustainable ecotourism tourism industry has bloomed, hosting more than 350,000 tourists annually pre-COVID. USAID helped assess ecologically sensitive areas and the recovery potential of coral reef ecosystems. To improve climate resilience, USAID supported government efforts to develop a management plan for one of the largest and biologically diverse marine-protected areas in Maldives. Maldives' Suggestions at COP29 At the Leaders' Summit of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) on Climate Change, held at Baku in Azerbaijan on November 13, the Maldivian President Dr. Mohamed Muizzu emphasized that the current financial system does not provide SIDS with the necessary resources to address climate impacts, rendering their ambitious climate goals difficult to achieve. He outlined three major issues for action to reshape the global financial architecture to better support SIDS. Addressing climate change requires a coordinated support from various key players—including the UN, multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, and the private sector. The Maldivian President said that traditional lending and debt models need rethinking. He proposed the concept of linking 'debt forgiveness to the achievement of specific climate resilience milestones.' For example, a SIDS might see a portion of its debt forgiven if it reaches certain adaptation or emissions-reduction targets. This approach could provide immediate financial relief and an incentive for SIDS to pursue climate goals, especially since high debt levels often prevent these nations from making necessary investments in resilience, Dr. Muizzu said. He also called for a redefinition of creditworthiness, where a nation's climate resilience efforts factor positively into its ability to secure funding, rather than relying solely on traditional economic indicators. Dr. Muizzu urged COP29 to establish a new, more realistic climate finance goal that reflects the actual needs of SIDS. Current climate finance mechanisms often fall short in addressing the scale of funding required by SIDS to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, he pointed out. He sought discussions on establishing a 'comprehensive international carbon market mechanism', a platform that could allow countries to trade emissions reductions or offsets. 'Such a system, if well designed, could generate additional financial resources for SIDS and provide a new revenue stream for climate adaptation and mitigation efforts,' Dr. Muizzu said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRYtT_UQUxJ59	2024-11-14T09:44:44-08:00	
Shaping Outcomes: How Perspective Drives Decision-Making In Negot...	In negotiation and diplomacy, perspective is a defining factor that shapes how decisions are made, options are evaluated, and outcomes are reached. Perspective—the unique lens through which individuals and nations view their interests, intentions, and interactions—plays a crucial role in influencing the positions diplomats take, the strategies they adopt, and the compromises they are willing to make. In an interconnected world where power dynamics and cultural diversity are key elements, understanding perspective is essential for navigating complex diplomatic landscapes and reaching durable agreements. This article explores how perspective shapes decision-making in negotiation and diplomacy, affecting everything from goal-setting to conflict resolution. The Nature of Perspective in Diplomacy and Negotiation 1. Defining Perspective in Diplomacy Perspective in diplomacy refers to the subjective outlook that countries and their representatives hold toward international issues, shaped by national interests, historical experiences, cultural values, and geopolitical priorities. Each nation approaches diplomacy with its own 'worldview,' influencing not only what it aims to achieve but also how it interprets the motivations and actions of other countries. Perspective determines what each party values and fears, often revealing as much about a country's underlying priorities as about the immediate stakes of a negotiation. 2. Perspective as a Framework for Decision-Making Perspective offers a cognitive framework for understanding the negotiation process. It allows diplomats and negotiators to classify issues as more or less important, identify allies or adversaries, and distinguish between acceptable compromises and unacceptable risks. This framework serves as a guide, steering decision-making in ways that reflect a nation's overarching goals and limiting the possibilities for alternative interpretations or concessions. Influence of Perspective on Goal-Setting and Strategic Priorities 1. National Interests and Diplomatic Goals The priorities of a nation are largely influenced by perspective, which defines what it considers to be its national interests. For example, a realist perspective, which views power and security as paramount, might lead a country to prioritize military alliances and security commitments in negotiations. In contrast, a liberal perspective, which values cooperation and interdependence, might encourage a nation to seek multilateral agreements and partnerships that promote collective welfare. These differing perspectives shape the diplomatic goals that nations set for themselves, ultimately guiding the overall direction of negotiations. 2. Shaping Strategic Priorities Perspective affects how countries rank issues, determining which elements of a negotiation are viewed as 'core interests' and which are secondary. During trade negotiations, for instance, a country whose perspective emphasizes economic independence may resist agreements that reduce tariffs on certain sectors, while a nation with a more globalist perspective may prioritize access to foreign markets over domestic protections. In setting these priorities, nations often reinforce their perspective on a larger scale, emphasizing their long-term interests and establishing their values as a key component of their negotiation stance. The Role of Perspective in Defining Negotiation Tactics 1. Formulating Negotiation Positions Perspective influences the stances that diplomats take in negotiations, determining how strongly they push for certain terms and where they might be willing to compromise. A nation that views itself as a regional power, for instance, may adopt a more assertive negotiation style, seeking terms that affirm its influence. Conversely, a country with a perspective that emphasizes diplomatic cooperation may be more inclined to adopt conciliatory tactics. Perspective-driven negotiation positions can either facilitate agreement or create impasses, depending on how compatible they are with the perspectives of other parties. 2. Determining Bargaining Behavior Perspective also influences bargaining behavior, including how diplomats communicate their positions, the concessions they are willing to make, and the red lines they refuse to cross. For instance, nations with a zero-sum perspective on resources may employ hardline tactics, viewing any concession as a potential loss. In contrast, countries that prioritize long-term diplomatic relations might adopt a 'win-win' approach, using collaborative tactics and emphasizing mutual benefits. The chosen bargaining behavior, shaped by perspective, impacts not only the tone of negotiations but also the likelihood of reaching a consensus. Perspective as a Tool for Conflict Resolution 1. Understanding Opponents' Perspectives Conflict resolution in diplomacy often depends on the ability to understand the perspective of opposing parties. By recognizing the values, motivations, and fears that drive the other side, diplomats can craft solutions that address these concerns, even if they do not fully align with their own perspective. This empathetic approach can reduce misunderstandings, ease tensions, and lead to compromises that satisfy all parties' core interests. For example, in peace negotiations, understanding each faction's perspective on sovereignty, autonomy, or security can facilitate agreements that recognize these interests without violating fundamental values. 2. Reframing Issues to Align Perspectives In some cases, conflict resolution requires reframing issues so that they align more closely with each party's perspective. During the Paris Climate Agreement negotiations, for instance, developed and developing nations held different perspectives on responsibility and burden-sharing. By framing the agreement as a global effort where all parties contributed according to their capacity, negotiators were able to accommodate these varying perspectives and reach a landmark accord. Such reframing helps bridge divides, creating common ground even when initial perspectives are divergent. Challenges of Perspective in International Negotiations 1. Perspective as a Barrier to Consensus While perspective is crucial for understanding, it can also become a barrier when parties hold rigid, incompatible views. For example, in nuclear non-proliferation negotiations, countries like the United States and North Korea often adopt opposing perspectives on security and sovereignty. These clashing perspectives make consensus challenging, as each side interprets the other's actions through a distrustful lens, leading to a stalemate. Overcoming such barriers requires a willingness to shift perspectives, which is difficult in high-stakes issues with deep-rooted distrust. 2. Risk of Misinterpretation Perspectives can lead to misunderstandings when parties misinterpret each other's intentions or actions. Cultural perspectives, in particular, shape how communication styles, gestures, and negotiation tactics are perceived. For instance, in East Asian diplomacy, indirect communication is often valued, while Western negotiators may interpret such behavior as evasive or noncommittal. Misinterpretations rooted in perspective differences can derail negotiations, prompting parties to adopt positions based on assumptions rather than facts. 3. Balancing National and Global Perspectives Global challenges like climate change and pandemics demand a shared perspective, yet national perspectives can lead to conflicting priorities. In the case of global climate agreements, countries have struggled to balance their perspective on economic development with the need for environmental sustainability. Nations like India and China, whose perspectives prioritize economic growth to alleviate poverty, often find it challenging to commit to the same emissions targets as developed nations. Balancing these perspectives to reach a common goal remains one of the greatest challenges in multilateral diplomacy. Perspective and the Evolution of Diplomatic Strategies 1. Adaptive Diplomacy and Shifting Perspectives In a world where international issues are increasingly complex, adaptive diplomacy—shifting perspectives based on changing circumstances—has become essential. Nations that adapt their perspectives, such as those that integrate economic growth with environmental responsibility, are better positioned to address evolving global issues. By broadening their perspective, countries can engage in more flexible negotiations, allowing them to work with diverse partners and tackle multifaceted problems effectively. 2. Perspective as a Means of Building Trust Trust-building often depends on the ability to demonstrate an understanding and respect for other parties' perspectives. In negotiations involving historical tensions, showing empathy for an adversary's viewpoint can build rapport and lay the groundwork for future cooperation. For example, U.S. negotiations with former adversaries like Vietnam have evolved from contentious to cooperative, in part due to a shift in perspective that acknowledges past grievances and focuses on common interests. By aligning perspectives, diplomats can strengthen relationships and facilitate sustainable partnerships. 3. Developing a Global Perspective for Sustainable Outcomes As global challenges demand greater cooperation, developing a 'global perspective' that transcends national boundaries is increasingly vital. This perspective emphasizes collective responsibility, long-term vision, and the interconnectedness of nations. In negotiations on climate policy, pandemic preparedness, and human rights, a global perspective encourages countries to consider how their actions affect the international community. Adopting such a perspective allows for solutions that benefit all parties and reinforce the stability of the global system. Conclusion Perspective is more than a mere lens in negotiation and diplomacy—it is an active, influential force that drives decision-making, defines priorities, and shapes diplomatic outcomes. Nations approach international negotiations with perspectives rooted in their cultural, historical, and strategic values, guiding their goals and tactics. However, the dominance of particular perspectives can create barriers and conflicts that complicate consensus. As diplomacy becomes increasingly complex in a multipolar world, adaptive and empathetic approaches to perspective are essential for reaching enduring solutions. Developing a more global perspective that values shared interests and cooperation will be key to addressing the pressing challenges of our interconnected world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdNrfgDu0Uzz	2024-11-14T09:42:59-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Attends Exercise Resolute Warrior In Latvi...	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Latvia on Thursday (14 November 2024) to observe Exercise Resolute Warrior 24, and to meet with President Edgars Rinkēvičs and Prime Minister ​Evika Silina. Involving more than 3,500 Allied troops, Resolute Warrior 24 marks the first major field war-fighting exercise for the NATO Multinational Brigade in Latvia. The Canadian-led brigade includes personnel from twelve other Allies and is part of NATO’s strengthened defence posture on the eastern flank. During his visit to Ādaži Military Base, the Secretary General said that exercises such as Resolute Warrior, 'give our forces experience of working together.' He added that such intense training, 'will make us more prepared to deter any aggression, and demonstrate our ability to defend all Allies.' During a press conference alongside President Rinkēvičs, Mr Rutte highlighted that Latvia spends more than 3% of its GDP on defence and supports Ukraine 'with military equipment, ammunition and training'. He called for more Allied support for Ukraine, including air and missile defence, to protect critical infrastructure during the winter season. Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroups and exercises like Resolute Warrior serve as critical elements of NATO’s reinforced deterrence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRZ7XZWGWhlJv	2024-11-14T09:40:31-08:00	
The Role Of Psychology And Psychoanalysis In Diplomacy And Negoti...	In diplomacy and negotiation, where power dynamics, cultural sensitivities, and high-stakes decision-making converge, psychological insights can be transformative. Diplomats and negotiators engage in complex interactions that require not only a strategic understanding of objectives but also a deep comprehension of human emotions, motivations, and cognitive patterns. Over recent decades, the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis have contributed substantially to diplomacy, shedding light on how psychological factors such as empathy, unconscious biases, defense mechanisms, and emotional regulation can influence negotiation outcomes. These insights enable diplomats to navigate more effectively through conflicts, bridge divides, and foster cooperation. This feature article explores how psychology and psychoanalysis enhance diplomacy and negotiation. It covers various dimensions, from understanding cognitive biases to managing emotions, building trust, and employing psychoanalytic tools to interpret deeper motivations. By integrating these approaches, diplomats and negotiators can achieve more constructive and enduring results in their engagements. 1. The Intersection of Psychology and Diplomacy Historically, diplomacy has often been analyzed from a political or strategic perspective, focusing on national interests, alliances, and power balances. Yet, human factors are at the heart of all diplomatic efforts. Diplomacy involves communication, persuasion, and compromise—tasks inherently influenced by psychological factors. Psychology offers insights into how individual personalities, emotional reactions, and social dynamics shape diplomatic interactions. Psychoanalysis, with its focus on unconscious motivations and defense mechanisms, goes a step further by exploring the hidden aspects of human behavior that impact decision-making. Understanding unconscious influences, such as projection, denial, or displacement, can provide diplomats with a more profound understanding of how unresolved personal or historical traumas might be affecting negotiations. By recognizing and managing these factors, diplomats can better anticipate potential roadblocks and tailor their strategies to foster cooperation. 2. Cognitive Biases and Their Impact on Diplomacy Cognitive biases—systematic patterns of deviation from rationality—play a crucial role in diplomacy and negotiation, often leading to misunderstandings or suboptimal decisions. Psychologists have identified various biases that can affect diplomats, including the following. Confirmation Bias Diplomats, like all people, may interpret information in ways that confirm their existing beliefs. This bias can lead negotiators to ignore important data that contradicts their assumptions. In high-stakes negotiations, confirmation bias may prevent diplomats from fully considering alternative viewpoints, thereby hampering compromise and conflict resolution. Attribution Bias Attribution bias can distort how diplomats interpret each other's actions. For example, they may attribute their adversary's behavior to inherent aggressiveness while viewing their own behavior as purely defensive. This mutual misperception can escalate tensions, making it difficult for diplomats to empathize with the other side and increasing the risk of conflict. Anchoring Bias Anchoring occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter. In diplomacy, anchoring can influence how initial offers or positions are perceived and lead to a narrow focus on early assumptions. Awareness of anchoring bias enables diplomats to remain open to alternative solutions rather than becoming rigidly fixed on initial terms.Understanding these biases helps diplomats recognize when they might be falling into psychological traps, allowing for more rational, open-minded, and flexible negotiations. This self-awareness can reduce misunderstandings and contribute to more balanced and fair agreements. 3. Empathy as a Diplomatic Tool Empathy—the ability to understand and share the feelings of others—is a cornerstone of effective diplomacy. By empathizing with counterparts, diplomats can better understand their motivations, fears, and priorities, which is essential for finding common ground. Building Trust and Rapport Empathy enables diplomats to build trust, which is often the foundation for successful negotiations. Trust is not only about transparency but also about genuinely acknowledging and addressing the concerns of the other party. Empathetic listening can validate the feelings of all parties involved, making them feel understood and reducing defensive reactions. Defusing Hostility Empathy can help de-escalate tension in contentious negotiations. When diplomats take the time to see an issue from their counterpart's perspective, they are more likely to frame their arguments in a way that reduces hostility. For example, instead of focusing on accusations, they may focus on shared concerns or mutual benefits. Humanizing Opponents In conflicts, opponents are often dehumanized or reduced to stereotypes, which can fuel aggression and inhibit peace efforts. Empathy allows diplomats to humanize their counterparts, understanding them as complex individuals with legitimate concerns. This can be particularly useful in post-conflict settings, where long-standing animosities may persist despite formal agreements.Incorporating empathy into diplomatic practices doesn't mean compromising one's position; instead, it enhances the ability to communicate persuasively and negotiate with greater awareness of psychological dynamics. 4. Emotional Regulation in High-Stakes Negotiations Negotiations can be emotionally intense, particularly when issues of national pride, security, or historical grievances are at stake. The ability to regulate one's emotions is critical for diplomats, who must maintain composure and think clearly, even in stressful situations. Psychological techniques can help diplomats manage their emotional responses, enabling them to stay focused and objective. Mindfulness and Stress Management Mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing, visualization, or progressive relaxation, can help diplomats stay calm under pressure. These techniques allow diplomats to maintain a clear mind and prevent emotional reactions from overshadowing rational thinking. In recent years, some foreign ministries have incorporated mindfulness training to help diplomats cope with the emotional demands of their roles. Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence (EI)—the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions and empathize with others—is a valuable skill in diplomacy. High EI allows diplomats to recognize and interpret emotional cues, which can help them adjust their strategies accordingly. For example, a diplomat with high EI might detect signs of frustration or impatience in their counterpart and adjust the pace of the negotiation to prevent escalation. Recognizing and Addressing Emotional Triggers Through psychological training, diplomats can identify their emotional triggers and learn to respond in measured ways. For instance, a diplomat who becomes easily frustrated by perceived disrespect might learn to reframe such interactions, focusing on the overall goal of the negotiation rather than reacting impulsively. Emotionally regulated diplomats are more effective in managing the challenges of negotiation, as they can keep their focus on long-term goals rather than short-term frustrations. 5. Psychoanalytic Approaches to Unconscious Motivations in Diplomacy Psychoanalysis brings a unique perspective to diplomacy by exploring the unconscious motivations and defense mechanisms that influence individual and collective behaviors. This approach can be particularly insightful when dealing with historical grievances, intergenerational traumas, or deeply rooted ideological conflicts. Projection and Scapegoating In some diplomatic conflicts, projection—a defense mechanism in which one attributes one's unwanted feelings or traits onto others—can lead to scapegoating. For example, a state may project its own internal problems onto an external enemy, escalating hostility and justifying aggressive policies. Psychoanalytic techniques can help diplomats recognize when projection is at play, making it possible to address underlying issues more constructively. Understanding Historical Traumas Nations, like individuals, can carry psychological scars from past traumas, such as colonialism, occupation, or genocide. These traumas can influence current diplomatic behavior, leading to hyper-sensitivity or hostility in certain contexts. By understanding how historical trauma shapes national identity and foreign policy, diplomats can avoid triggering emotional reactions and approach negotiations with greater sensitivity. Transference and Countertransference Transference occurs when individuals project feelings associated with past relationships onto current interactions. In diplomacy, this might manifest as a diplomat viewing a counterpart as an 'enemy' based on past conflicts, even if the situation has changed. Conversely, countertransference refers to the diplomat's own emotional reactions to the counterpart, which may influence their negotiation style. Recognizing these dynamics allows diplomats to separate past grievances from present realities, creating a more neutral space for dialogue. Psychoanalysis encourages diplomats to consider not only the visible aspects of negotiations but also the unseen psychological factors that shape diplomatic interactions. This deeper awareness can prevent misunderstandings and foster genuine resolutions. 6. Utilizing Psychological Insights in Cross-Cultural Diplomacy Diplomacy often involves navigating cultural differences that influence communication styles, attitudes toward authority, and concepts of honor. Psychological insights into cultural psychology and cross-cultural communication can enhance diplomats' effectiveness in diverse settings. Cultural Sensitivity and Adaptive Communication Psychology offers tools for understanding cultural dimensions, such as individualism vs. collectivism or high vs. low power distance, which affect diplomatic interactions. In some cultures, indirect communication and subtlety are valued, while others prioritize directness and clarity. A diplomat aware of these differences can tailor their communication to avoid unintentional offense and build rapport. Avoiding Stereotyping Cultural psychology helps diplomats avoid stereotypes, which can hinder meaningful interaction. Rather than assuming that all members of a culture behave in certain ways, culturally informed diplomats can appreciate the diversity within cultures and avoid making assumptions that may harm negotiations. Intercultural Empathy Understanding cultural values and social norms enables diplomats to empathize with foreign counterparts' perspectives, reducing misunderstandings and fostering cooperation. For example, a diplomat who understands the importance of 'saving face' in certain cultures may take extra care to avoid language or actions that could cause embarrassment, thus maintaining mutual respect and facilitating smoother negotiations. Cross-cultural psychology provides diplomats with the tools to approach international interactions with sensitivity, allowing them to bridge cultural divides and enhance diplomatic outcomes. The Future of Psychology and Psychoanalysis in Diplomacy As global challenges become increasingly complex and interconnected, psychology and psychoanalysis will likely play an even greater role in diplomacy and negotiation. By integrating these fields into diplomatic training and practice, diplomats can become more adept at understanding the human aspects of international relations. The next phase of psychology in diplomacy may involve even greater use of psychoanalytical and psychological techniques, such as scenario analysis, role-playing exercises, and emotional intelligence assessments. These methods can help diplomats refine their skills in managing emotions, interpreting unconscious motives, and fostering empathy. Additionally, advances in neuropsychology may provide new insights into how stress, fatigue, and decision fatigue impact diplomacy, leading to improved strategies for maintaining resilience in high-stakes negotiations. In an era marked by rapid technological change, cultural shifts, and unprecedented global challenges, psychology and psychoanalysis offer diplomats invaluable tools for achieving nuanced, sustainable, and empathetic solutions to complex issues. By embracing these perspectives, diplomats and negotiators can create more stable and harmonious international relationships, built on a foundation of deep human understanding.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRTI4q_bDTIiB	2024-11-14T09:38:26-08:00	
Remarks Of IMF Managing Director To 25th Jacques Polak Annual Res...	Good morning! Welcome to the 25th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference! Twenty-five years is a huge milestone. And I want to give my heartfelt congratulations and thanks to the Research Department and Pierre-Olivier for all you’ve achieved over the past quarter century. Over that time, we’ve had our ups and downs. Periods of high growth and low growth. Profound changes in the global economy, and crises. Through it all, the ARC has shed light on some of the most difficult questions facing our profession, helping policymakers navigate the most complex challenges. My task is to honor this incredibly distinguished history—in under 5 minutes. Impossible, but I will try! The first ARC was under Michael Mussa. It was the year 2000, when Maury Obstfeld laid out a new international macroeconomics research agenda looking beyond the Mundell-Fleming Model—at the Mundell-Fleming lecture, no less! That was 15 years before Maury became Chief Economist. After Michael came Ken Rogoff, whose accomplishments we celebrated here last year. Then, under Raghu Rajan's leadership, the ARC focused on fundamental issues that remain highly relevant today: from exchange rate regimes to capital flows and structural reforms. These insights were crucial in guiding policymakers' responses to mitigate the impact of the Global Financial Crisis. The next ARC explored the latest factors impacting exchange rates and examined their policy implications. It was led by Simon Johnson—who we're proud to say is now a Nobel laureate! Afterwards, Olivier Blanchard’s record-setting run of seven ARCs began, at the height of the Global Financial Crisis. And, in the years that followed, it was only natural that many of these ARCs allowed us to reflect on macroeconomic and financial policies in the shadow of the crisis. That work made us better prepared for the shocks of the past five years. Gita’s ARCs were shaped by the pandemic. They helped us better incorporate epidemiology into macroeconomic models early in the COVID crisis, and later gave insight into pandemic’s impact on capital flows. And with Pierre-Olivier’s stewardship, we have written a new playbook to help countries address the challenges of the post-pandemic, climate-impacted world, including inflation and elevated debt. This year will continue the ARC’s tradition of excellence, I am sure, as you Rethink the Policy Toolkit in a Turbulent Global Economy. The profound shocks of COVID and war have left us with inflation and fragmentation, even as we need economic growth to address challenges from poverty to climate change. Yet the growth outlook, while stabilizing, remains much lower than pre-pandemic. Inflation has declined, but not been fully defeated. And elevated debt levels constrain fiscal space, especially in countries that most need to spend to educate their young populations, build infrastructure, and increase their climate resilience. This conference will focus on how to address these and other challenges that central banks and fiscal authorities face—and what the international community can do together. With Gita, Pierre-Olivier, and the RES team in the lead, you are in great hands. I wish you the best for an illuminating, productive conference. Over to you, Gita.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRSfMM2zWgO-P	2024-11-14T09:36:57-08:00	
Prophet Abraham Started Three Unique Monotheistic Religions – OpE...	For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send hundreds of his prophets to this small tribe and worked continually for centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Allah selected Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) and the descendants of Prophets Ishmael, Issac, and Jacob to be the first, but not the last monotheistic community. 'There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him.' [Qur'an 60:4] and 'Indeed Ibrahim was a nation obedient to Allah, a Hanif, he was not one of the polytheists.' [Qur'an 16:120]. God makes Prophet Abraham several promises that will be fulfilled if he heeds the comments he has been given: Genesis 12:2 states 'I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and it shall be a blessing. 12:3 I will bless those who bless you and curse him that curses you; and all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you.' Most of these promises have already been fulfilled. Prophet Abraham was the first person to be called a 'Hebrew' in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 14:13). The term Hebrew probably comes from the verb to go over a boundary, like the Euphrates or Jordan river, or to be a migrant. Ten generations later the Philistines in Canaan used the term 'Hebrews' to refer to the 12 tribes of Israel: 'The Philistine commanders asked, 'What about these Hebrews?' (1 Samuel 29:3); and Prophet Jonah identified himself to non-Jewish sailors as 'a Hebrew' (Jonah 1:9). According to a new Pew Research Center study released on August 19 2024: 'Christians are about 30% of the world's population, the world's migrants are 47% Christian, according to the latest data collected in 2020. Muslims make up 29% of the migrant population and 25% of the world's population. Jews, who are only 0.2% of the world's population and 1% of migrants, are by far the most likely religious group to have migrated, with 20% of Jews worldwide living outside their country of birth compared to just 6% of Christians and 4% of Muslims. Prophet Abraham was the first Muslim Hebrew as Qur'an 3:67 states: 'He (Abraham) was not Yahuudiyyan, 'a Jew', nor Nasraaniyyan, 'a Christian', but rather a Haniifan', 'a monotheistic Hebrew believer submitting (Islam) to the one imageless God who created all space and time; and who made Prophet Abraham's descendants through Prophets Isaac and Jacob (Israel), into a great multitude of monotheists called the People of Israel-Banu Israel. The Prophet Isaiah said: 'Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the Lord: look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug. Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he [Abraham] was only one when I called him, that I might bless him and multiply him. (Isaiah 51:1-2) and the Qur'an states: 'You have an excellent example to follow in Abraham.' (60:4) and 'Follow the way of Abraham as people of pure faith.' (3:95) And the Quran 2:130 states: And (everyone) who shuns the creed of Abraham (is) but a foolish soul. We chose him (Abraham the Hebrew Genesis 14:13) in the world and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous. 2:131 And when his Lord said unto him 'Submit!' (aslim) he said, 'I submit (aslamtu) to the Lord of the worlds.' Most people in the world have learned of Prophet Abraham, not by reading a book of Jewish history or religion, but by listening to and reading from the Christian Bible or the Muslim Qur'an. This unique and amazing situation is a reflection of a promise made to Prophet Abraham more than 36 centuries ago, and recorded in both the Torah and the Qur'an. 'I swear (says God) because you did this - not withholding your son, your favorite one, I will bestow My blessing on you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore; and your descendants shall seize the gates of their foes. All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your descendants, because you have obeyed My command.' (Genesis 22:16-18) and 'Indeed, We chose him (Abraham) as one pure and most distinguished in the world, and he is surely among the righteous in the Hereafter'. (Qur'an 2:130) Prophet Isaiah also said: But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, are the offspring of Abraham, my friend;' (Isaiah 41:8) So the biological offspring of Prophet Abraham (the Banu Israel) became the first ongoing monotheistic community when God rescued them from Egyptian oppression; and made an ongoing covenant with them at Mount Sinai. Prophet Abraham was not born a Jew, but his descendants from his grandson Jacob/Israel became the Banu Israel—Jewish People. For 1200+ years after Prophet Moses, the Banu Israel was the only ongoing monotheistic community in the world. 'Similarly, no Messenger came to the People before them, but they said (of him) 'A sorcerer, or one possessed''! (51:52) And as the Qur'an informed us: 'The people of Noah denied before them, and the companions of the well and Thamūd; and ʿAad and Pharaoh and the brothers [neighbors] of Lot; and the companions of the forest, and the people of Tubbaʿ. All denied the messengers [Allah sent to them] so My threat was justly fulfilled.' [50:12-14] And those monotheistic communities that did last for a few generations, always fell away during subsequent centuries; while most, but not all, of Banu Israel remained loyal to the covenant God made with them at Mount Sinai: 'Before (Messengers Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus) We sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they call Allah in humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not call Allah in humility? On the contrary, their hearts become hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them. (Qur'an 6:42-43) But as the centuries passed the ongoing need to protect the Jewish way of life became increasingly the focus of their efforts; and after the deaths of Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, Banu Israel became more and more inclined to building a fence around the Torah, and making the rules more numerous and restrictive. In 1065 Pope Alexander called for a Crusade against the Moors in Spain. Then in 1073, Pope Gregory issued official proclamations urging Christian princes to recover lands occupied by Muslims in Spain, over which he claimed papal sovereignty on the basis of previous Christian rule and right. These decrees were really the beginning of the Christian Crusades against Islam. For example, in 1209, Pope Innocent III urged a band of northern French nobles to rally an army that swept into southern France, where they unleashed a crusade so bloody it included the sacking of Beziers by an army under papal authority. Just before the attack, which would kill 15-20,000 men, women and children, the pope's man on the scene, Arnaud Amalric, is reported to have uttered one of history's most famous orders: 'Kill them all. God will know his own.' The next 4-5 centuries of religious military war in Europe and the MiddleEast was the result of the previous 2-3 centuries of all-out polemic verbal war between Christianity and Islam. Religious truth became a zero sum game: anything positive said about another religion was seen as a weakening of your own side. The goal was not to modestly try to harmonize various religious perspectives of the one and only God; but to self-righteously exaggerate religious differences, well beyond any reasonable understanding of the two sides. In the Greek world, the Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) was well known, while the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca was not known by name at all. The first Roman reference to the Baitullah is from Diodorus Siculus, a first century BCE Roman historian who wrote that in Arabia there was a temple greatly revered by the Arabs. According to G. E. Von Grunebaum, who I studied with at the University of California Los Angeles in 1959, Mecca was also mentioned by Ptolemy, a second century Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who wrote, 'The name he gives it allows us to identify it as a South Arabian foundation created around a sanctuary.' (G. E. Von Grunebaum, Classical Islam: A History 600–1258, p. 19) Yet just seven centuries later both of these cities and sanctuaries, one almost unknown by the Romans and the other totally destroyed by the Romans, were destined, throughout the Middle Ages in both Europe and west Asia, to be viewed as the heart, lungs or navel of the world. Jerusalem and Mecca were frequently portrayed by Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the center of their maps. God willing, someday everyone may see both cities and their sanctuaries as central to our monotheistic connections to the One God of Prophets Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. If we can live up to the ideal that religious pluralism is the will of God, we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5) So God's promise to Prophet Abraham, that the other families of humankind will ultimately bless themselves, and one another, thus aspiring to be like Abraham's descendants (Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14), and will have fulfilled the three Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. As a Hadith states: 'Abu Dharr narrated that one day he asked the Messenger of Allah (Prophet Muhammad): How many prophets are there in all? He replied: 124.000. Abu Dharr then asked: How many of them were messengers (bring a sacred scripture) prophets? He replied: 313 from the above group. He asked: Who was the first of them (the oral only prophets)? He replied: Adam...The first prophet among Bani Israel was Musa and the last of them (the Jewish prophets) was Isa (Jesus), and they (the Jewish prophets) were in all 600.' (Biharul Anwar, Vol. 11, Pg. 32.) This is why the 600 Jewish prophets who were the descendants of Prophet Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) were and still are to this very day the smallest and oldest base of an unbroken, ongoing, monotheistic nation of survivors. Prophet Abraham, like his early descendant prophets until Messenger Moses, the covenant with the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, and the Torah; was a muslim and not a member of the Jewish, Christian or Islamic religious community at that time; because there was no Jewish, Christian or Islamic religious community then. 'Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists.' (Qur'an 3:67) Thus the Qur'an instructs members of the Islamic community when others say to them: 'Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided...' Muslims should reply: 'Rather, [we follow] the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth [imageless monotheism], and he was not of the polytheists.' (2:135)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRfQnvdSqZX8l	2024-11-14T09:34:53-08:00	
Inconvenient Question: Science Is Gifting Us New HIV Prevention T...	Any new HIV prevention method is not meant to sit on the shelf but to be used by the people who need it to protect themselves from HIV. We have to ensure that new HIV prevention technologies that are coming out of the scientific research pipelines, are accessible to people everywhere - especially those who are more at risk of HIV acquisition. Jim Pickett has passionately called for translating scientific gains into public health outcomes - not with delay, but with equity and justice. Currently Jim Pickett serves as a Senior Advisor for AVAC and directs their Choice Agenda programme focussed on HIV prevention research and its implementation. Inconvenient truth When asked what has changed between 2018 and now, he said: 'COVID-19 reshaped our entire world. Traumatizing as it was, it also changed some things for the better, I think, globally. We got better at finding new ways to deliver healthcare. We also learned that we could develop a vaccine quickly and that was a win. But we failed to deliver it equitably in many parts of the world.' Jim was speaking with CNS at the 5th HIV Research for Prevention Conference of the International AIDS Society (IAS) in Lima, Peru. Sadly, equity and justice are not driving our health responses. 'We have had some exciting scientific developments in the HIV prevention space. We have cabotegravir- a once-in-two months injection that can prevent HIV. But accessibility is a different issue. It is available in our country, but it is extremely expensive. It is also complex to deliver. So the number of users is very low. It is available, but not accessible for many,' he said. 'We now have another long-acting injectable lenacapavir- two shots a year- that is on its way to being approved. And people are calling it game-changing and transformative in terms of HIV prevention. But it remains to be seen what access will look like. Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Brazil are among the countries that have been left out (from the 120 countries list) by Gilead (makers of lenacapavir) to provide it at reduced costs, despite these 4 countries being part of the clinical study of the drug,' he added. Imagine the injustice: people of countries which participated in the clinical study of lenacapavir for a greater common good, will not be able to get the best of benefits when it comes to its rollout, as of now. 'I am also excited about the tenofovir-medicated rectal douche as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for men who have sex with men- a douche that provides hygiene before anal sex, and then leaves the drug behind that provides protection against HIV. In an early Phase-1 study examining its safety and acceptability, majority of the participants stated that they would prefer the douche over daily oral PrEP,' said Jim. 'If PrEP douche passes through phase-2 and phase-3 studies, and then move to regulatory approvals and get into the market, it would be our first-ever behaviourally congruent intervention, which means harnessing a behaviour that people already do,' he said. PrEP is a medication for HIV negative people to protect them from getting infected with HIV. A choice should be accessible Science finds new tools to create new HIV prevention options for people, but then to have success in terms of making it accessible to all so that we can reduce new HIV infection rate, continues to remain a struggle. 'It is like science gets you to the top of one Mount Everest and then we find that there is a second Mount Everest of 'access' to climb. And that might even be a taller version of the first Mount Everest,' rightly said Jim. 'While I am really excited for these new choices that we will have, I am also frustrated that they will not be real choices, unless people can truly access them. There is no change in the game if you cannot get on the field, and there is no 'transforming' anything if that drug looks really good on paper, and then it sits on a shelf, and the people, who really need it, do not have access to it. It needs to be cheap, affordable, and accessible to everyone anywhere in the world. We definitely need to have some strategy for this,' he added. We cannot put profit above people's health 'The focus of pharmaceutical companies is on their shareholders and on making money. But public health is not about profit; it is not about money; it is about rights-based access - for everyone, regardless of their means. So there is a conflict of interest in that relationship. We need people at the negotiating table who want to fix this. So, community involvement from the very beginning is very important. It is about having all hands on deck, I think everyone who is involved- from every community person, organisations, governments, policy makers, funders, pharmaceutical companies, we have to hold them accountable,' rightly said Jim. Take the example of Lencapavir. 'It does not need to be priced over US$ 40,000 per person per year to be profitable. We are not asking pharmaceutical companies to do this for free, but do they deserve rewards that are exponentially beyond profit and just so high that it can bankrupt health systems? Or make health systems say that it is beyond their financial capacity to pay that kind of money? We cannot bankrupt our health system for one innovation when we have multiple health needs for the community. We cannot subsidise products that are so grossly expensive. We do not know how much the price of lencapavir will be decreased through voluntary licensing by the generic manufacturers who are also for-profit companies. So there is a lot to do to make sure that when it moves forward and it gets produced, it is priced in a way that is affordable for the people,' he said. PrEP approved in 2012 but many high burden nations yet to roll it out in public programmes There are countries like India where even the oral daily PrEP is not in the government programme even 12 years after it was approved in 2012, forget about the long-acting new PrEP products. It is ironical that HIV treatment is free in India, but HIV prevention options like PrEP are not. 'So, in a way you are putting people at risk of getting infected with the virus and then offer them lifelong treatment, but not giving them prevention medication for free. What sort of economy is this? If you have HIV, you get those very drugs (that could have been given to prevent HIV infection in the 1st place),' he said. Even in richer nations like USA problems and disparities plague the development response. 'There are many HIV programmes for people living with HIV around housing, food security and transportation vouchers. And I am happy for that. I am a person living with HIV, and I am happy to see other programmes that help people who need support. But then there are many people who are HIV negative, and who still are struggling- they do not have good housing, do not have a decent job, and are struggling to find their next meal. If we can get someone safely housed, make sure they have a full meal, it would help a lot in HIV prevention too all on its own,' rightly remarks Jim Pickett. 'People who have HIV prevention as their concern have many other concerns as well, and many times those other concerns are more pressing problems for them- like where am I going to sleep tonight? Am I going to get a meal today? When will I get a job? How am I going to continue my education? These are their priorities, which make them more vulnerable to HIV infection,' he added. Reducing vulnerability of people to HIV requires society-wide structural interventions and political commitment backed with resources. 'We are one whole person, and not separated in compartments,' says Jim. He is right. All health and development enshrined in promises our governments have made are also contributing towards HIV prevention, support and care. We, the people need to connect the dots and call for integrated development responses that are socially just.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRUGye4ZrM_du	2024-11-14T09:33:05-08:00	
Bangladesh’s Pivot: A New Path In Regional Diplomacy – OpEd	In a remarkable departure from the recent past, Bangladesh is charting a new course in its foreign policy, distancing itself from India's sphere of influence and seeking to strengthen ties with Pakistan while reinvigorating regional cooperation within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). This shift, while strategic in its diplomatic ambitions, is also driven by deep domestic dissatisfaction with the previous government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid, whose long tenure came to an abrupt end amid growing allegations of human rights violations and corruption. For over a decade, under Sheikh Hasina’s leadership, Bangladesh's foreign policy was largely aligned with India, shaped by shared historical ties, economic cooperation, and geopolitical concerns. But the years of close ties with New Delhi have come under scrutiny. Many in Bangladesh now view this alignment as compromising the country's sovereignty, and public discontent has reached a tipping point. Accusations of widespread human rights abuses and political repression under Hasina’s rule have fueled a rethinking of the nation’s diplomatic and internal policies. The interim government, which replaced Hasina's administration, has moved decisively to shift the country’s diplomatic focus. In the wake of mounting allegations, including accusations of genocide and political persecution, the interim government’s actions signal a deliberate attempt to break free from India’s embrace. Notably, the decision to freeze the financial accounts of Hasina’s family — long a symbol of political power and influence — underscores the growing public anger over perceived corruption and authoritarianism. The country’s pivot is further evidenced by its bold moves within the defense sector. A key moment in this recalibration occurred on October 6, 2024, when Chief Advisor Yunus inaugurated the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters. The event marked a significant step in fortifying the autonomy of Bangladesh's military, which had, in the past, been seen as closely aligned with India’s security concerns. This newfound emphasis on national pride, paired with the rollback of laws protecting the Mujib family, signals an effort to reclaim political independence and lessen the influence of external powers. Another critical step in this pivot came when the interim government invited the UN Commission for Human Rights to investigate allegations of human rights abuses during Hasina's tenure. This move — widely seen as an attempt to expose abuses tolerated under the previous administration — has further strained relations with India, which had historically lent tacit support to Hasina's government. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in this diplomatic realignment has been the rupture in Bangladesh’s relations with India. At the 79th United Nations General Assembly, Bangladesh’s request for a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Yunus was met with Indian reluctance, further highlighting the growing discontent with Indian influence in Bangladesh's domestic affairs. India’s behind-the-scenes efforts to bolster the Awami League — the political party led by Hasina — were seen by many in Bangladesh as an attempt to meddle in its internal politics, exacerbating the rift between the two nations. In response, Bangladesh recalled its envoy from New Delhi, signaling a clear intent to distance itself from India’s regional dominance. As Bangladesh seeks to recalibrate its foreign relations, it has begun to turn its attention toward Pakistan, a country with which it shares a complex history. A recent diplomatic meeting between Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary and the Pakistani High Commissioner marked the beginning of what could be a thaw in bilateral relations. The two countries, which have long been estranged due to the lingering wounds of the 1971 independence war, are now looking to strengthen trade ties, as evidenced by Bangladesh’s decision to remove the 100% physical inspection requirement for Pakistani goods. This move is seen as a step toward re-establishing a cooperative economic relationship. More importantly, Bangladesh has expressed strong support for reviving SAARC, the regional organization that has long been sidelined due to political tensions, particularly between India and Pakistan. In collaboration with Nepal, Bangladesh is promoting a regional agenda focused on economic integration and collaborative growth, presenting SAARC as a platform for cooperation unencumbered by the bilateral issues that have historically divided the region. Bangladesh’s efforts to encourage educational exchanges with Pakistan further reflect a growing desire for people-to-people connections, signaling a shift toward fostering regional unity rather than perpetuating divisions. This pivot is not just a reaction to domestic unrest or external pressures; it also reflects broader regional dynamics. India’s assertive foreign policy in South Asia, particularly its growing influence in Bangladesh, is facing increasing pushback from its neighbors. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan are keen to carve out independent spaces in the region, free from the shadow of any single dominant power. By revitalizing SAARC, Bangladesh and its regional partners may have an opportunity to build a cooperative framework that prioritizes mutual economic development over narrow geopolitical rivalries. For Bangladesh, the road ahead is one of balancing regional cooperation with the assertion of national sovereignty. Whether the country can successfully navigate this complex diplomatic landscape remains to be seen. But the clear shift away from India, combined with efforts to reintegrate Pakistan into the fold of regional cooperation, represents a pivotal moment in Bangladesh’s foreign policy — one that will shape its future trajectory and its place within South Asia’s evolving geopolitical order. The hope is that, in the coming years, Bangladesh can emerge as a more independent actor in South Asia, advocating for a vision of regional cooperation that transcends the dominance of any single power. Whether it will succeed in this endeavor depends on its ability to balance the aspirations of its people with the demands of its regional partners. For now, Bangladesh’s pivot toward Pakistan and SAARC is a powerful statement that its future lies in the hands of its own people — not in the spheres of influence of its larger neighbors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdrjSC3Zu_vb	2024-11-14T09:31:14-08:00	
The US Presidency: A Challenging Role And Trump’s Management Stra...	The U.S. presidency is a demanding and exhausting role. To succeed, it requires a skilled and experienced team. However, the new cabinet members and senior management chosen so far by Donald Trump have raised some questions regarding their qualifications. Particularly, the choices for Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State are considered controversial in terms of their experience. Additionally, no announcements have yet been made for critical positions like Treasury and Energy. Trump's selections appear to favor loyalty and discretion, often choosing individuals unlikely to overshadow him and willing to carry out directives without hesitation. This dynamic is expected to require the U.S. deep state and bureaucratic structures to closely monitor and potentially restrain Trump's decisions. While Trump's policies are widely debated, some see potential positives. His plans include deporting undocumented immigrants, reducing government expenditures, and ending conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. He also aims to cut defense spending and address unemployment and inflation by raising tariffs to boost domestic production. Throughout this process, Trump's blunt rhetoric, criticisms of opposition journalists, and participation in summits like G7 and G20 will likely attract attention. Though he is expected to keep dialogue channels open with Turkey, a positive approach is not anticipated. At 78, Trump's health may provide a slight advantage in handling the physical toll of office. Despite his age, he avoids smoking and drinking, stays active by playing golf, and leads a relatively healthy lifestyle. By the end of his term, he may not appear as worn out as Joe Biden did. Whether Turkey will choose to mirror certain Trump policies remains to be seen. It is uncertain if a similar cabinet structure might emerge in Turkey, but this will likely become clearer in the coming period.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRbmi2KhiYMmk	2024-11-14T09:29:26-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Turkey Page (Part III) – OpEd	The economic history of Africa is as old as the first people of mankind. The economy of the continent moved from hunter gathering to agriculture (farming and livestock rearing), fishing, manufacturing, trade, and international trade. Major trading states grew up in many parts of the continent but the most known were those of the Sahel belt, the East and Southern Africa regions, the first across the Sahara desert to north Africa and further to Europe and the others to Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. But the regions of the central and equatorial Africa had their own economic activities which were mostly involved in agriculture and hunter-gathering. The Northeast Africa region of the continent gave rise to the ancient Egyptian and Nubian civilizations which preceded the Greek city states and the Mediterranean island states of Minoa, Crete, and Rhodes. They traded with the East Africa States starting from present day Horn of Africa States all the way to Mozambique and southern Africa. The trading nations on the east of the continent from Egypt to southern Africa traded in animal products (Rhino horns, ivory, hides and skins), gold, iron ore, agricultural produce and implements such as endemic cereals. Most of these states became eventually part of the immense Muslim world and were connected to Arabia, Persia, and Asia, all the way to China. The monsoon winds which blow towards India and Asia during the months of April to October and towards Africa during the months of November to March played pivotal roles in the trade with Asia. The natural growth of the economy of the continent was disrupted by the European colonialism of the eighteenth to mid-twentieth century and its, sometimes, sub-human treatment of the populations of the continent. There was not much of an African economy for some two hundred years other than those connected with Europe and treated as part of the European economy. Some countries were doing well during this period while others dipped deeply into oblivion. Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa were prominent economies during this period, as were the economies of East Africa. The Sahel belt dipped, and the large empires and states of that region were slowly dismantled. Today they appear to be shadows of their great past. No wonder there are coups and counter coups in that region. The article is not designed to address African economic history but the above was a brief introduction to the story of the African economies to enable us to address the Türkiye-Africa growing relationship, which mostly revolves around the economies of the two parties. This itself is a subject which can pose its own controversies such as the incomparability of a continent with a population of some 1.5 billion and an area of some 30.3 million sq. km., surrounded by two oceans and two seas to a single country of some 90 million people and an area of 784,000 sq, km. But one must address the subject though, since there is a growing relationship between Africa and Türkiye, as the recent regular meetings between the two parties indicate. These are mostly related to economic partnering between the two parties over the past two decades through summits and forums and even visiting by one party or the other, to regions of the other. The first Türkiye-Africa Summit was organized in Istanbul in 2008 and was attended by 50 African states. The Summit ended with two documents, namely the 'Istanbul Declaration on the Africa-Turkey Partnership' and the 'Cooperation Framework for the Africa-Turkey Partnership,' which laid down the basis of the cooperation between Türkiye and Africa. Three years later, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with all his family members became the first foreign leader to visit Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, which was then undergoing one of its worst moments of its over two-thousand-year-old history. It faced then, a severe food shortage through one of the recurrent droughts of the region and volatile armed groups. It was a gesture most Somalis were grateful for and would never forget. The Türkiye economic partnering with Africa and the growing diplomatic relations between the two parties was further complimented by security assistance from Türkiye to some of the countries of continent. These security issues include among others the construction of its first military base in the continent in Mogadishu, Somalia in 2017 to train and support Somali security forces who are constantly battling imported foreign terrorism in the country. Türkiye also supplied its advanced military technologies to Ethiopia (the drones) to fight off the difficult Tigray region and other rebellions. It also works with the Libyan government in Tripoli to support it through military training, intelligence and other activities in the defense realm. It is, indeed, a large supplier of arms to the continent. The third Türkiye-Africa Summit was held again in Istanbul in December 2021, where it was declared that the two parties would cooperate in the areas of a) Peace, Security and Governance, b) Trade, Investment and Industry, c) Education, STI skills, Youth and Women Development, d) Infrastructure Development and Agriculture, and e) Promoting Resilient Health Systems. Türkiye was granted observer status at the African Union in 2005 and ever since, its trade with Africa has surged from some US$ 5.4 billion to over US$41 billion as of end 2022. In the fourth Türkiye-African Summit in October 2023, it was noted that the diplomatic presence of Türkiye in Africa has increased to forty-four countries, while some 38 African missions were open in Ankara. The success of Türkiye in Africa is based on a win-win formula, which apparently the foreign policy of Türkiye, follows. It also supports Africa’s push to become a permanent member of the G20 through the AU or African Union and a reform of the United Nations Security Council. The attempt to mediate between Ethiopia and Somalia, which has not come to fruition as yet is again another manifestation of Türkiye’s interest in settling issues in the continent peacefully and maintaining peace and sustainable development processes in the continent instead of conflicts and wars. The footprints of Türkiye in Africa has so far been successful and welcomed in the continent. Every nation has its motivations and Türkiye’s growing relationship with Africa cannot be said to be devoid of Turkish interests and the same goes for the African partner countries and the continent as well. The relationship thus involves not only humanitarian aspects but also diplomacy, economic partnerships benefiting both parties and indeed, security issues involving not only arms supplies but also training and other technological supports. It works for both parties and should continue on the same rising gradient. The Horn of Africa States region is one of the main footprints of Türkiye in Africa. The region is a major geostrategic location, which attracts different powers. The governments of the region and particularly Somalia, with the weakest governance infrastructure, was confused with the powers that be in the world, be they from the West or the East and was looking for a helping hand with a different approach, which Türkiye fulfilled with ease. A new ten-year agreement between Somalia and Turkey on protecting Somalia’s waters and signed on February 8th, 2024, complimented by another agreement on a joint hydrocarbon exploration both offshore and onshore in the country, and other contracts involving the management of the airport and seaport of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia have been major features in Türkiye’s presence in the region. The bilateral approach of Türkiye has given it more freedom to make its presence felt not only in the region but further afield in the continent. They are now present in the Sahel belt and have helped the Ethiopian government fight off rebellions in the country through its supply of advanced drone technologies to Ethiopia. There are regional rivals as well as major power competitions in the region, noting that the region is not only a geostrategic location but is also a resource rich region. The United Arab Emirates is one such regional rival, which has had a long presence in the region since the collapse of the previous regimes of both Ethiopia and Somalia. The UAE had its own difficulties in both Eritrea and Djibouti which did not appreciate the way the small emirate was handling itself in the region. The UAE is now in Somalia’s Berbera and Bossaso ports which it manages through some agreements with both the regional authorities and the federal Government of Somalia. It is also reported that they have expressed interest in the port of Kismayo. Note that the region owns several deep ports unlike West Africa where deep ports are a rarity. The main successes of Türkiye in the region and Africa is related to its emphasis on development diplomacy unlike other powers whose main goals appear to be related to security and denying others of footholds. This has been received well not only in the Horn of Africa States but also in the rest of the continent, as far west as Senegal. The Türkiye approach involves an integrated approach to development and business, and peacebuilding and peace maintenance. This has worked well so far and contrasts with others who are more involved in security and fake humanitarianism through aid agencies (NGOs), which are more of a scourge on the region than help. Many fail to observe the changing continent and continue the old approaches which have failed both the continent and others. Africa’s population is growing, youthful and more educated and have access to as much information as is possible in the google world of today. The emerging young leaderships of West Africa in the Sahel belt and even southern Africa (Botswana) are but examples of what to expect in the future. They seem to be bent on taking control of the wealth of their nations and ready to deal with those who accept the new realities in good faith. Türkiye seems to be of this last category and uninterested in a new 'scramble for the continent' as many of the new Africa forums and summits are described.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRf_rEVaPdTk9	2024-11-14T09:27:49-08:00	
Turkmenistan Celebrates Its 29th Anniversary Of Neutrality: A Mod...	Understanding the Underlying Factors of State Neutrality On December 12, 1995, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring Turkmenistan’s status of permanent neutrality. This status was officially recognized and marked a significant milestone in the country’s modern history. Next year, Turkmenistan will celebrate the 29th anniversary of its neutrality. This day holds tremendous importance nationally, both for the Turkmen people and for international diplomacy. It is enshrined in the country’s constitution, for example in Article 2, where it states: 'The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan shall be the basis of its national and foreign policy.' And in Article 68, where it says: 'The president of Turkmenistan shall be the head of the state and executive power, the highest official of Turkmenistan, acting as guarantor of…state independence and the status of permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan…' (UN). Understanding State Neutrality This unique status aims to keep the country out of conflicts while promoting peace and international cooperation. The policy of neutrality is the set of political decisions and measures a neutral state freely takes in peace times with the aim of securing the credibility and efficiency of its legally binding neutrality. The policy of neutrality differs in neutral states and depends on their situation. Currently, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Ghana, and many other states are designated as neutral. However, all of them attained the status of neutrality to preserve themselves from the devastating effects of wars. Moreover, many states adopted neutrality policies during the Cold War era to avoid the political climate of the bipolar world. Turkmenistan chose neutrality after the Cold War ended, and it is the only state to adopt neutrality in peacetime, according to Kuru (2002). Historical Context of Turkmenistan’s Neutrality The origin of Turkmenistan’s neutrality dates back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when Turkmenistan gained its independence and quickly adopted a neutrality policy to avoid regional conflicts and external influences. This neutrality policy reflects a deep value of the Turkmen people: preserving and promoting their cultural identity while maintaining peaceful relations with other countries. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan began its political transition process. This process swiftly integrated the political culture of neutrality into the de-Russification process and as a strategy for building a post-Soviet state. From the moment of independence, the concept of neutrality. Initially, the concept of neutrality is more related to wars, where sovereign states adopt neutrality to avoid involvement in armed conflict between states. Neutrality was a response to the geopolitical instability in Central Asia. Indeed, the status of neutrality allowed Turkmenistan to remain outside military alliances and conflicts while conducting active diplomacy. According to Article 1 of the Constitutional Law of Turkmenistan on Permanent Neutrality: 'Within the scope of realizing the integral rights of the sovereign state, Turkmenistan declares voluntarily about its permanent neutrality and will support it and put into practice consistently. The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan is the basis of its foreign and domestic policy aimed at strengthening the stability and consent in society, developing friendly and mutually beneficial relations with the states of the region and the whole world.' (Constitutional Law of Turkmenistan on Permanent Neutrality, 1995) In July 1992, the former president of Turkmenistan, during the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, illustrated the strategy of positive neutrality. Former President Saparmurat Niyazov defined the key characteristics of neutrality as follows: • No interference in the internal affairs of other states. • The use of force should be avoided in interstate conflicts. • The role of the United Nations in maintaining global peace should be recognized. • Promoting cooperation in various sectors. • Alliances should be avoided, whether military or political. • Develop relations to maintain good relations, etc. (Ahmed, R-Q and al., 2018). There are also obligations under its neutrality status such as • Turkmenistan will not join any political, economic, or military alliance. • Military power will be limited to safeguarding freedom and stability. • Good relations with all states, regardless of their size, will be maintained. • The neutrality policy emphasizes friendship, mutual respect, equality, justice, mutual benefit, and the loyal fulfillment of all responsibilities and wishes. Turkmen Neutrality in Service of Diplomatic Relations 'The status of neutrality is a key factor for the development of Turkmenistan’s mutually advantageous and constructive international partnership that meets national interests as well as the goals to ensure peace, prosperity, and sustainable development in the region and throughout the world,' noted former President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. Therefore, Turkmenistan has established balanced diplomatic relations with major powers such as Russia, China, and the United States, while preserving its independence. Neutrality has allowed Turkmenistan to maintain good international relations with major powers. This neutrality has provided economic and diplomatic opportunities for Turkmenistan. It has enabled the country to develop economic relations with different partners while avoiding alignment with any military or economic bloc. The country has established bilateral relations with the United States, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, China, India, Pakistan, and many others. Turkmen Neutrality: An Asset on the International Stage In 2002, Mr. Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, served from 1997 to 2006, congratulated Turkmenistan for its support of the treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. Moreover, neutrality plays a crucial role in international organizations. Turkmenistan is a member of many international organizations, such as the UN, and advocates for peace and stability in the region. This is why UN Secretary-General António Guterres told journalists that 'Turkmenistan is playing a very important role in international relations,' particularly in cooperation with the UN. He was encouraged by the improved relations between Central Asian countries in the face of these challenges, and regional cooperation has deepened, once again highlighting the important role played by Turkmenistan. Conclusion In conclusion, Turkmenistan’s neutrality remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy, allowing it to navigate a complex international environment with a certain degree of independence. Over the past 29 years, this position has reinforced its role as a mediator and promoter of peace in the region. Next year, on December 12, 2025, Turkmenistan, the land of Ahal Teke horses, will celebrate its 30th anniversary of neutrality. Turkmenistan’s neutrality is a remarkable example of peace. Undoubtedly, Turkmenistan refuses to harbor or produce weapons of mass destruction, to be part of military pacts, to provoke conflicts, or to take sides in conflicts. This message of neutrality and peace is gaining increasing relevance in our decade, which faces the growing escalation of global conflicts. Bibliography Ahmed, R-Q and al., (2018).

In A Trumpian World – OpEd	Trump won but did America lose? Harris lost but did America win? What is being seen in America, and in many parts of the world, is a reconfiguration and reconstitution of many social beliefs. These had catalysed human progress but now in a Trumpian World are being turned on their heads. Therefore, today in this brave new world - Women's rights conflict with her identity – Both Trump and Harris focused on womanhood. Harris focussed on reproductive rights while Trump focussed on the transgendering of the identity of womanhood. Harris pointed to the threat of regressiveness, Trump discussed the dangers of progressiveness. That 3% fewer women voters voted for Harris in 2024 as compared to Biden in 2020 suggests that reproductive rights was not as important in this election as the threat to their identity based wellbeing. Majority Is the new minority – The phenomenon of the majority claiming to be a minority is growing across the world. This is communicated in many ways - 'way of life is threatened', 'demography is changing', 'jobs are being taken away'. There is a desire to maintain status-quo, which could be a response to the hyped-up socio-economic insecurities. That is the reason for Muslims being targeted in India; Roma's, Jews and LGBTQI being targeted in Hungary and, American's opposition to migrants and minorities. The rise of the rightwing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in Germany, and anti-migrant political parties in other parts of Europe is a consequence of these beliefs. Liberalism has become its own worst enemy – Many Rightwing issues are reactions to progressive endeavours and diktats. Unfortunately, equality, equity and rights for one group can cause uncertainty for another group. For example, many feminists oppose Transgender rights as they believe it goes against women's rights, socio-economic schemes for migrants reduces opportunities for natives and it goes on. Liberals wish to make society sustainable, inclusive, respectful, equitable, just and so on. They do so by focussing on the marginalised and historically disenfranchised. The Liberal idea includes giving a platform to the voiceless and holding truth to power. Undeniably, the scope of progressivism is extensive. Given this broad swathe that is focussed on, there is a possibility the liberal attention span is transient as they are forced to move from issue to issue – reproductive rights, migrant rights, welfarism, hate speech, peace, equal pay, and so on. For the lay person there is no common thread underlying these myriad issues thus making these efforts whimsical and disjointed. There seems to be an underlying liberal assumption that the process of changing the status quo will also educate people on the subject. The issue becomes the hot-topic and not the underlying beliefs that fuel the desire to shift the needle. Consequently, there is no effort to change the minds of the dis-interested and conservative. It is almost as if Liberals assume that everyone will come to terms with, and accept, changes instigated by them. Understandably, the response to these progressive endeavours is antagonism, distancing and disrespect. Liberals fight each other as there is no limit and definition of progressive and liberal values. The liberal ethos is individualistic - transgender versus feminism is an example. Lack of frameworks also results in shocking hypocrisy as seen in the Palestinian-Israeli, and Ukrainian-Russia conflicts. This is nutrition for the Right. Importantly, the Rightwing is attractive because it has a low threshold for their idea of victimhood and discontent. Let's not forget, Liberal work can result in 'othering' something Liberals rail against. Democrats looked down on Trump supporters, calling them members of a cult did nothing to help their cause. This mix of self-righteous outrage and snootiness further increases the divide and repels potential converts. Secularism has a Rightwing Version - Trump's victory indicates a coalescing of disparate Rightwing agendas and cabals. Here are a few - the Christian evangelists; the Hindu Right; Republican Jews, Hispanics and African-Americans; the Constitutionalists; the white-supremacists; the socio-economic Conservatives; the America-Firsters, the conspiracy theorists and Q-anon followers; the small-government and pro-business group; climate change deniers; crypto-promoters; the pro-life coalition; the anti-woke brigade; the 'save-masculinity' caucus; the second Amendmenters; the traditionalists; the anti-immigration bloc; free-speech preservers; the book banners brigade; fascists and so on. Trump has been able to get them to forget their inherent differences and opposing stances, and coalesce. However, the question remains about the duration that these natural enemies will peacefully live in Trump's Ark. Just as there is a Liberal Tower of Babel, a Tower of Babel of the Right is emerging. Courage is being redefined – The Indian businessman and one of the world's richest - Gautam Adani- congratulated Trump with 'If there is one person on Earth who stands as the embodiment of unbreakable tenacity......courage to stay true to his beliefs it is Donald Trump....'. He is not the only person to appreciate Trump's bigotry, sexism, childish prattle, petulance, criminality, lies, and view it as a virtue that is commendable, courageous and possibly emulatable. Trump's victory suggests a majority of Americans think so too, as do other rightwing world leaders. There is a difference between speaking one's mind whilst knowing and accepting the consequences, and speaking one's mind knowing there are no consequences. The latter is the version celebrated today. Many question whether Trump's victory is a defeat of morality. Maybe, like the stock-market undergoing a correction, Trump rising victorious from his morass is a correction of what humanity has held dear.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdp5VRQTAb3v	2024-11-14T09:24:19-08:00	
TTP And ISKP: Unraveling The Complex Web Of Militancy In South As...	Since the Taliban take over, the Afghanistan land has become a most volatile as many terrorists group have regained their strength under the patronage of Taliban regime. United States withdrawal from Afghanistan certainly have severe repercussions for the region. Since then, Afghanistan has faced a multifaceted security challenges and increased terrorist activities. The Taliban's return to power has created a power vacuum, reshaping security dynamics and impacting terrorism concerns on both regional and global levels. A major concern is the presence and activities of groups like ISIS-K (Islamic State Khorasan Province), which has taken advantage of the instability to expand its influence. ISIS-K has carried out numerous attacks targeting civilians, the Taliban, and neighboring countries, aiming to undermine Taliban control and promote its extremist agenda. Al-Qaeda, though weakened, also remains active in Afghanistan but has maintained a relatively lower profile. Meanwhile, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has found safe haven in Afghanistan, operating freely from the region to challenge the authority of the Pakistani state. The volatile security situation in Afghanistan affects neighboring countries like Pakistan, Iran, and the Central Asian states, heightening their concerns over potential cross-border terrorist threats. Additionally, the Taliban's limited governance experience and scarce resources have raised doubts about their ability to effectively curb terrorist groups and maintain control over the country. Globally, there is also fear that Afghanistan could once again become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations with transnational agendas, posing risks beyond its borders. Pakistan has repeatedly urged the Taliban government to take action against the TTP within Afghan territory, but significant cooperation has yet to materialize over the past three years. Pakistani authorities are deeply concerned about the TTP's operations from Afghanistan, emphasizing the threat it poses to Pakistan’s national security. Most terrorist incidents in Pakistan are attributed to the TTP, which maintains sanctuaries within Afghanistan. Pakistan has repeatedly shared intelligence with the Afghan government, providing specific details on TTP members’ locations and activities in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the TTP operates under the patronage of the Interim Afghan Government (IAG) due to its ideological and wartime linkages with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Afghanistan (TTA). Having supported the TTA during the war, the TTP now receives reciprocal support from the IAG. However, it is time for the Taliban government to understand that the continued presence of the TTP in their territory could strain bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is believed that the Afghan government is using the TTP as leverage against Pakistan. This approach allows the TTP to operate from within Afghan territory to exert pressure on Pakistan for political or strategic gains. The deaths of many TTP leaders and fighters in Afghanistan, along with their use of US weapons, confirm the TTP's presence there. International intelligence reports also verify these deaths and the use of US weapons, refuting Kabul's claims that the TTP is not operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan. The international community, including Chinese intelligence, acknowledges the presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan and their role in the Bisham attack on May 27, 2024. Despite the Supreme Afghan leader's decree against jihad outside Afghanistan, the TTP's non-compliance demonstrates their defiance of the Taliban government. The TTP has links with ISKP and other terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan. Moreover, Pakistan has been facing and fighting 'Khawariji terrorists' for the past two decades. These terrorists, while claiming allegiance to different groups, are essentially the same due to their Khawariji ideology of killing and destruction, which religious scholars have declared un-Islamic and haram. Although Khawariji groups like the TTP and ISKP appear to be at odds with each other, they are fundamentally alike, as both share a Khawariji ideology rooted in un-Islamic, inhuman, immoral, and barbaric practices based on a misinterpretation of Islamic teachings. ISKP consists of former commanders and militants of the TTP (the first Ameer of ISKP, Hafiz Saeed, was a well-known TTP commander from the Orakzai agency). Therefore, in addition to their shared ideology, their human resources, terrorist tactics, and targets overlap, confirming that these banned outfits are covertly connected. ISKP has demonstrated the capability to conduct attacks both within and outside Afghanistan, highlighting a strong operational network and recruitment strategy. The Taliban's insufficient counterterrorism efforts raise concerns about the potential for terrorist groups to plan and execute operations against U.S. interests and allies, suggesting that the threats emanating from Afghanistan have increased rather than diminished since the U.S. withdrawal. Both groups are foreign proxies and puppets of Pakistan’s enemies, used against Pakistan to serve the interests of their foreign masters. ISKP abhors the Afghan Taliban, engaging in physical confrontations with them and condemning them in propaganda campaigns. Strangely, however, it takes a softer approach toward the TTP, reinforcing the perception that they are collaborating at some level. No clashes between the TTP and ISKP have ever occurred, and both enjoy safe havens in Afghanistan without conflict or friction, supporting the notion that the TTP is using ISKP for deception. The Khawariji TTP perpetrates heinous terrorist attacks on civilian targets through ISKP to manage public backlash. While ISKP launches suicide bombers against religious scholars, mosques, religious gatherings, and groups, the TTP only claims responsibility for attacks on security forces. Both the Khawariji TTP and ISKP radicalize youth and coerce teenagers into committing 'haram' acts like suicide attacks; meanwhile, not a single terrorist leader has shown the courage to blow himself up with a suicide vest. The presence of the Khawariji TTP and ISKP in Afghanistan is well-documented, substantiated by various reports from security organizations and media outlets, including UNSC reports, U.S. and Western think tanks, among others. Pakistani religious scholars have unanimously declared these terrorist groups and their activities haram through the Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa, categorizing armed struggle within Pakistan as un-Islamic. Rather than remaining in denial, the Taliban government must collaborate with neighboring states to jointly combat and weaken the presence of the TTP and similar groups in Afghanistan. The prosperity and security of both Pakistan and Afghanistan are mutually dependent; thus, an insecure Pakistan means an insecure Afghanistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmReWeFEuPCrFf	2024-11-14T09:22:04-08:00	
Pakistan’s Strategic Reset With The US – OpEd	As the world braces for Donald Trump's second term as president, Pakistan finds itself at a critical juncture in its foreign policy and economic trajectory. While the return of a familiar face to the White House stirs its own brand of global anticipation, Pakistan sees this moment as an opportunity to reset, rebuild, and reassert itself on the international stage, particularly with respect to its relationship with the United States. The stakes are high, both for Pakistan’s domestic stability and its global positioning, especially given the turbulent history of US-Pakistan relations and the political challenges at home. The re-election of Donald Trump is notable not only for the political polarization it signifies in the US but also for the profound implications it holds for Pakistan, which continues to grapple with the legacy of past administrations’ foreign and domestic policies. While the Trump administration’s initial term was marked by sharp rhetoric and transactional diplomacy, Pakistan, like many others, hopes for a more constructive engagement in the years ahead. In this moment of global uncertainty, we are prepared to engage with the US in a manner that respects Pakistan’s sovereignty, acknowledges our efforts to combat terrorism, and supports regional stability. Pakistan has long played a pivotal role in the geopolitical dynamics of South Asia, particularly in the US-led war in Afghanistan. During Trump’s first tenure, despite the often contentious relationship, Pakistan proved to be a crucial partner in facilitating critical operations, particularly those related to the safe extrication of Afghans who had supported US forces. The role Pakistan played in facilitating peace talks, providing logistical support, and managing the delicate relationship with the Taliban was an essential component of the broader strategy that aimed to stabilize Afghanistan and secure US interests. Pakistan has also made significant contributions in the fight against terrorism, often at great cost to our own national security. Our army and intelligence agencies have been engaged in counterterrorism operations for over a decade, combating insurgents and militants that threaten both regional and global stability. As Pakistan continues its battle against extremism, we hope the new US administration recognizes and values the sacrifices Pakistan has made, especially in curbing terrorist networks operating across our borders. The relationship between the US and Pakistan has always been a balancing act—at times cooperative, at times fraught with tension. But the hope is that under Trump’s second term, this partnership can evolve into one of mutual respect, where both countries acknowledge each other’s interests and priorities, particularly with regard to Afghanistan, counterterrorism, and the broader quest for peace and security in the region. While Pakistan’s foreign policy challenges are significant, the internal political landscape is equally complicated. We face significant economic hurdles, a direct consequence of policy missteps by previous administrations. Over the last decade, Pakistan has struggled with fiscal instability, mounting debt, and a declining international reputation. These challenges were compounded by the policies of previous governments, which left the country isolated and burdened with unsustainable economic decisions. The current government recognizes that rebuilding Pakistan’s economy requires more than just fiscal adjustments—it demands strategic reforms, international cooperation, and a long-term vision for economic resilience. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, we are actively working to stabilize the economy, attract foreign investment, and restore Pakistan’s reputation as a reliable partner on the global stage. We are prioritizing infrastructure development, expanding our digital economy, and fostering an environment conducive to business growth. Our commitment to fiscal responsibility is underscored by ongoing efforts to meet the requirements set by international financial institutions, while also focusing on policies that will create sustainable jobs and improve the quality of life for our citizens. The government's focus on ensuring that economic policies serve the broader interests of the people, rather than narrow political agendas, will be crucial in navigating the current economic climate. As we move forward, Pakistan is keen to re-engage with the US administration on issues of mutual interest. Trade and economic collaboration should be at the center of this renewed relationship. For years, Pakistan’s economic potential has been stifled by a combination of internal mismanagement and external isolation. But as the world’s 25th-largest economy, Pakistan holds immense potential in sectors like agriculture, technology, energy, and services. With strategic international partnerships, we can unlock these opportunities and provide economic stability and prosperity for our citizens. At the same time, we must continue to assert our independence in decision-making. Pakistan is committed to engaging with the US and other global powers in a way that respects our sovereignty and prioritizes our national interests. This does not mean rejecting cooperation—it means approaching it with a sense of balance, ensuring that Pakistan’s priorities, particularly in terms of security and regional stability, are always at the forefront of any engagement. Pakistan is a country determined to move beyond the mistakes of the past. We are not blind to the flaws in our past policies, particularly those that exacerbated tensions with neighboring countries and the international community. However, Pakistan’s resilience is one of its defining features. Despite the economic setbacks and political challenges, our nation has weathered many storms, and we remain hopeful that with the right strategic guidance, we can overcome our current difficulties and emerge stronger. As we enter a new phase of engagement with the US, Pakistan must also look inward, working toward building a more transparent, inclusive, and accountable system of governance. This is not only critical for domestic stability but also essential in restoring international confidence in Pakistan as a reliable partner. The people of Pakistan, though weary from years of political instability and economic hardship, remain resilient and hopeful. They continue to believe in the potential of their country—a potential that has been stifled but is not yet extinguished. With the right international support, especially from strategic partners like the US, and a renewed commitment to internal reforms, Pakistan can return to the path of sustainable growth and development. In this new chapter, we call on the US administration, under President Trump, to engage with Pakistan as a partner in building a more stable, prosperous, and secure region. By doing so, we can turn the page on past grievances and focus on a future defined by collaboration, mutual respect, and shared goals.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRaH8jslmgCru	2024-11-14T09:20:11-08:00	
Northeast India: Obligatory 6 Assembly Seats Conduct By-Polls – O...	As the voting for by-polls in six assembly constituencies of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, obliged to fill up the vacant seats after all the legislators shifted their focus to the national politics, concluded peacefully on 13 November evening, the debates surfaced if the electoral exercises could have been prevented. The legislators, representing different political parties, participated and won in the recently conducted Lok Sabha polls and hence they had to resign from their respective assembly seats. The question definitely arises, why their party leaders selected them even though they were serving as legislators and whether it was not possible for them to break the cycle of repeated (often unwanted) elections for the sack of Indian tax payers' money! All the six seats (Assam-5 and Meghalaya-1) witnessed brisk voting by the electorates and the initial report suggests a voters' turn out of above 73 percent (out of cumulative 10 lakhs electorates). The fate of around 40 candidates (most of them are reportedly debutants) is now stored in the electronic voting machines, which will be opened on 23 November next. Along with these seats, by-polls for over 40 assembly constituencies (along with two Lok Sabha seats) in other parts of India are on the card along with the State assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand before the counting and result day. Assam's Samaguri assembly constituency remained in the media headlines for wrong reasons since the poll date was announced by the Election Commission of India. Frequent tussles between the supporters of various political parties were reported from the constituency in central Assam. Political violence even claimed the precious life of a BJP supporter and left many others injured. An incident of firing was also reported from Mari Puthikhaiti village targeting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Jitu Goswami. Three journalists were also allegedly intimidated by the Congress supporters. No doubt, a number of claims and counter-claims were raised by both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress leaders. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, also in charge of the State home portfolio, criticized the opposition Congress for resorting to violence under cover of darkness to frighten the BJP workers. The saffron leader however asserted that no one will be allowed to sabotage or undermine the democratic process in the State. It was responded to by the Congress leaders alleging that the BJP workers were creating troubles to garner support for their candidate in the by-polls. Samaguri assembly seat, represented by Congress veteran Rakibul Hussain for five consecutive terms, was vacated after he won Dhubri LS constituency (defeating AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal by over 10 lakh votes). Now Hussain wants to hand over the Muslim majority Samaguri constituency to his young son Tanzil Hussain. The ruling BJP also fielded a young leader and incidentally Diplu Ranjan Sarma was the only non-Muslim candidate in Samaguri as other parties (including Aam Aadmi Party) batted for minority leaders for the by-polls. As the Muslim-centric AIUDF avoided the electoral race in Samaguri, it's expected to be a frontal battle between the Congress and BJP candidates there. Dholai (SC) and Behali seats continue to be favourable for the ruling party, where the first one was vacated by Parimal Suklabaidya to fight successfully in LS polls from Silchar Parliamentary constituency and the second one was left by Ranjit Dutta to fight for Sonitpur LS seat fruitfully. The BJP has fielded Nihar Ranjan Das in Dholai (contested by Congress candidate Dhrubajyoti Purkayastha and others) and Diganta Ghatowal in Behali assembly constituency (electorally challenged by former saffron leader Jayanta Bora, Asom Sanmilita Morcha supported CPI(ML) candidate Lakhikanta Kurmi and others). Sidli (ST) assembly seat was vacated by Jayanta Basumatary (United Peoples' Party-Liberal) to get elected from Kokrajhar LS seat. Now Nirmal Kumar Brahma is fighting to retain the seat for the BJP ally against the challenges primarily from Congress nominee Sanjib Warle and Bodoland People's Front (BPF) candidate Suddha Kr Basumatary. Another important ally to the ruling BJP alliance Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) put Diptimoyee Choudhury for Bongaigaon seat against Brajenjeet Sinha of the Congress. A recent talk show, telecast by a Guwahati-based satellite news channel DY365, discussed various electoral issues reflecting in Assam ahead of the by-polls in five constituencies. Anchored by senior television journalist Snigdha Sikha, the show highlighted different perspectives of elections in the State with a serious observation that the electoral system in India needs an urgent reform. Joining the discussion, aired live and repeated telecast next day, this writer argued that all five assembly constituencies needed the polls as the legislators participated in the last general elections successfully and shifted their focus to the Parliament. It could have been evaded if the political parties prevented these legislators from fighting in the national polls till term is over. Senior media personality Adip Phukan expressed serious concern over the incidents of pre-poll violence in the State, which was otherwise unheard of across the region. He also remained critical to AGP leader Phani Bhusan Choudhury who had recently won from the Barpeta LS seat and thus a by-election was necessitated in his assembly constituency Bongaigaon. But surprisingly, the AGP put Choudhury's wife as the party nominee in the by-polls. Phukan lamented that Choudhury represented Bongaigaon assembly constituency for four decades together and when it was time to hand over the responsibility to another party leader he (also the leaders of AGP) could repose faith on a house wife only. Not only Choudhury, the same tendency was shown by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma also, as he put his wife Mehtab Chandee Agitok Sangma in the by-polls for Gambegre assembly seat. The ruling National People's Party (NPP) nominee Mehtab Chandee has been challenged in the electoral battle by the Congress candidate Jingjang Marak, BJP nominee Bernard Marak, Trinamool Congress candidate Sadiyarani M Sangma, etc. The by-election became necessary as the influential legislator Saleng A Sangma of the Congress joined the Lok Sabha as its member from Tura Parliamentary constituency (defeating CM Sangma's sister Agatha in the last general elections). The constituency in Garo hills locality recorded as high as over 90 % poll-turnout. The ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) won both the seats scheduled for by-polls in the tiny State as the opposition candidates withdrew their nominations. State chief minister Prem Singh Golay's son Aditya (Tamang) Golay won from Soreng-Chakung assembly seat as his lone opponent Prem Bahadur Bhandari of Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF, led by former CM Pawan Kumar Chamling) preferred not to contest. Similarly, Namchi-Singhithang seat went to Satish Chandra Rai as lone opposition candidate Danial Rai of SDF left the race. The 32-member Sikkim legislative assembly now slips to the complete domination of SKM with no space for the opposition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRXVFsszcuGR2	2024-11-14T09:18:10-08:00	
Glimpses Of Everyday Imperialism At Work In The China-USA Trade D...	The U.S.-China Business Council report on 'U.S. Exports to China 2023' reveals that $151.3 billion worth of American goods were exported to China, supporting over one million U.S. jobs. According to the American Bureau of Economic Analysis, an official U.S. government agency, 'In 2023, U.S. exports of goods and services to China were $195.5 billion, down 0.9% from 2022, while imports from China were $447.7 billion, down 20.6% from 2022. As a result, the trade deficit with China declined to $252.1 billion'. However, these economic facts and figures do not determine U.S. policy toward China. Instead, the neo-colonial and imperialist strategies led by the U.S. and Europe shape the nature of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The imperialist, colonial, and capitalist core finds an alternative model of development and economic growth neither acceptable nor tolerable. In the name of trade disputes, U.S. President Donald Trump has consolidated and further reinforced the anti-Chinese policies and sentiments shaped by American business elites and their think tanks, such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the American Enterprise Institute, the Atlantic Council, and others. These institutes, under the guise of research, often serve as the propaganda arm of the American ruling elites, represented by the U.S. government. Trump's second term is expected to be even more aggressively anti-China, particularly in terms of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and services. Trump has stated that 'tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,' Tariffs as an economic weapon used by imperialist countries like the U.S. and Western European nations to undermine and dismantle trading abilities of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Tariffs are the foundations of unfair trade practices led by the imperialist countries in the name of protecting domestic industries, innovation and intellectual properties. American and European consumers suffer the most because of anti-Chinese trade practices. However, these anti-Chinese tariffs are not intended to benefit American, European consumers or global economy. Instead, they aim to protect corporate profits by undermining high-quality, yet more affordable Chinese goods and services. The trade dispute is often framed as a trade war between the U.S. and China, a conflict that was both intensified and accelerated under Trump. According to Josh Lipsky, the ripple effects of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018 could have cost the global economy $700 billion. It is going to grow in the second term of Trump presidency. Who paid this huge cost? The simple answer is consumers—the working masses. The trade dispute between China and America led to rising consumer prices on goods and services provided by China. As a result, working people bore the brunt of the increased cost of living, paying more for everyday products that are essential to their lives. In a capitalist market society dominated by imperialists, both at home and abroad, who truly cares for the masses? The policies that shape this system often prioritise corporate profits over the well-being of ordinary people. American imperialism, along with its Western European allies, views the world primarily in terms of trade surpluses and deficits. These powers often use military conflicts to ensure the smooth flow of trade, free from any barriers imposed by governments in countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These imperialist powers provoke anti-China sentiments in the China’s neighbourhoods by forming military, strategic and economic alliances. President Trump, as a businessman, aligned himself with this imperialist market trajectory in world politics, seeking to undermine and dismantle any successful models of state-led economic development, such as China's. There is little distinction between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to containing China's growth and development. Both parties compete to be more anti-China, striving to outdo one another in their approach to the issue. The Biden administration, for instance, continued Trump's policies on China, even increasing tariffs and levies on Chinese products and services. The recently concluded election campaign further revealed that there was little difference between President-elect Biden and his opponent, Kamala Harris, in their stance on undermining China's alternative development model. Both Republicans and Democrats share a common approach when it comes to China, united in their efforts to curtail its rise. American and European consumers are the beneficiaries of Chinese trade but these countries frequently accuse China of unfair trade practices, aiming to undermine its competitive advantage and progressive subsidy policies. They also accuse the Chinese state of engaging in business espionage and technology theft, alleging violations of international trade agreements. However, there is no truth to these accusations. In reality, China has reformed its Foreign Investment Law to encourage technological cooperation based on voluntary, mutually agreed-upon rules that govern business investments. The law not only bans forced technology transfers but also protects the trade secrets and intellectual property of foreign investors. These false allegations are part of a broader strategy to undermine China and its creative, technological, and scientific capabilities, as well as the productive potential of its skilled workforce. American imperialism and its European allies have failed to acknowledge the failures of their capitalist models of development, which has led to a declining ability to meet their consumption needs through domestic production. Capitalism, driven by the pursuit of profit and mass consumerism, has undermined domestic industries, contributing to deindustrialisation in both Europe and America. The trade deficit is a direct result of this imbalance between production and consumption. In contrast, China's trade surplus is driven by its technologically advanced workforce, which produces more than it consumes. As a result, China exports more and imports less, leading to a trade surplus. Meanwhile, capitalist countries like the United States and those in Western Europe consume more than they produce, which causes their imports to exceed exports and results in trade deficits. In this context, imperialist nations are engaged in an economic war with China over trade surplus. However, this trade dispute does not serve the interests of people worldwide. The imperialist powers are deflecting attention from their own capitalist failures by unjustly blaming China for its development, which is fundamentally centered around the well-being of its people and people across the world. China should reconsider its approach to retaliating against imperialist market logic. Moving away from a corporate-driven market strategy based on tariffs and levies is crucial. Increasing tariffs on American and European goods does not benefit consumers in China, Europe, America, or anywhere else in the global market. Instead, China should focus on promoting worker-led cooperative business models and investment strategies, both domestically and internationally. By prioritizing these models, China can foster more equitable and sustainable economic relationships that serve the interests of workers and consumers worldwide, rather than continuing to rely on punitive trade measures designed by the neocolonial imperialist and their crony capitalists.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRfedSx_iNpPQ	2024-11-14T09:16:40-08:00	
Pakistan’s Economic Potential And Realities – OpEd	The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has made headlines with its remarkable performance, surpassing the 93,000-point threshold on November 8, 2024. This historic achievement not only underscores the resilience of Pakistan’s economy but also paints a hopeful picture of a stronger economic future. The PSX’s surge sends a loud and clear message: Pakistan is on an upward trajectory, attracting investor confidence, foreign capital, and paving the way for sustained growth. Crossing the 93,000-point mark is more than just a number; it represents a milestone of optimism and stability within Pakistan’s financial markets. This unprecedented rise in the PSX-100 Index reflects a renewed confidence among both local and international investors. The consistent upward trend indicates that the country’s economy is growing, moving past economic hurdles, and making significant strides toward long-term stability. For investors, this upward movement inspires confidence in Pakistan’s future, making the PSX a key player in the nation’s economic development. As the PSX reaches new heights, Pakistan’s capital markets have become an increasingly attractive destination for foreign investment. The surge in stock prices demonstrates an environment ripe for growth, appealing to both local and international investors seeking promising returns in emerging markets. Pakistan’s potential as a frontier market is being recognized globally, with institutional investors showing heightened interest in sectors like banking, technology, manufacturing, and infrastructure. This capital influx is crucial for strengthening Pakistan’s financial system, providing the country with the resources needed to fund ambitious infrastructure and energy projects essential for sustainable growth. The booming PSX is a testament to Pakistan’s untapped economic potential, highlighting an era of innovation and development across key industries. Sectors such as technology, finance, and manufacturing are witnessing significant growth, driven by the surge in stock market confidence. This growth creates opportunities for business expansion, job creation, and increased consumer spending. The benefits of a strong PSX performance ripple through the economy, enabling various sectors to flourish and contributing to the overall uplift of the nation’s economic landscape.

By fostering innovation and modernization, the PSX is helping to elevate Pakistan’s competitiveness on the global stage, transforming the country into a resilient and diversified economy. The impressive performance of the PSX is closely aligned with the government’s economic reforms, aimed at improving fiscal stability and creating an investor-friendly environment. Structural improvements, including regulatory reforms and transparent financial policies, have laid a solid foundation for a thriving economy. The current government’s focus on reducing bureaucratic hurdles and implementing business-friendly policies has played a pivotal role in creating this favorable environment. These reforms have not only attracted investors but also built a more stable economic framework, empowering businesses to grow and develop sustainably. The PSX’s success serves as an endorsement of the government’s commitment to economic progress and stability. The correlation between reforms and market performance illustrates how strategic policy decisions are paying off, bolstering confidence in Pakistan’s economic direction. The historic performance of the PSX also positions Pakistan to finance mega-projects that can drive long-term growth. As investor confidence in Pakistan’s market grows, the government gains access to crucial funding for infrastructure, energy, and industrial projects that will lay the groundwork for economic expansion. By securing capital for these projects, Pakistan can develop the infrastructure needed to support sustainable growth, such as improved transportation networks, energy generation, and enhanced urban planning. This financial capacity paves the way for Pakistan to unlock its full potential and develop a modern economic landscape. The PSX’s record-breaking rise to over 93,000 points symbolizes Pakistan’s economic resilience and capacity to overcome past obstacles. This achievement highlights Pakistan’s transformation into a competitive economy ready to seize new opportunities in global markets. As the country positions itself as a stable and promising investment destination, the PSX embodies Pakistan’s commitment to economic reform, modernization, and growth. The bullish trend in the stock market is more than a temporary high; it reflects an underlying strength in Pakistan’s economic fundamentals. With the market on an upward trajectory, Pakistan is well-placed to attract strategic partnerships and international collaborations that will further enhance trade and economic development. This performance signals that Pakistan is prepared to advance in the global financial arena and that its economy has the resilience to grow even in challenging times. The PSX’s impressive performance is a beacon of hope for Pakistan’s economic future, embodying the aspirations of a nation focused on growth, innovation, and prosperity. By achieving this historic milestone, Pakistan has proven itself as a promising frontier market, drawing the attention of investors worldwide. The PSX’s success aligns with the nation’s broader economic ambitions, signaling that Pakistan is ready to embark on a path of sustained progress. As Pakistan’s stock market soars, the country stands at the precipice of a brighter economic future, where growth, stability, and innovation pave the way for long-term prosperity. This landmark achievement is a testament to Pakistan’s potential, resilience, and commitment to building a robust economy that benefits all its citizens.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRZ1QDdc2Wg49	2024-11-14T09:15:28-08:00	
Moscow Hopes Bishkek Can Help Control Kyrgyz Migrant Workers In R...	Popular militias made up of immigrants have been forming across the Russian Federation in cities with significant diaspora populations. These militias are composed of both citizen and non-citizen migrants. Ostensibly, these militias are meant to work with police to enforce laws and keep the peace between these communities and the Russian majority. These groups, however, also defend these immigrant communities against Russian police and Russian nationalist groups such as the Russian Community (see EDM, October 15). These immigrant militias are becoming models for indigenous and Roma populations, groups that the Russian police have not always been able to control (Window on Eurasia, October 31). As a result, over the last several weeks, Moscow has quietly entered into agreements with Kyrgyzstan and possibly other countries to have officers come to the Russian Federation to work with these immigrant groups, an action Bishkek has acknowledged openly but Moscow has sought to downplay (T.me/mvd_official_kg, November 5; T.me/mediamvd, November 7). Amid the escalating tensions regarding immigrants, the Russian media’s approach to downplay the issue is understandable but no longer sustainable. After an article by Russian journalist Vladislav Maltsev appeared in Zavtra on November 10 entitled '’Kyrgyz Policemen’ and ‘National Militias’ are Already in Our Cities,' the Russian journalist pointedly asked whether the state was losing control of order (Zavtra, November 10). Maltsev’s article is sure to trigger a flood of commentaries in the coming days and may even put pressure on Moscow to change course, and thus making the issue worthy of close attention. According to Maltsev, 'migrant ghettos that have formed in many Russian cities and are already acquiring their own official security forces either in the form of militias created by the immigrants themselves or by foreign interior ministry offices who [with Moscow’s permission] have come to Russia in uniform.' (See Zavtra, April 14, 2021; EDM, October 22 for more on migrant ghettos in Russian cities.) Maltsev suggests that many Russians will be concerned about how these foreign officers are not being subordinated to Russian police, but have diplomatic immunity and can thus interact with migrants with little regard for Moscow. Specifically, he notes that Bishkek officials intend these representatives to work in an 'independent' and 'extraterritorial' fashion, much like European officials did in China in the 19th century, which will alarm a large swath of Russians. Such terms are alarmist and are intended to be. Maltsev says what is occurring in Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities such as Bratsk and Tyumen are far more disturbing and concrete. There, he reports, citing statements by local branches of the Russian interior ministry, ever more migrants, confronted by anti-immigrant moves from the Russian authorities and population, have sought to form ethnic militias. Adding that, to a lesser extent, similar trends are taking place in European Russia. The Russian authorities have told them that only citizens of the Russian Federation have the right to form militias, but that is less of an obstacle than many may think, Maltsev continues. Many migrants have now taken Russian citizenship, and Moscow has encouraged them to do so. Over the last two months, these migrants with Russian citizenship have been forming ethnic militias in cities east of the Urals. They now are going to be assisted by officers from Kyrgyzstan, raising the likelihood of new and larger clashes between these migrant groups and Russian nationalists, such as the Russian Community (Window on Eurasia, October 23; see EDM, October 15, 29). The danger of such clashes was highlighted last month in a suburb of Chelyabinsk, where Russian nationalist groups fought with Roma, who had taken control of local administrative bodies. This tension is increasingly found across Russia, where non-ethnic Russians, immigrant or indigenous communities, have assumed sufficient control over local institutions and feel free to ignore Russian laws and practices. This problem is only going to get worse, Russian journalist Kirill Shulika says. 'It is not surprising that already various groups such as ‘the Russian Community’ have emerged to assume the role of militias' and that these will grow as veterans of the war in Ukraine return home. (On that prospect more generally, see Window on Eurasia, September 15, 2023.) Moscow has been searching for some solution but has remained uncertain, although the agreement with the Kyrgyzstan interior ministry suggests it may now act on that more generally. Those who assume that the local police can handle this spreading problem are profoundly wrong. Instead, the fighting is likely to be not between the police and the closed diasporas but between the closed diasporas and militias that neither Moscow nor the regional governments will be able to control. If Moscow cannot come up with a more effective strategy, Shulika suggests, these trends will open the way to a war that will shake the Russian Federation to its foundations (Rosbalt, October 29). Moscow’s decision to allow interior ministry officers from foreign countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, to try to take control of this situation is an effort in that direction. Both that the Kremlin is feeding demands among immigrants for the formation of their own militias and that Russian officials are playing all this down suggest that such Russian invitations to foreign police forces are an act of desperation. Moscow will either have to reverse course or face even more problems ahead. Despite all the Putin regime’s coercive resources, it is unavoidable that Moscow is losing control of the streets and districts of Russian cities to militias, both Russian and non-Russian.

Japan: Shigeru Ishiba Reconfirmed As Prime Minister Amid Politica...	By Pratnashree Basu Japan’s domestic politics are experiencing a turbulent phase with a loss of public support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has been in power since the Second World War. This loss of support can be attributed to ongoing inflation and rising costs of living, political corruption, an ageing society and a shrinking workforce. The results of the recent elections in late October reflect public frustration, with the LDP losing a majority vote share for the first time in a decade, prompting a special National Diet session on 11 November to elect the country’s Prime Minister. The LDP’s support rating dropped significantly, with Shigeru Ishiba’s cabinet’s approval falling as low as 34 percent in recent polls, prompting the LDP to court the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) for parliamentary support ahead of the prime ministerial vote on 11 November. Though the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner Komeito retained the largest bloc in Japan’s recent election, they lost their lower house majority held since 2012, leaving Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reliant on smaller opposition parties to advance his policies. This fragility was highlighted when Ishiba’s confirmation vote went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, reflecting tenuous support within the National Diet. Nonetheless, as the party with the most votes, Japanese lawmakers reconfirmed Shigeru Ishiba as Prime Minister in the special Diet session. Why Ishiba called for snap elections Ishiba’s decision to hold snap elections on 27 October 2024 was driven by the ongoing party finance scandal, involving unreported political funds, that had already weakened support for the LDP. To avoid further erosion of confidence, Ishiba aimed to dissolve the Diet immediately after fulfilling formal obligations, including his administration policy speech and responding to party representatives' questions. The quick election was intended to secure public confidence before the administration’s image deteriorated further, as it was crucial for the LDP not only to retain a majority but also to avoid losing seats, as the prolonged debate over the scandal could lead to more losses. The LDP, which has governed Japan for a decade despite frequent leadership changes, was poised to winagain due to low voter turnout and a divided opposition. This, along with support from its coalition partner, Komeito, made their victory highly likely. Relying on Komeito to secure a majority gives the party more influence over the LDP’s policies. Komeito has historically resisted some of the LDP's hawkish security measures, such as acquiring longer-range missiles and lifting restrictions on weapons exports, which have prevented Japan from sending arms to Ukraine or Southeast Asian nations opposing China's claims in the South China Sea. The general election was thus a critical test for PM Ishiba. The main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), had just chosen Yoshihiko Noda as its leader and was believed to be ill-prepared for the election, especially with the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) contesting over a hundred constituencies. This split the opposition vote, potentially reducing seat losses for the LDP. A majority win would have strengthened Ishiba’s position within the LDP and could have boosted public support, helping to mitigate the fallout from the party finance scandal. Many LDP members of parliament (MP), therefore, backed the early election to swiftly stabilize the political landscape. The road ahead However, the general election left the country in political uncertainty, primarily due to unexpected losses for the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Ishiba. The failure to secure a majority in the lower house of parliament marked a significant shift in Japan's political landscape. This election, triggered by Ishiba’s attempt to consolidate power amid scandals surrounding political funds, resulted in gains for opposition parties such as the CDP and the DPP. While the LDP and Komeito won the most seats in the election, they must now rely on smaller opposition parties to pass legislation, signalling a tenuous and complicated road that the administration must now navigate. This new dynamic has a range of implications. For one, it could stymie the legislative progress, impacting policy continuity on key issues like economic recovery, security, and defence reforms—particularly as Japan seeks to bolster its defence capabilities in light of regional tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The election also raises uncertainties about the Bank of Japan’s ongoing monetary tightening, as any political reshuffling can interfere with planned financial policies aimed at tackling Japan’s economic challenges like inflation. Additionally, the political instability may strain Japan’s external relations and its commitments to regional security cooperation, especially with allies like the United States. These developments come at a time when Japan faces critical security challenges related to China's assertive posture in the East China Sea and the broader Indo-Pacific​. Ishiba is expected to introduce a new cabinet soon with Keisuke Suzuki likely to be the justice minister, Taku Eto as agriculture minister, and Komeito’s Hiromasa Nakano as land minister. Other posts will likely be retained by members from Ishiba’s previous cabinet. Ishiba’s immediate challenges include finalising a supplementary budget to address rising costs of living, likely needing backing from the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) whose leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, is also facing personal scandals. While the disunity among opposition parties, which are divided on major issues and failed to rally around an alternative candidate for prime minister, may prove to serve as an advantage for him, Ishiba certainly has a difficult road ahead. Party lawmakers are also reportedly pressuring Prime Minister Ishiba to consider resigning after next spring’s budget clears. With Upper House elections scheduled for next year, the ruling coalition's slim majority may further weaken unless Ishiba can rebuild public trust, which the finance scandal has shaken. LDP Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama addressed criticism regarding the party’s response to the political funds scandal, emphasizing that it was managed rigorously. He noted, however, that the LDP has struggled to convey this to the public, who perceive the issue as involving 'slush funds' and 'tax evasion.' With Ishiba set to continue as the Prime Minister, Japan’s previous foreign and security policies are likely to continue. However, domestically, Japan’s political future will depend significantly on the ability of the ruling coalition or any new alliances to stabilize the government, navigate internal divisions, and build a coherent policy framework in a politically fragmented Diet.

Transatlantic Energy Security From A Baltic Perspective – Analysi...	By Justina Budginaite-Froehly (FPRI) -- Years before Russia started its full-scale war against Ukraine, the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, correctly assessing the Russian threat, implemented far-reaching reforms to end their energy dependence on Russia. Successful implementation of multiple infrastructural projects and energy market liberalization significantly improved Baltic energy security. It made the region a role model for the rest of Europe. Further energy security upgrades are planned in the coming months when the Baltic states will desynchronize their electricity grids from the Russia-controlled IPS/UPS electricity system in February 2025. While celebrating these noteworthy achievements, the Baltic states and their NATO allies should be aware of the potential increase in Russian gray zone activities that could be directed against further consolidation of the European energy security stronghold in the Baltics. Baltic Energy Security Upgrades In terms of energy security, the Baltic states were an isolated energy island until 2014. Having no access to European electricity and gas networks and being heavily dependent on energy imports from Russia, they were exposed to Russia’s political blackmailing and interference in domestic politics. The game-changer was Lithuania’s decision to install an LNG terminal on its Baltic coast. Despite active pressure from Russia, Lithuania successfully implemented the project and at the same time carried out far-reaching reforms to liberalize its gas market, forcing Russia’s Gazprom out of the Lithuanian energy sector. Similar, albeit less principled, measures were also taken in Latvia and Estonia. While being quite an unusual project at a time when most of the European countries were still comfortable with fostering and even deepening their energy 'partnerships' with Russia (Germany’s decision to install the Nord Stream 2 pipeline serves as the best example), the Lithuanian LNG terminal brought the full spectrum of positive effects from short-term gas price reductions to the long-term ability to serve regional and broader European energy security interests. The Baltic states’ geo-economic shift in terms of energy supplies was remarkable. Having covered all its natural gas needs with imports from Russia back in 2013, Lithuania, followed by Latvia and Estonia, became the first European country to ban all Russian gas imports, including its LNG, in April 2022 as a reaction to the invasion of Ukraine. Other European countries, despite Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine, remain eager consumers of Russian gas and have even increased the import volumes of Russian LNG by 11% year over year in the first half of 2024. The fully operational LNG infrastructure in the Lithuanian seaport Klaipėda and well-established partnerships with LNG suppliers, mostly from the US and Norway, enabled Lithuania’s, and the wider Baltic region’s, principled energy policy and their smooth transition from Russia to other gas suppliers. Having become one of the first European importers of US LNG in 2017, Lithuania’s LNG imports from the US peaked in 2022, making the US the leading LNG supplier for Lithuania and setting a clear sign that increased transatlantic cooperation was the right answer to Russia’s aggression and destabilization attempts. In the first six months of 2024, Lithuania’s LNG imports were almost equally split between the US and Norway as the two main suppliers. In addition to the Lithuanian LNG terminal that symbolically holds the name 'Independence,' further infrastructural upgrades in the Baltics followed, strengthening the region’s leading role in European energy security efforts even further. The recent completion of the Enhancement of Latvia-Lithuania interconnection project (ELLI) provided Lithuania with better access to the Inčukalns underground gas storage (UGS) in Latvia, which is unique in the region, serving the function of a crucial gas backup facility. The Baltic countries fill the storage in summer when gas prices are low to avoid gas shortages in winter when both gas consumption and its prices increase significantly. At the same time, the bidirectional ELLI pipeline allows increasing gas flows from the Lithuanian LNG terminal to Latvia and Estonia. The importance of the Gas Interconnection Poland–Lithuania (GIPL), which has been operational since May 2022, cannot be overstated. The bidirectional pipeline serves as the key element of the European North-South gas corridor connecting the Baltic region and Finland with Continental Europe. It further diversifies the Baltic countries’ gas import routes and opens new possibilities for exploiting Lithuania’s LNG terminal as an entry point for LNG to the European gas market. A recent agreement between Slovakia and Poland to bring LNG originating from the US through the Klaipėda LNG terminal, where Poland’s oil and gas company Orlen has secured long-term capacity, and further onwards through GIPL and the Vyrava interconnector between Poland and Slovakia from January 2025, marks the changing geo-economic realities in the region. Instead of using the traditional East-West interconnection originating in Russia and going through Ukraine, Slovakia will be supplied with natural gas from the North for the first time by using this new route. This is a crucial step forward for the country as its traditional gas supply route originating in Russia and passing Ukraine in transit counts its last days as the gas transit contract between Russia and Ukraine comes to an end on January 1, 2025. Beyond dismantling dependencies on Russian gas, the Baltic states are about to get rid of remaining links with Russia in the electricity sector, too. Currently, the Baltic countries are connected to Russia on the power system level, but in February 2025, they will disconnect their grids from the so-called BRELL electricity ring, which has provided unified terms for grid operation in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, and Russia within the Russia-controlled centralized dispatch of Integrated Power System/Unified Power System (IPS/UPS). After a decade-long preparation, the Baltic states will finally synchronize their electricity grids with the Continental European Network (CEN). To achieve this goal, multiple power interconnectors with Finland (Estlink 1 and 2), Sweden (NordBalt), and Poland (LitPol Link) have been installed on- and offshore, allowing the Baltic states to halt electricity trade with Russia and Belarus. All of these changes in the Baltic energy landscape have significantly increased regional and European energy security. But exactly because of their central role in consolidating the North-South energy corridor that will contribute to eliminating Russia’s role as an energy supplier to Europe, the new infrastructural installations — Klaipeda LNG terminal, gas pipelines, and power cables — risk becoming a target of Russian gray zone activities. Russia and its allies China and Belarus already have a long list of hybrid involvement in the Baltic states and Poland that ranges from damaging Balticconnector, an underwater gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia, to orchestrating a migrant crisis in the border region between Belarus, Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, among multiple other hostile actions. Kaliningrad as a Security Factor for the Baltics In light of current energy security upgrades in the Baltic states, Russia can be expected to try to exploit any opportunity to harm their progress in advancing the consolidation of the North-South energy corridor. The fact that the last ties of the Baltic states to Russia are cut might provide additional motivation for Russia to increase its hybrid activities in the region. The Kaliningrad exclave, with its geography and high militarization level constituting a permanent security threat to the Baltic states, might become an important focal point in this respect. With the Baltic states’ energy supply routes switching from the East-West to North-South, the Kaliningrad exclave is becoming an isolated energy island. Situated on the Baltic coast between Lithuania and Poland and separated from mainland Russia by the territories of Lithuania and Belarus, Kaliningrad is traditionally supplied with energy through the Lithuanian territory. It is also (still) an integral part of the BRELL electricity ring via the Baltic states’ grids, but with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia leaving the BRELL agreement in February 2025, Kaliningrad will be left to operate in an isolated regime. In preparation for desynchronization by the Baltic states, isolated operation tests have been carried out annually in the Kaliningrad power grid since 2019. Even though the official Russian position states that the exclave is ready for the upcoming changes, the fact that the power system stability in Russia and Kaliningrad will not be tied to the situation in the Baltics anymore might encourage Russia to increase its pressure on the Baltics through provocations and sabotage. One of the most likely Russian hostile measures is expected to be oriented toward testing the Baltic states’ and NATO’s resilience to increased levels of propaganda, accentuating the need to defend the economic and security interests of Kaliningrad amid the shifting geo-economic realities in the region. Similar claims concerning the enforcement of EU sanctions on the supply of certain goods to Kaliningrad via Lithuania by rail have already caused unrest in the EU. Increased attempts to sabotage Baltic energy infrastructure can be expected a year later when Lithuania’s long-term gas transit contract with Gazprom will run out in December 2025. After losing its stable pipeline gas supply through the Lithuanian territory, Kaliningrad will be exclusively supplied by Russian LNG through the Kaliningrad LNG terminal and supported by an underground gas storage facility. This will increase the presence of Russian LNG vessels in the Baltic Sea, leading to the growing risk of targeted damage to the Baltic states’ offshore energy infrastructure. Given the exclave’s proximity to the NATO members Lithuania and Poland, other security risks, such as increased spying attempts as witnessed in the case of the Russian shadow oil fleet off the coast of Gotland, should also be taken into consideration. Conclusion Two main conclusions can be drawn from the Baltic success story in transforming the region into a European energy security stronghold. First, the transatlantic partnership in the energy domain is crucial for Europe in changing its gas trade patterns. With stable imports of US LNG, the North-South energy corridor has emerged as a strategically important solution for energy security issues in Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. It is, therefore, fatally wrong to halt new gas export permits for US LNG exporting companies in such a crucial stage of geo-economic re-orientation in Europe. Second, energy security strategies are only semi-mature if they are not backed with appropriate measures of energy infrastructure protection. Although NATO is moving in the right direction strengthening its role in this area, there is still much room left for Russia’s malign strategies, especially in the contested Baltic Sea, where Russia’s concerns over the energy security of Kaliningrad might soon emerge as a new justification for its increased presence along the Baltic shores. It is clear that for the Baltic energy security stronghold to withhold the pressures from Russia and expand toward consolidating the North-South energy corridor in Europe, the transatlantic commitment to shared political, economic, and security goals must adapt to a new security environment while pro-actively pursuing its strategically important geo-economic agenda.

Sri Lanka’s Political Elite Fails To Gatekeep Change – Analysis	By Roshni Kapur The victory of Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Sri Lanka’s 21 September 2024 presidential elections signals more than a domestic shift towards anti-incumbency and popular discontent with mainstream politics. It also reflects a global trend where non-elite actors are disrupting established institutions by assuming power and promising to bring deep structural change. In Sri Lanka’s case, traditional political gatekeepers were unable to prevent the National People’s Power (NPP) party’s rise to power. Dissanayake’s victory marks a fundamental shift in Sri Lankan politics. In an unprecedented move, neither of the two main parties — the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, or their alliances or political offshoots — managed to regain power. Previously on the fringes of mainstream politics, the NPP has promised to change the political culture by ending patronage, corruption, authoritarianism, public sector waste and poor decision-making. Dissanayake is the leader of both the NPP and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a former insurgent group that attempted to capture state power through rebellion in the 1970s and 1980s. The JVP transformed into a mainstream political party under new leadership in the 1990s and its decision to establish the NPP in 2019 represents a strategic rebranding to distance itself from its turbulent past. As head of the party, Dissanayake exemplifies this new generation of reformist young leaders committed to democratic processes, with his assumption of power marking the start of a new political culture that promises to be inclusive, representative and democratic. The NPP’s electoral transformation is noteworthy. After securing little more than three per cent of votes in the 2019 presidential elections, Dissanayake won the competitive contest of the 2024 elections. This turnaround stems from several factors. Although democratic backsliding has been taking place for years in Sri Lanka, the militarisation and further centralisation of power during COVID-19 has greatly eroded civil liberties and democratic freedoms, leading to further deterioration of social, political and economic crises. The Aragalaya protest movement in 2022 triggered a fundamental shift, managing to compel former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. But it lacked the political power to bring institutionalised change and enabled Rajapaksa’s successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to use repressive measures and revive the old order. Yet the movement’s momentum continued, enabling the NPP to advance demands for political change through democratic processes. Repeated postponements of local government polls gave the NPP time to strengthen its presidential campaign and ascend as a formidable electoral contender. The NPP’s strong anti-corruption campaign also allowed the party to effectively position itself as the champion of a principled political order. Leveraging strong anti-incumbency sentiment and public mistrust of the dominant elite and state institutions that are seen as corrupt, self-serving and deeply politicised, the NPP promised to transform state institutions and reverse decades of institutional decay. The rise of a political contender from a non-traditional party is not unique to Sri Lanka but part of a wider pattern occurring in many democratic states which has seen power shifting from mainstream actors to newcomers outside of elite politics. These newcomers challenge the legitimacy of traditional elites by accusing them of corruption, nepotism and patronage, convincing their support base that the current order lacks democratic and inclusive values. Political elites usually employ two strategies to prevent a loss of power and relevance. They might attempt to harness the newcomer’s potential and outmanoeuvre political rivals through co-option, though this type of devil’s bargain usually benefits the outsider by providing them with sufficient support to become legitimate actors in a bid to govern. Alternatively, political elites gatekeep by spreading false or exaggerated narratives to marginalise a political outsider, including by forging alliances with rivals to prevent the novice from entering mainstream politics. This tactic was used in Sri Lanka — false narratives were spread that the NPP had instigated violence during the Aragalaya and that it intends to monopolise all sectors. But these propaganda tools were unsuccessful in socially and politically marginalising the NPP. The JVP’s transformation from an insurgent group into a political party and the subsequent formation of the NPP not only showcases its resilience to survive as a social entity but also its ability to adapt to changing domestic and global shifts. The NPP understands that it needs to go beyond its core voter base to gain broader support, including by adopting a more inclusive approach to overcome decades of deep mistrust within minority groups. Despite the inter-ethnic and inter-religious solidarity during the 2022 protest movement, the country continues to be divided along ethnic and linguistic lines. Dissanayake’s government is currently enjoying a honeymoon period that could bring a marginal victory at the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for 14 November 2024. But there are doubts on whether the NPP can secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority and more broadly, whether the government will continue the path of constitutional and political reforms or lose momentum as elite actors seek to delegitimise it. These actors will likely stress the NPP’s lack of political experience and the JVP’s violent past as the party attempts to lead the country to full economic recovery, navigate great power relations and strengthen engagement with minority groups.

Biden’s Economic Time Bomb: A Warning To Trump – OpEd	By Daniel Lacalle The insane neo-Keynesian policies implemented by the Biden-Harris administration have created persistent inflation and record levels of debt with two objectives: to bloat Gross Domestic Product and jobs with public spending and government jobs. The United States’ insane inflation is solely due to out-of-control spending and currency printing. Corporations, wars, or supply chains cannot cause aggregate prices to rise, nor can they consolidate the increase even at a slower pace. Although this can have an impact on individual prices, the only factor that causes aggregate prices to rise year after year is the decline in the value of the US dollar that the government issues. Over 20.5% accumulated inflation over the past four years, government deficit spending has reached nearly $2 trillion annually despite record tax receipts and a growing economy, public debt has reached almost $36 trillion, and the monthly job figure includes an astonishing 43,000 new government jobs each month. In 2023, nearly 25% of all job gains were government ones, and the entirety of the growth of the labor force in the past four years came from foreign workers. The latest jobs figure is so poor it seems disingenuous to blame it on hurricanes and strikes, as if economists and forecasters had not considered those two factors in their estimates. Furthermore, the only factor that continued to increase uncontrollably was the number of government jobs, adding 40,000 new positions to an overall total of just 12,000 jobs. No wonder the labor participation rate and employment-to-population ratios remain below 2019 levels. Furthermore, in the latest GDP figure, government spending accounted for 30% of the annualized growth, while investment was basically stagnant. In the past nine quarters, government spending has been one of the top drivers of GDP growth, and its contribution to GDP in the third quarter of 2024 was the largest in a year. This is upside-down economics in full swing. Private sector investment weakness, higher taxes for the productive economy and government spending and debt driving the economy. Of course, this never ends well. The Harris-Biden administration arrived in January 2021, when the economy was bouncing back strongly. Instead of allowing the private sector to thrive, it embarked on a strategy of out-of-control spending and tax increases with two objectives: increase the size of government in the economy so much that the next administration would be unable to reduce it enough in four years. The second objective was to bloat growth and job figures so aggressively that the next administration will see a recession if it reduces public sector growth. You may ask yourself why they would do it if Harris intended to win the elections. If Kamala Harris wins, she will continue to expand the size of government, inflate prices through spending and printing, and blame companies and stores for these actions. The Biden-Harris administration has left a massive time bomb for Trump and Elon Musk’s government efficiency office if they win. It will be almost impossible to avoid a recession if they cut discretionary spending and eliminate duplicate jobs. It is the same strategy that the socialists followed in Greece, Spain, and France, by the way. However, the socialist strategy may backfire. The evidence is that citizens do not value Biden’s policies and the state of the economy. The approval rate regarding the economy is atrociously low, 39.8%, according to RCP. United States citizens do not believe that they are better off than in January 2021. Inflation, immigration, and rising taxes have crippled small businesses and families. Furthermore, a strong pro-growth strategy and lower taxes will likely boost the dormant investment figure, create jobs in the private sector, and help small businesses achieve critical mass and grow. In Argentina, Milei recognized the necessary actions and cautioned the citizens about the inevitable reduction of the bloated state. The Kirchner socialists left a more significant time bomb legacy than what Trump might inherit. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Lower inflation led to lower taxation, an eight-month budget surplus, and rapidly improving public finances. The biggest risk for the United States economy and the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency is out-of-control public spending and constant currency printing added to tax hikes. Healing public finances and reducing government jobs may have a temporary negative impact on GDP, but higher exports, investment, and private sector jobs will likely compensate for it, and the result will be better for the US dollar and American citizens. More government is always poorer citizens. The potential of the United States economy’s private sector is much greater than the short-term negative impact of efficiency and budget control on headline GDP.

Malaysia Energy Profile: Second-Highest Producer Of Petroleum And...	Malaysia is the second-highest producer of petroleum and other liquids in Southeast Asia and the fifth-highest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) globally in 2023. Malaysia is strategically located in the South China Sea and borders the Malacca Strait, both of which are important maritime routes for energy trade.1 Malaysia’s oil and natural gas production is expected to peak at 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) in 2024, according to national oil company Petronas.2 This would be an increase of just over 200,000 BOE/d from the 1.79 million BOE/d produced in 2023.3 Malaysia’s national oil company Pertonas, with Enilive and Euglena, will build Petronas’s first biorefinery. The biorefinery, which will be located at the Pengerang Integrated Complex, will produce 12,500 barrels per day (b/d) of sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Construction will begin at the end of 2024, and commercial operation is slated to start in 2028.4 According to Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap, Malaysia plans to achieve a 70% share of installed electricity generation capacity for renewable energy by 2050. The government estimates it will need $143 billion in investments to meet its target. To help develop its renewable sector, Malaysia lifted its ban on renewable energy exports that it initiated in 2021.5 The increase in demand for renewable energy from foreign markets will prompt development of domestic renewable generation capacity on a larger scale to meet the higher demand. Petroleum and other liquids In 2023, Malaysia had proved oil reserves of 2.7 billion barrels—the second-largest oil reserve in the Southeast Asia. Although reserves have declined since 2022, there were 19 new discoveries in 2023, which could add over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to Petronas. Of these discoveries, 16 are located in the Sarawak state, and 3 are in the Sabah state.7 Following the Malaysia Bid Round 2023 (MBR 2023), six production sharing contracts and one discovered resource opportunity (DRO) were awarded. A DRO is an opportunity where a company can obtain the rights to an undeveloped discovery from a government to invest in its development. All offshore blocks for MBR 2023 in Sarawak and Northwest Sabah Basins are now licensed as a result of this bid round.8 In the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021–2025), the government outlined its plan to reduce carbon intensity economy-wide by 45% from 2005 levels against gross domestic product (GDP) and to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To support these goals, Petronas plans to cap operational emissions at 49.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in its Malaysian operations by the end of 2024. Petronas and its subsidies has also targeted a 50% reduction from 2019 levels in methane emissions from its natural gas value chain by 2025.9 Block nameCompanyBlock PM342Petronas; E&P Malaysia VentureBlock PM428Jadestone Energy; PetronasBlock SK330Petronas; E&P Malaysia Venture; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock SK510Petronas; INPEX Malaysia E&P; Pertamina; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock 5EShell; Petronas; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock SB403Petronas; E&P Malaysia Venture; SMJ EnergyBamabazon ClusterE&P O&M ServicesData source: World Oil From 2024 through 2026, Petronas expects more than 25 wells (oil and natural gas) to be drilled per year.

According to SampuraOMV, the project will reach peak production in 2030 at 550 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and 15,000 b/d of condensate. The project will supply the Petronas LNG complex in Bintulu via a 50-mile pipeline.20 The complex consists of MLNG Satu, MLNG Dua, MLNG Tiga, and MLNG T9. Shell operates the Timi natural gas project, which is located in Sarawak. Shell expects the project to produce 300 MMcf/d at peak production. The natural gas will support a production hub, located off the shore of Sarawak, via a 50-mile pipeline. Commercial production is slated to start in 2025.21 The Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area is located in the Gulf of Thailand and overseen by the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority; each country has 50% ownership of the area’s resources. The area produced natural gas for both Malaysia and Thailand and is linked to Malaysia via the Peninsular Gas Utilization (PGU) pipeline network.22 The industrial sector’s natural gas consumption share surpassed the power sector’s share in 2017 and has remained the top natural gas-consuming sector since that year. The Malaysia natural gas pipeline network, which has helped the manufacturing sector grow, is a major supplier for industrial natural gas consumption. Residential, commercial, and transportation sectors together have accounted for less than 1.5% of natural gas consumption per year from 2013 to 2022.23 Malaysia has one of the most extensive natural gas pipeline networks in Asia. Much of the natural gas pipeline network is located in Peninsular Malaysia and is known as the Peninsular Gas Utilization (PGU) pipeline network. The PGU is 1,630 miles long and can transport 3,500 MMcf/d. The network transports processed natural gas to the power sector and to non-power end-use sectors and exports natural gas to Singapore. The four entry points into the PGU are in Kertih, Pengerang, Sungai Udang, and Thailand.24 A floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessel called ZFLNG is under development off the shore of Sabah. The facility’s liquefaction capacity is 2 million metric tons per year, and its completion is set for 2027.25 Petronas and MISC Group signed an agreement in October 2023 that will convert a 4.9-million-cubic-foot LNG shipping vessel into floating storage for the Pengerang LNG terminal. The conversion is scheduled to be completed by 2025.26 Malaysia has limited coal resources. Its reserves were 249 million short tons in 2022.27 Nearly 99% of the reserves are located in Sarawak, and the remainder is in Sabah.28 In 2022, coal made up 21% of Malaysia’s primary energy consumption.29 Under the National Energy Policy 2022–2040, Malaysia’s goal is to reduce coal’s share of primary energy supply to 17% by 2040.30 Malaysia’s coal production decreased 4% in 2023. This came after an increase of almost 20% the previous year, from 3.4 million short tons in 2021 to a record 4 million short tons in 2022.31 Electricity Malaysia’s electricity generation increased 8% from 2021 to 194 terawatthours in 2022. Fossil fuels made up 81% of all electricity generated in 2022, and non-hydroelectric renewables made up less than 2%. Although total generation increased in 2022, the increase was dispersed evenly across most generation sources.32 In 2022, Malaysia pledged not to build any new coal power plants after 2040. In 2021, they created a phase-out plan to reduce existing coal capacity by 50% by 2035 and completely by 2044.33 Currently, 5 coal-fired power plant projects are under development, which are slated to come online by 2031 and will add 11.7 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.34 In April 2024, Malaysia’s government announced its intention to create the Energy Exchange Malaysia (ENEGEM) to export electricity from renewable sources to other Southeast Asian countries. ENEGEM aligns with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) goals of an integrated power grid among Southeast Asian countries.35 Malaysia’s installed electricity capacity remained relatively flat in 2022; it increased less than 1% from 2021 levels. All added capacity came from growth in solar installations.36 Energy Trade Malaysia’s crude oil and condensate exports decreased by 14% in 2023 from 2022. The largest declines by importing countries were China and India, which represent a combined decrease of 29,000 b/d.37 Virtually all of Malaysia’s crude oil and condensate exports in 2023 went to the Asia Pacific region. Southeast Asia was responsible for 52% of imports.38 Malaysia imported almost 1.2 million b/d of petroleum product imports in 2023, a 3% increase from the previous year. Asia was the source for 58% of all petroleum product imports.39 Fuel oil (28%) accounted for the largest share of petroleum product imports in 2023, followed by diesel (25%) and gasoline (20%).40 Malaysia also exported 1.3 million b/d of petroleum products in 2023, a 7% increase from the previous year. The Asia Pacific region was the destination for 79% of all petroleum product exports.41 Diesel (24%) accounted for the largest share of exports in 2023, followed by fuel oil (20%) and biodiesel (19%).42 Natural Gas In 2023, Malaysia exported 85 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas to Singapore via pipeline.43 Malaysia’s LNG exports declined 7% from 2022 to 1.3 Tcf in 2023. Although Japan still receives the largest share of Malaysia LNG exports, in 2023, Japan imported approximately 90 Bcf less than in 2022.44 Electricity Malaysia’s electricity exports significantly increased after 2016. The increase was driven by a power trading project established in 2016, between Sarawak Energy Berhad and Indonesia’s state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara. The power is exported through the 275 kV Sarawak-West Kalimatan Interconnection. In October 2021, Malaysia banned the export of renewable energy which may account for some of the decrease in exports in 2021 and 2022. The ban was lifted in May 2023 to attract more development in its renewable sector.45 Coal In 2023, Malaysia’s coal imports increased almost 10% from 2022 to 42 million short tons. Most imports came from the Asia Pacific region (91%). Malaysia increased its imports of Indonesia’s coal to 31 million short ton in 2023, up approximately 3 million short tons from 2022.46 Source: This article was published by EIA Endnotes: U.S. Energy Information Administration, International Energy Statistics; International Gas Union, 2024 World LNG Report, page 24.

More Countries Sign Declaration To Triple Nuclear Capacity	At the COP29 UN climate change conference taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, six more countries - El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kosovo, Nigeria and Turkey - have added their support for the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. During COP28 - held in Dubai, UAE, in December last year - 25 countries backed a Ministerial Declaration calling for the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The heads of state, or senior officials, from Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ghana, Hungary, Jamaica, Japan, South Korea, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, the UAE, the UK and the USA signed the declaration on 2 December, with Armenia and Croatia also signing up during the summit. The declaration says the countries recognise the need for a tripling of nuclear energy capacity to achieve 'global net-zero greenhouse gas/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century and in keeping a 1.5°C limit on temperature rise within reach'. It also recognises that 'new nuclear technologies could occupy a small land footprint and can be sited where needed, partner well with renewable energy sources and have additional flexibilities that support decarbonisation beyond the power sector, including hard-to-abate industrial sectors'. On Wednesday, in an event co-organised by the COP29 Presidency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the USA and World Nuclear Association, a further six countries signed the declaration. This brings the total number of countries endorsing the declaration to triple to 31. Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy said the country's signing of the declaration 'demonstrates its commitment to sustainable development goals and its desire to make a significant contribution to combating climate change. Nuclear energy is considered one of the key components of Kazakhstan's energy balance, which will allow the country to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, increase the share of clean energy sources and ensure reliable energy supply.' 'We warmly welcome these six new countries to the Coalition of the Ambitious,' said World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León. 'Today's announcement highlights the essential role of nuclear energy in meeting the Paris Agreement goals in a cost-effective and equitable manner. 'Leadership requires a clear-eyed assessment of the here and now, but also the foresight to prepare for what the world will need not only in 2050, but in the decades after. The signatories to this declaration are making a long-term commitment. But it is a long-term commitment with a long-term pay off, providing energy certainty and reliability in an uncertain world.' World Nuclear Association noted the announcement 'is the latest moment of recognition for the essential role of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions'. On Tuesday at COP, the US Administration issued a roadmap outlining plans for the deployment of 200 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Other recent developments have included the recognition of nuclear energy - for the first time in a major COP decision - among the solutions needed to keep the 1.5-degree goal within reach, as part of last year's Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. In March, the IAEA and Belgium co-chaired the first Nuclear Energy Summit, in which countries highlighted the role of nuclear energy in reducing the use of fossil fuels, enhancing energy security, and boosting economic development. In September, at New York Climate Week, 14 of the world's largest banks and financial institutions from five countries signalled their support for tripling global nuclear capacity. 'Nuclear can now count on the world's biggest banks to back the growth of the nuclear industry,' Bilbao y León said. 'Nuclear has attracted the interest and investment of the world's largest and most advanced technology companies. And nuclear has ever-increasing support from the public, who recognise that in nuclear they have an answer to their demands for energy security, reliable supply and prices, and a response to climate change. This is truly a global coalition of the ambitious. And thank you all for being part of it.' World Nuclear Association and the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, with support from the IAEA's Atoms4NetZero and the UK government, launched the Net Zero Nuclear initiative in September 2023 seeking 'unprecedented collaboration between government, industry leaders and civil society' ahead of COP28. The Net Zero Nuclear Industry Pledge, has been endorsed by more than 130 companies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRccCom8yuDXlD	2024-11-13T16:06:26-08:00	
What Do We Know About The Mufti Bill 2024? – Analysis	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof and Minderjeet Kaur A bill introduced in Malaysia’s parliament earlier this year to expand the powers of the muftis – Muslim legal experts – in the federal territories (FT) of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya is expected to be tabled for debate and possible passage within a month. Traditionally, muftis are appointed by state rulers in Malaysia, giving religious authorities significant autonomy. Critics argue the bill could expand to the states in Malaysia, potentially infringing on individual freedoms and intellectual diversity. What is the Mufti Bill 2024? The bill outlines the specific duties and powers of the Department of the Mufti for the Federal Territory. It specifies the mufti’s role in advising the King on Islamic affairs, according to Sirajuddin Suhaimee, Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim) director-general. Currently, Muslim fatwas serve as advisory opinions rather than enforceable law except in cases where they become part of the Sharia Law. However, under the bill’s Article 10, the fatwas could become law without needing parliament’s approval once they are published in the Official Gazette. Sirajuddin told BenarNews that no official date has been set, adding the bill is expected to be tabled before the parliament session ends on Dec. 12. Why are some opposed? While proponents argue the bill would improve the consistency of Islamic rulings throughout Malaysia, critics including northern-state Perlis Mufti Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, called it a move toward unchecked religious authority and a threat to intellectual autonomy. One contentious aspect of the bill is its restriction of Islamic interpretations to only four Sunni schools of thought – Shafi’i, Hanbali, Maliki, and Hanafi – which has drawn particular criticism. Non-Sunni interpretations include Shia and Ahmadi views, which are often seen as deviant in Malaysia. Ahmad Farouk Musa, founder of the Islamic Renaissance Front, a progressive Islamic think-tank, argued that the bill enforces a narrow theological stance, leaving no room for alternative streams of thought. 'There will be no more freedom of conscience in this country. All Muslims [in the country] must adhere to this theology of the state,' he told BenarNews. 'I thought that the government celebrates diversity. But in actual fact, we are killing that diversity with the bill.' Meanwhile, Sisters in Islam (SIS), a women’s rights group, warned that legally binding fatwas could result in punishments for actions not criminalized under secular law. 'Fatwas are traditionally advisory, meant to guide Muslims on religious matters – not to be enforced as law,' the group said in a statement. What are implications for states’ rights? The constitution divides religious jurisdiction between federal and state authorities, with the country’s nine sultans overseeing Islamic matters within their states. The federal territories fall under the purview of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Malaysia’s king, who acts as head of Islam in these regions. One constitutional analyst argued the bill does not infringe on states’ rights, as it pertains solely to the federal territories. 'The autonomy of the religious authorities of other states are not affected because they are protected under their respective state constitutions,' Wan Ahmad Fauzi, a constitutional law analyst at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told BenarNews. Does it impact non-Muslims? Although the bill applies only to Muslims, critics argue that an increase in unchecked authority for a religious official could potentially strain interfaith relations. As of mid-2023, Malaysia’s population of 34.2 million was predominantly Muslim (63.5%), with significant Buddhist (18.7%), Christian (9.1%), and Hindu (6.1%) communities. 'The bill’s implications on race relations need careful consideration, given the high percentage of non-Muslims in the FT,' think tank founder Farouk Musa said. Could bill influence political power? Some observers see the bill as a strategy to win over conservative Malay voters who make up over 70% of the population by showing the government’s commitment to the traditional Sunni doctrine, Sunnah Wal Jamaah. 'The government may view passing this bill as a way to gain Malay support, as it reinforces Malaysia’s orthodox Sunni values,' Azmil Mohd Tayeb, a political analyst at Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Analyst Tunku Mohar Mokhtar of the International Islamic University Malaysia had a different take, telling BenarNews the strategy could be seen as overreaching. 'If the bill is designed to gain votes, it may backfire,' he said, pointing out that much of the opposition comes from those aligned with Pakatan Harapan, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s multiethnic coalition. 'It also cannot get votes from [Islamist party] PAS supporters who aren’t into much theological debates.' Is it necessary? Even as government officials defend the bill as an essential update to streamline Islamic governance, many critics remain unconvinced over concerns it risks intensifying bureaucratic control over religious life. 'Yes, we need this bill for better administration of Islamic matters in the federal territories,' analyst Ahmad Fauzi said. In contrast, Farouk Musa sees the bill as 'sectarian and divisive,' adding it is unnecessary and could hinder inclusivity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcbzdeg1qAiu3	2024-11-13T16:04:51-08:00	
Medicare ‘Advantage’ By The Numbers – Analysis	By Emma Curchin, Brandon Novick, and Peter Hart The quasi-privatized system called 'Medicare Advantage,' otherwise known as Part C, was created in 2003 as a means of expanding the role of private sector corporations in the publicly-funded Medicare system. Proponents claimed it would lower costs and improve health care for seniors. It has achieved neither of those goals; instead, MA has become a wildly profitable scheme for private insurance giants, who have become adept at taking advantage of Medicare's billing model to claim exorbitant profits. At this point, MA is more profitable for many companies than their conventional insurance businesses. And the program continues to grow. MA now has more enrollees than traditional Medicare, thanks in no small part to aggressive public relations campaigns that sell seniors on the idea that the plans cut costs and increase choice. Congress has simultaneously failed to plug the holes in traditional Medicare, pushing seniors towards MA to avoid high out-of-pocket costs. Policymakers can fill these gaps and guarantee true comprehensive coverage simply by redirecting the overpayments to MA insurers into Medicare. Numerous studies and media investigations have documented the problems with Medicare Advantage. What follows is a collection of some of the most notable figures documenting the high costs of this failed experiment in privatizing Medicare. $88-$140 billionThe amount that the federal government overpaid private insurers under Medicare Advantage in 2022, according to the Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP). $612 billionThe amount that Medicare Advantage plans overcharged the federal government due to upcoding and favorable selection between 2007 and 2023, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent congressional agency established to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. $600 billionAccording to one study, this is the projected excess spending between 2023 to 2031 due to the ways that Medicare Advantage plans use 'upcoding,' the process of classifying beneficiaries as being sicker than they really are in order to increase payments. $35 billionThe amount that MedPAC estimates taxpayers will overpay MA insurers this year through 'favorable selection,' the practice of targeting healthy seniors for their plans. $4.2 billionThe amount that MA insurers received for questionable home visit health risk assessments (and related chart reviews) in 2023, according to an October 2024 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. 80 percentThe percentage of mental health providers in a sample of MA plans that were determined to be 'ghosts' (meaning they were unreachable, not accepting new patients, or not in-network), according to a recent Senate investigation. 1.8 millionEstimated number of Medicare Advantage customers whose health plans will be canceled in 2025. 167 percentThe amount that drug deductibles will increase for roughly two-thirds of all Medicare Advantage enrollees next year. 55.7 percentThe increase in MA care denials from 2022 to 2023, according to research from the American Hospital Association. 54 percentThe increase in the denial rate for long-term acute care hospitals in Humana's Medicare Advantage plans from 2020 to 2022 (Senate Majority Staff Report, 10/17/24). $660 millionThe amount of taxpayer money that CVS/Aetna stashed away in 2018 by denying Medicare Advantage patients' claims for treatment at inpatient facilities (Senate Majority Staff Report). 78 percentThe percentage of physicians in a 2023 American Medical Association survey who said that Medicare Advantage's prior authorization processes caused a recommended treatment for a patient to be abandoned. $6 billionOne estimate of the amount spent in 2022 on the marketing companies that work to attract new subscribers in Medicare Advantage plans. 556,068The number of English-language TV commercials touting Medicare Advantage that aired during the seven-week open enrollment period in 2022. $50 billionThe amount that the Wall Street Journal estimates private insurers received between 2018 and 2021 for 'hundreds of thousands of questionable diagnoses that triggered extra taxpayer-funded payments.' $2,329The amount that MA insurers receive per beneficiary above the estimated costs of Medicare. $1,730The gross profit margin posted by MA companies in 2021 – more than double their profit margin on the individual market. $172 millionThe amount that Cigna agreed to pay in 2023 to 'resolve allegations that it knowingly submitted and failed to withdraw inaccurate and untruthful diagnosis codes for its Medicare Advantage Plan enrollees to increase its payments from Medicare.' The Justice Department continues to investigate similar allegations involving other MA providers.

Conflict In Amhara Region Threatens To Ignite Another Ethiopian W...	Gun battles in late October shattered the typical tranquility of Debark town, nestled in the foothills of the Semien mountains in Ethiopia’s Amhara region. Months of intense fighting in Ethiopia’s second-largest region have dislodged any sense of peace in the war-torn country, as the federal government struggles with what potentially could be another civil war. While the Pretoria Agreement was intended to end Ethiopia’s conflict in the Tigray region in November 2022, it left unresolved many issues such as decades-old territorial disputes between Amhara and Tigrayan people. 'The peace deal two years ago was supposed to ensure that Ethiopia’s warring parties could mend such rifts through further negotiations rather than violence. But no such talks have materialized,' The Economist magazine wrote in an October 27 article. 'For now, it is no more than a ceasefire — and one that could easily collapse.' After fighting alongside federal forces against the Tigrayans, ethnic Amhara militias known as Fano were told in April 2023 to disarm and integrate with the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF). Rather than comply, Fano unleashed an insurgency by seizing towns and roadways. In late September 2024, federal forces launched an offensive against Fano, ominously declaring it the 'final operation.' The ENDF attacked the militias and briefly entered several towns, including Gondar and Metema. Fighting has escalated since the end of the rainy season, as drier conditions have allowed troops to move more easily, and clearer skies make way for military drones. There were 43 drone attacks and airstrikes in 22 districts across the Amhara region between September 25 and October 24, killing 196 including civilians and injuring 77, according to the Amhara Association of America. The ENDF reportedly has poured tens of thousands of troops into the Amhara region. 'Over the past two weeks, there have been numerous reinforcements (of the federal army) and many arrests of officials suspected of collusion with the Fano,' a security source told Agence France-Presse on the condition of anonymity in early October. While the ENDF has wrestled back control of several towns, it continues to face a resilient foe that enjoys popular support from the Amhara. Fano is less an organized group than it is a fragmented coalition of autonomous militias. The ENDF’s gains have forced Fano fighters to retreat into the mountains and wage guerilla warfare. 'Fano’s decentralized structure makes it hard for it to leverage its strength into political power,' analyst Liam Carr concluded in a September intelligence assessment for the Critical Threats Project. 'A strengthened Fano insurgency increases the risk of ethnic conflict with neighboring regions in Ethiopia, such as Tigray and Oromia, and would affect transnational issues involving Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan that could further destabilize Ethiopia or other areas in the Horn of Africa.' A contingent of the ENDF on October 26 met with members of the Debark community to discuss a path to sustainable peace. The military’s representative, however, blamed Fano for the violence. 'The extremist group that is full of hatred and blind thinking, has brought the people into conflict, robbed their own people and put government development institutions in danger,' Maj. Gen. Amare Gebru, head of Debark command post, said during the gathering, according to the ENDF. Peace talks are unlikely and neither side appears capable of a military victory, according to Adem Abebe, senior advisor on peacebuilding for the Sweden-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. 'The Fano are not ready for peace negotiations,' he told The Africa Report for an October 10 article. 'The government may try and talk to some leaders here and there, but until there is some coordination among Fano, it is going to be very difficult for any individual Fano leader to commit to a peace process publicly. 'I don’t think much will change on the battlefield, but the situation will continue bringing terrible suffering for the people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcTcODhEWHFgj	2024-11-13T15:58:42-08:00	
Liberal Arrogance And Hatred On Display After Trump Victory – OpE...	While Donald Trump is frequently called a fascist and is even compared to Adolph Hitler, some angry democrats are engaging in their own racist and eliminationist rhetoric in the wake of his impending return to the presidency. Their reaction to Trump’s victory reveals that intolerance and bigotry are not unique to Trump and his followers. 'F*** ‘em. I hope they are all deported. And I can’t wait until Netanyahu gets the green light to turn Gaza into a parking lot.' 'Can’t wait for the next Muslim ban. F*** them. They get the president they deserve.' 'I hope every woman who voted for Trump and lives in a no abortion state gets what they wanted. To bleed out in a parking lot due to a miscarriage and no doctor will help you because THAT’S what you voted for. Y’all deserve it.''To the black men in Georgia that voted for Trump next time a cop has their knee on yall necks PLEASE LEAVE US BLACK WOMEN OUT OF IT!' 'Good morning to all my Arab Americans, dearborn Michigan, Palestinian supporters and Gaza pearl clutchers! Black Americans, Black Women & Black Men are done! We won’t donate to your causes or feel sorry about any bombings! We had your back but you turned your back on us!' These are just a few of the missives that angry democrats posted on social media after Kamala Harris was defeated in her campaign against Donald Trump. While every Trump utterance is examined for proof of racism and other forms of bigotry, liberals suddenly became very illiberal after the campaign ended. Many of them literally wished death upon Black men, Latino men, Arabs and anyone they hold responsible for Trump’s return to the white house. The white people who still form the base of his support are somehow exempt from these attacks. While disturbing, these behaviors are not entirely unexpected. Instead of telling their voters how a Harris administration would benefit their lives, her campaign engaged in a propaganda effort, amplifying former Trump officials to attest to his fascist beliefs or resuscitating old stories about his alleged affinity for Hitler and Nazi ideology . If Trump and his supporters are in fact comparable to Nazis then no scorn or condemnation of them is too harsh. But these opinions did not indicate any level of political maturity or analysis. The tit for tat expressions which wished suffering upon others are akin to the worst sloganeering of the MAGA hat wearing Trump followers who are so despised, the 'deplorables' as it were. The people who think of themselves as being more enlightened actually took the time to consider and publicly share their violent sentiments as they wished bombings on civilians or death from abortion bans. Much of the blame falls on the Democratic Party itself which, absent any intention of legislating programs that would help their voters prosper in their material lives, has instead chosen to stoke hatred against republicans. Emotions are substitutes for policy, as the administration which billed itself as the 'most progressive since FDR' allowed covid era stimulus payments, expansions of unemployment insurance, freezes on student loan payments, eviction protection, and SNAP and Medicaid benefits to lapse. There was no action on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act or on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act which would restore enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act. The federal minimum wage didn’t go up and, as Joe Biden promised, Medicare for All was never on the agenda. In the absence of tangible policies to run on, they had nothing but a bipartisan vote to make Juneteenth a national holiday and then tapped into fear mongering against republicans. The end result is not only anger and sadness that Trump will again be president but also a kind of mass psychosis that endlessly repeats that he is a liar who received five draft deferments for bone spurs while never mentioning that Biden also received five draft deferments as a student and a medical exemption for asthma. Trump’s lies are endlessly dissected but not Biden’s campaign promise that he would not permit oil drilling on federal land but did just that in 2023 when he approved the Willow Project in Alaska. Black democrats are particularly confused. Every four years they are barraged with appeals to vote for the 'Black party' and send the republicans, the 'white party' down to defeat. The Republican Party has received the majority of votes from white people in presidential elections since 1964. It is the home of open and unfettered white racist sentiment and action, so the feelings of doom are understandable. But the duopoly trap creates political passivity, encouraging voter participation only in presidential election years while giving a myriad of reasons for telling Black people not to demand anything other than a democrat sitting behind the big desk in the oval office while promising little else in return. In such a system, everyone becomes an enemy. If a democratic presidency is the one and only prize, then every issue that argues against support must be ignored or opposed and anyone raising issues such as the US-funded genocide in Gaza is also an enemy. Palestinians who refuse to support the genocidal Democratic Party which is killing their people are now called the enemies of Black people. Latino support for the democrats falls every election cycle but still, a majority of voters in that group voted for Harris, approximately 53% . No matter. If the media say that Latino men are voting for Trump then liberals conclude they must all be punished by the deportations they claimed to oppose before the election. Of course, only citizens can vote and by definition cannot be deported. The anger defies logic. It is noteworthy that there is a great deal of punching down, but very little punching up. The Democratic Party clearly failed its voters after raising more than $1 billion and still losing to the man they spent so many years vilifying as a liar, buffoon, criminal, and evil incarnate. The not-so-enlightened liberals rarely even questioned how the debacle came about, much less showed anger at the candidate, or the party, or the process by which an unpopular and frail president face planted in a debate before being taken out of the election by rich donors, and replaced by a Vice President without a vote – a Vice President who did not even earn one delegate in earlier primary elections. Liberals also did not challenge the questionable strategy of chasing a handful of 'never Trump' republican votes and spending millions of dollars on concerts with celebrities. One would think that the mental energy needed to conjure up a destroyed Gaza might also manage to ask hard questions of the woman at the top of the ticket. Apparently, Trump is not the only authoritarian in U.S. politics. Democratic voters also believe in a hierarchy that tells them to act like children abused by an unstable parent who demands their silence. Politics is now about feeling superior to others rather than being able to cogently argue against them or defend one’s own position. It is not about asking their betters anything, including why they lost. It seems that the U.S. is full of mean and angry people. Of course, their own government engages in austerity meant to grind them down economically and to deprive them of any political recourse. But the people don’t have to accept this treatment. They don’t have to become the angry mob. The truth is that people in this country have been dehumanized to the point where they lack empathy for others. They also have been kept uninformed and ignorant. Even the liberal professional class, which holds itself up as the best among the population, is just as indoctrinated as thousands of Trumpers on January 6th. Its members do not know how to activate themselves politically, how to struggle with like minded people, or how to make political demands. Seeing oneself as the good group is thought to be enough. Or perhaps these enraged liberals know what they are up against. Despite the celebrity endorsements and happy talk, maybe they know that their party is controlled by an oligarchy that will fight them tooth and nail. They only feel safe spewing vitriol on social media.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcYs8972QQGta	2024-11-13T15:55:53-08:00	
Stunning Defeat Should Prompt Soul-Searching Among Democrats – Op...	By Alon Ben-Meir The Democrats’ stunning electoral defeat will be debated for months if not years. Recrimination and finger-pointing will abound. The Democrats must search their souls, carefully study what went wrong, and develop a compelling new domestic and foreign policy agenda while cooperating with the Republicans on any issue that advances America’s well-being and global leadership Trump won the 2024 election fair and square. Certainly, the economy and immigration played a significant role, aided by gains among younger Black and Hispanic voters as well as inroads in traditionally Democratic urban and suburban areas in the swing states. And Trump’s uncanny skill in portraying himself as the victim of the leftist elite became the mantra of his MAGA followers and the whole Republican party. However, instead of emphasizing the bread-and-butter issues from which the public at large is suffering, the Democrats’ obsession with Trump and their depiction of him as the greatest menace to democracy, an authoritarian who is unfit to serve, did not resonate with the majority of the public. But regardless of the reasons behind the Democratic party’s defeat, what should matter is how the party moves forward, reorients itself, and is responsive to the disenchanted public looking for change. Reflect, Not Recriminate The Democrats need to prioritize self-examination and rebuilding rather than blame. As one Democratic operative stated, 'It’s not a pointing fingers day. It’s a reflection day.' This approach allows the party to constructively analyze its shortcomings and develop strategies for future success. Recrimination distracts from addressing the fundamental problems that led to the defeat. The party needs to focus on reconnecting with working-class voters and addressing economic concerns that resonate with the electorate. Internal finger-pointing could exacerbate existing divisions within the party. Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-IL) noted, 'Finger-pointing is not worth it at all. This was a message. The voters were speaking to us. It would be to our detriment to not hear it.' Continued attacks on Trump may backfire. Multiple impeachments and legal proceedings against Trump made him appear as a victim, energizing his base. Excessive recrimination could further damage the party’s credibility with voters who felt disconnected from Democratic messaging. Focusing on recrimination could prevent the necessary 'comprehensive reassessment' called for by many Democrats. By avoiding recrimination and concentrating on constructive analysis and forward-thinking strategies, the Democratic Party can better position itself to address voters’ concerns and rebuild its coalition for future electoral success. The Democrats Need Soul-Searching The Democrats should engage in soul-searching and introspection and reflect on several critical points. Many Democrats believe the party lost touch with working-class voters, including Latino and Black workers. There’s a call to refocus on economic issues and address the everyday concerns of voters rather than primarily focusing on Trump’s character or threats to democracy. There are calls for fresh leadership and new strategies. Harris’s campaign focused too much on moderate Republicans at the expense of the party’s working-class base, and its warnings about Trump’s threat to democracy as a campaign strategy were not effective. Analyzing why Trump gained ground with younger voters, African Americans, and Hispanics, and examining the party’s weakening relationship with working-class voters across racial lines, are needed. Debating the party’s stance on critical issues like immigration, calling to address economic concerns, and reflecting on whether the Democratic Party has become too associated with elites and lost its connection to working-class Americans is necessary. Additionally, it is critical to increase diversity among party decision-makers and reassess the party’s infrastructure and fundraising methods. There should also be a discussion on how to work with Trump’s administration. Finally, the party must craft more effective messaging strategies and communication with the electorates for future elections, which was missing. Developing a Positive Agenda The Democrats must focus on crafting a compelling vision for the future rather than dwelling on past grievances. As Filippo Trevisan, Associate Professor of Public Communication at American University stated, 'You can’t just be a ‘No’-party, you need to come up with proposals.' With midterms in 2026 and the presidential election in 2028, the party needs to focus on developing new strategies and cultivating new leadership. The defeat highlighted deeper problems within the party structure and strategy. It’s important to note that there’s significant debate about the best path forward. Some argue for a more populist economic approach, while others caution against abandoning the party’s current coalition. Additionally, the effectiveness of policy-based appeals versus cultural messaging is fiercely contested. Others suggest that Democrats need to focus on enacting policies that produce clear, immediate benefits for working families. In that vein, there are several vital points to consider regarding how Democrats could potentially reconnect with this crucial demographic: Refocus on economic issues Many analysts argue that Democrats ought to prioritize kitchen-table economic concerns that directly impact working families’ lives. This includes addressing issues like wage stagnation, job security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living. Incremental changes are not enough; the Democrats must propose bold, ambitious economic and political reforms to convince voters that they can deliver real change. Improving messaging and communication: Even when Democrats have enacted pro-worker policies, they’ve sometimes struggled to effectively convey the benefits to voters. There’s a need to better articulate and communicate how Democratic initiatives tangibly improve working people’s lives. Recruiting more working-class candidates: Fielding candidates who personally understand the challenges faced by working-class communities could help Democrats rebuild trust and credibility with these voters. Furthermore, Democrats must find ways to bridge the growing cultural gap between the party’s leadership and working-class voters, particularly on social issues. Focusing on corporate accountability Challenging corporate power and economic inequality could resonate with workers who feel the system is rigged against them. At the same time, strengthening ties with unions and the labor movement could help Democrats reconnect with their working-class roots. Addressing regional economic disparities Democrats must dive deeper into economic issues and pay more attention to the economic challenges facing working-class communities in areas that have experienced industrial decline or economic stagnation. They must rethink trade and globalization while developing a more worker-focused approach to trade policy and addressing the negative impacts of globalization on specific communities. Ultimately, rebuilding trust with working-class voters will likely require a multi-layered approach that combines policy initiatives, effective communication, and a demonstrated commitment to addressing the economic and social challenges facing these communities. Cooperating with the New Trump Administration In the current political atmosphere, the Democratic Party should cooperate with the new Trump administration while positioning itself as constructive rather than obstructive. America is stuck with Trump for the next four years, and instead of opposing every move he makes, they should find a way to cooperate, especially where it is in the national interest to do so and use cooperation to mitigate the harm that may otherwise result from his actions. Domestic policy Even in a polarized environment, Democrats could offer alternative solutions rather than simply opposing Trump’s policies. While methods may differ, both parties often share common objectives like improving the economy, enhancing national security, addressing healthcare costs, reforming immigration, and securing borders. Additionally, some policy areas still have bipartisan support, which the Democrats could prioritize, including cybersecurity, improving national defense capabilities, specific economic policies aimed at supporting working-class Americans, infrastructure development, and reforming government processes and ethics rules. The renewable energy industry is another path for cooperation, as the Republicans will continue clean energy projects already in place, and see that as a path for job creation and economic growth as these industries advance. Democrats should be willing to engage in constructive discussions and negotiations, even on contentious issues, to demonstrate their commitment to finding common ground. To be sure, the Democrats could frame their collaboration regarding these shared goals by voting for legislation that benefits the country, even if proposed by Republicans, to show their commitment to governance over partisanship. Foreign policy Foreign policy is an area where there’s often more bipartisan consensus. Democrats could support efforts to counter China’s influence while advocating for a balanced approach. They could also work on strengthening alliances and international partnerships and collaborate on addressing global challenges like climate change while framing it in terms of economics and job creation. In addition, both sides could find common ground to end the war in Ukraine and Gaza and establish a path that would lead to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, which both Republican and Democratic administrations have been advocating for decades. By taking these approaches in domestic and foreign policy, the Democratic Party could cooperate on many critical issues while maintaining its fundamental values and positioning itself anew as a constructive force in American politics. This strategy could help bridge some of the partisan divide and potentially lead to more effective governance. The Democratic Party needs to heal itself while also healing a dangerously polarized nation by building bridges rather than deepening the divide and, in so doing, rising and answering the call of the American people, who deserve and expect better governance.

A Year After Offensive, Rebels Control Most Of Myanmar’s Rakhine ...	One year after renewed fighting in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, the rebel Arakan Army controls some 80 percent of the state while the military junta’s airstrikes and its blockade of trade routes have left residents worried about their safety and food shortages. The ethnic Arakan Army, or AA, began its offensive on Nov. 13, 2023, and has since captured 10 out of the state’s 17 townships, as well as one township in neighboring Chin state. The group is battling for self-determination for the mostly Buddhist Rakhine people. It would be the first Myanmar rebel group to take over a state if it seizes – as it has vowed to do – all territory under military control in Rakhine state. Myanmar’s military, which took control of the country in a 2021 coup, has been battling various rebel armies and militias across the country, and has faced some of its biggest setbacks in Rakhine. The AA’s battlefield successes over the last year has been unprecedented since the fall of the Arakan Kingdom to the Burmese in 1784, according to Pe Than, a former member of parliament from Rakhine state. 'Our Arakan people lost our sovereignty about 240 years ago,' he told Radio Free Asia. 'Throughout this period, the successive generations in Rakhine have engaged in revolutionary efforts, yet we did not achieve victory. 'Now, during the era of the AA, we have found success,' he said. 'It is believed that the national dignity of the Rakhine people can be restored along with that of the AA, as it has been a great achievement.' The AA has repeatedly vowed to capture Sittwe, the state capital and one of the last important military holdings in Rakhine. Last month, AA fighters advanced on the junta’s Western Command headquarters in Ann township, about 120 km (75 miles) southwest of Sittwe. Additionally, there have been heated battles for control of Maungdaw township near the Bangladesh border since July. Junta air attacks In the townships where it has won control, the AA and its political wing, the United League of Arakan, have been operating civilian administration, judicial and development sectors, AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha said during an online news conference on June 8. 'We will diligently follow our roadmap to build a society prevailed with justice, peace and human dignity for the Arakan people,' he said. 'We are also committed to establishing a future that guarantees equality and rights for all communities residing in Arakan state.' But the threat of junta airstrikes remains a significant concern for locals, and many towns and homes have yet to be rebuilt because of financial constraints and difficulties obtaining supplies, he said. Additionally, the fighting has severely hindered children’s ability to get an education, he said. The junta had already closed many of Rakhine state’s schools, and in some areas children aren’t allowed to walk to school that remain open because of the threat of air strikes, which often target civilian buildings. 'Parents are hiring private teachers for their children,' Khaing Thu Kha said. 'It has been a form of self-reliant education.' Junta air attacks and artillery targeted at Rakhine state’s civilian populations have left 486 people dead and 1,043 injured over the last year, according to the records of the AA and the statements from residents. 'Over the past year, the military junta has carried out excessive airstrikes, destroying religious buildings, hospitals, clinics, residential areas, villages and refugee camps,' said Wai Hin Aung, a volunteer helping war displaced persons in Rakhine. Rakhine civil society organizations have estimated that more than 600,000 people have been forced to flee their homes due to the fierce fighting between the junta and the AA. RFA was unable to reach junta spokesperson Major Gen. Zaw Min Tun on Wednesday to ask about the current situation in Rakhine state. Refugees eye return Across the border in Bangladesh, where some 1 million stateless Rohingya refugees live in tightly packed border camps – including more than 50,000 who have fled the fighting in Rakhine this year – there is some hope that refugees can return once the AA gains full control of Rakhine. 'The AA has a visionary approach, and I believe their governance would not mirror the harsh policies of the military council,' one refugee who has been living in Bangladesh since 2017 told RFA. 'If the AA succeeds in capturing Maungdaw and gains international recognition, I believe they would engage in dialogue with the Rohingya,' he said. Another refugee who identified himself as Kairo thought that international recognition of the AA as a legitimate government was unlikely. 'I believe our chance of returning to Rakhine state will be very slim if the AA takes control now,' Kairo said. 'I don’t think UNHCR will hand us over to an unrecognized organization,' referring to the U.N refugee agency. 'Even if they gain control of 17 townships, it could take at least two to three years for them to achieve international recognition.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcVykU-QRFq_o	2024-11-13T15:50:47-08:00	
Robert Reich: What Will You Do? – OpEd	Many of you are still in shock about what happened a week ago today. Some of you don’t even want to read a newspaper or hear the news. I get it. A few of you are coping with the catastrophe by minimizing or denying it. Several friends assure me that a second Trump term won’t be much different from the first and that the checks and balances in our system will continue to constrain him. This is wishful and dangerous thinking. Trump and his Republican lapdogs will almost certainly win the House, which means that starting January 20, they will take full control of the federal government — both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency. The Republicans soon to be in control of Congress are more MAGA, less principled, and more intimidated by Trump than the Republicans who had control when Trump took office in 2017. There are no Liz Cheneys in the House, no Mitt Romneys in the Senate. Republican senators seeking to become the majority leader are already competing to please Trump, promising immediate confirmation of his appointments. The Republican Party as a whole has now been effectively purged of people willing to stand up to Trump. Trump already has effective control of the Supreme Court, a majority of whom have ruled that he (or any president) is presumptively immune from criminal liability for whatever he chooses to do. This time, moreover, there won’t be people in the administration to stop him. Trump learned from his first term about the importance of surrounding himself with lackeys who will do whatever he wishes. His early picks (Susie Wiles as chief of staff, Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff, Thomas Homan as border czar, Lee Zeldin as EPA administrator, Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the U.N., and Michael Walz as national security advisor) have only one thing in common and it’s not their expertise. It’s their unblinking loyalty to Trump. Don’t get me started about Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, who has turned his X platform into a swamp of Trump lies and propaganda, and now seems joined at the hip to Trump — appearing wherever Trump is. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a nut job. And unlike Trump’s first term, the president-elect is now backed by a network of dangerous extremists — including those who have been imprisoned for their part in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, whom Trump has suggested he’ll pardon. They will feel emboldened to carry out what they understand to be Trump’s wishes. Finally, also unlike before his first term, Trump has explicitly told us what he plans to do and already has people working on getting it done starting January 20: mass deportations, prosecution of his political enemies, the use of the military against U.S. citizens, the purging of the civil service across the government and substitution of Trump loyalists, and a promise to play politics with disasters. Project 2025, which was written by more than 140 people who served under Trump the first time around, including several of his former Cabinet secretaries, explicitly calls for 'abortion surveillance' and the stripping from Americans of reproductive freedom (page 455). It also calls for jailing teachers and librarians over banned books (page 5), gutting of overtime pay rules (pages 587 and 592), and prioritizing 'married men and women' over other types of families (page 489). To enforce these attacks on our rights, Project 2025 would use the Justice Department to prosecute district attorneys Trump disagrees with, invoke the Insurrection Act to shut down protests, and mobilize red-state national guard units against blue states that resist his authoritarian agenda. In sum, my friends, we are facing a catastrophe far worse than what occurred in Trump’s first term of office. The meager guardrails that existed then will be gone. We must not avert our eyes from this calamity, or minimize it, or throw up our hands in despair or retreat. We must prepare to fight it. But how? Let me ask you: If this were Germany in 1933, what actions would you take? How different will this be from Germany in 1933? I put this question to some of you last Wednesday during my weekly Office Hours. Forty percent said your most important goal will be to protect those in harm’s way, and 34 percent said it will be to organize and mobilize politically. Of the remainder, 9 percent said it will be to resist with civil disobedience. (Others had additional or different ideas.) Obviously, none of these alternatives is exclusive. We must consider all, and many others. Protecting the vulnerable and preserving our rights and liberties will require a great deal of hard work by people who believe in our Constitution, democracy, and the rule of law. The work includes: Monitoring Trump and his government — despite the disinformation, propaganda, and lies we’ll be receiving — and disseminating the truth. Maintaining a watch over the people and institutions we value. Being ready to sound the alarm in our communities and networks when those people and institutions are under assault. Organizing and mobilizing nonviolent resistance to such assaults. Using civil disobedience wherever possible. Litigating through state and federal courts where possible. Speaking out against malicious lies like those that spread during the election by Elon Musk on his propaganda machine X and against vicious lies amplified on other MAGA mouthpieces. Using our economic muscle to boycott corporations that support Trump, Musk, and other centers of MAGA power. And much more. It will be up to us — the American people who still cherish democracy — to protect and preserve our system of self-government. As difficult as it is to fully accept what we are up against, the first step is to acknowledge it.

Arab Americans Have A Second Chance To Influence Trump – OpEd	After Donald Trump was sworn in as America’s 45th president in 2017, the Arab American community made the mistake of joining the Democrats’ attacks on him, refusing to meet him or engage with him on policies. This was despite the fact that one of Trump’s closest business friends on his hit TV shows 'The Apprentice' and 'The Celebrity Apprentice' was a Palestinian, Farouk Shami. Many Arab Americans incredulously expected Trump to do what their own Democratic allies refused to do: undermine the extremist government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and elevate the interests of Palestinian rights. Instead of engaging with Trump, they joined in the personal attacks and confrontation orchestrated by Democrats, including defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was responsible for many failures in the Middle East when she was secretary of state. One of the consequences was that Palestinians boycotted the 2019 'Peace to Prosperity' conference organized in Bahrain by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew with strong ties to Israel. With no Palestinians present to push back, the conference strengthened the agenda of Israel and Netanyahu with Trump and the White House. As a result, Trump pursued policies that gave a clear signal of marginalizing Palestinian needs. Eight years later, Trump today not only has an Orthodox Jewish son-in-law who has his ear, but also an Arab American son-in-law, Michael Boulos, the husband of Tiffany Trump, and his influential father, Dr. Massad Boulos, who both also have the new president-elect’s ear. More importantly, Trump and pro-Arab Jewish American candidate Jill Stein took a great deal of Arab American votes away from Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. For example, in Dearborn, Michigan, which has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country, Trump won nearly 42 percent of the vote, beating Harris’ 40 percent, with Stein third with 15 percent. Arab Americans are on a precipice. They can again turn away from Trump, angered by his statements of support for Israel, or they can engage with him and attempt to influence his policies. Politics is a game of diplomacy and competition, much like a football match. Arab Americans can either be on the field and compete with Israel, or they can walk off the field in protest and leave the entire diplomatic arena to Israel’s control. They do not have the luxury of taking umbrage or showing their anger at Trump’s past and the current Israeli genocide in Gaza and violence in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Lebanon. They need to set aside their personal feelings and emotions, step up to the political plate and play ball. That is their responsibility. Politics may be like a football game that two sides are striving to win, but Arab Americans do not have to win. All they have to do is turn up and play to minimize what Trump will do in the Middle East if the only people speaking to him are Israelis. There is a great imbalance in America when it comes to the truth on Middle East issues, mainly because Israel has dominated the playing field for more than 75 years. They are better at media manipulation and spin, as we saw with the distorted coverage of last week’s violence in Amsterdam, in which Israeli football fans went on the rampage and clashed with locals. However, the media described the incidents as 'antisemitic' and highlighted claims of a new 'pogrom' against Jews in Europe. Despite the spin, and their support for Trump, Arab Americans were not the factor that gave Trump his election victory. Although they played an important role, Trump won because he was able to cut into the Democratic base at every level, including among Hispanics and African Americans. Trump succeeded in not only winning the Electoral College, which determines who becomes president, but he is also poised to win the popular vote. Arab Americans need to recognize the political reality and adapt to it. They need to set aside their emotions, no matter how grievous the pain coming from Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Lebanon, and engage Trump fully and strategically. They have often been reduced to playing the victim card, attempting to push back against political and media bias and the false narratives spun by Israel’s public relations mastery. However, it is easier to be the victim and be angry than to work hard to change the dynamics of the forces driving that suffering. To change that dynamic, Arab Americans need to be better not just at organizing among themselves, but also at engaging the mainstream news media using professional public relations and communications strategies rather than street protests or angry confrontations. Can Arab Americans set aside the pain of Gaza, Lebanon and historic discrimination in America to replace their emotions with a strategic plan to change America’s foreign policy the right way? We have yet to see that happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcWSGgqUU2Ifs	2024-11-13T15:48:27-08:00	
Trump’s Influence Looms Large Over The World – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro As the world digests the result of last week’s momentous US presidential election and prepares itself for a Trump 2.0 presidency, it is not difficult to imagine how the world might look according to the new president. The Palestinians could lose Gaza for good and possibly the West Bank too, as settlers exacerbate the plight of the Palestinians unhindered and unsanctioned by the new US administration, while Lebanon’s destruction continues, with the country teetering on the brink of implosion. Ukraine’s fate will be to prepare to capitulate, according to a peace plan hastily drafted in Washington but guided by the Kremlin. The prospect of electing a Black woman maybe did not cut it for the heavily polarized Americans, despite Kamala Harris’ offer of hope and message of a sunnier future, preferring instead a twice-impeached convicted felon. Maybe this was due to an innate prejudice against women, the travails of dark forces, foreign interference or the tech realm and its manipulation of public opinion. Trump in power, I am led to believe, is likely to magnify and further inflame the stark divide between two Americas. On top of this, he will have full control of Congress, a blank check from the Supreme Court and a renewed faith in his supremacy and in his ability to pander to his supporters’ most basic instincts and prejudices. His first victim is likely to be Ukraine, despite President Volodymyr Zelensky rushing to send his carefully crafted best wishes, in which he praised the president-elect for his 'peace through strength' approach. This is despite knowing all too well that Ukraine is likely to be left in the cold, before the Trump administration forces on Kyiv a peace plan tabled by Washington but penned in the Kremlin that will be just short of total capitulation. Biden and his Western allies’ support for Ukraine initially stemmed from the need to defend the post-Second World War order, but Trump has disregarded that all along, expressing unhidden admiration for President Vladimir Putin and having a long-held belief that 'Ukraine must be part of Russia,' according to one former aide. During his campaign, he often boasted how he could end the Ukraine war 'in a day' and blamed Zelensky for the conflict. Here, I do not need to remind everyone how, over the past two years, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has spared no efforts to vote down and interrupt crucial US government deliveries of weapons and aid to Ukraine. As for the Palestinian question, Arab and Muslim Americans were maybe right to mobilize against the Democrats over the Biden-Harris administration’s inability to find a way to preserve Palestinian lives in Gaza and to hold it responsible for the continued Israeli onslaught. But through backing Trump, the best friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they have helped sow the seeds of a potential total loss of any faint hope for a just solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Netanyahu, who many believe has blocked all efforts that could have led to a cessation of the violence in Gaza over the past few months, was maybe part of a strategy to embarrass the Biden administration and expose its international weakness. Netanyahu, who sacked his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant while the counting of votes was underway in the US, has shifted his war Cabinet further right, expecting the new president to free him from any restraints. And he continues his scorched-earth policies in Gaza and elsewhere that could send the Palestinians further into despair and the political wilderness for at least the next generation or two. Lebanon is unlikely to fare any better, despite Trump’s so-called promises to end the war between Hezbollah and Israel. Trump’s old rhetoric about his previous record of squeezing Iran with sanctions, while deterring war, is set to be tested, as Tehran claims that it is readying another list of Israeli targets to strike after Tel Aviv’s attack on its air defenses and missile plants last month. Trump’s reelection was the result of a complex web of dark forces and the culmination of events that were built on exploiting fears. He has convinced people that his power will earn them salvation, meaning they endorsed his unique approach that could hurt democracy gradually or even sooner come Jan. 20, 2025.

Blinken: Israel Has Met Its Goals In Gaza, Time To End The War	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel has achieved its objectives in Gaza and that it is now time to pursue an end to the ongoing war. Blinken said that ending the conflict would be the most effective means of addressing the urgent needs of Gaza’s civilian population. He called for 'real and extended pauses' in fighting to allow essential humanitarian aid to reach those affected by the hostilities and said that Israel holds an ongoing responsibility to facilitate this assistance, urging sustained efforts to address Gaza’s humanitarian crisis. Blinken also called for increased international pressure on Hamas, seeking 'genuine, sustained, and effective pressure' to cease hostilities. He said that achieving peace requires cooperation from all parties involved, with humanitarian access as a central priority.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcai6pnQp13G1	2024-11-13T15:41:29-08:00	
FBI Arrests Alleged Leaker Of US Intelligence Related To Israel’s...	The U.S. Justice Department has charged a man for allegedly leaking highly classified U.S. intelligence about Israel's plans for retaliation against Iran, according to U.S. media reports on November 13. The reports said that Asif W. Rahman was indicted earlier this month for willfully transmitting national defense information. He was arrested on November 12 in Cambodia by the FBI and was to appear in court in Guam. Court documents indicate that he was employed by the U.S. government. According to a person familiar with his employment, he was employed by the CIA. This employment gave him a top-secret security clearance and allowed him to access sensitive information. The New York Times, which first reported the story, said that Rahman was indicted on a charge related to the posting of the intelligence on Telegram in mid-October. The documents posted included Israeli plans for moving munitions and Israeli Air Force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcci6QlmHplcK	2024-11-13T15:39:21-08:00	
Biden, Trump Pledge Peaceful Transfer Of Power In January	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned triumphantly to Washington on Wednesday, pledging a smooth transition of power in January as he met for two hours at the White House with his longtime political rival, President Joe Biden. 'It was a substantive meeting,' White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'They discussed important national security and domestic policy issues facing the nation and the world.' Biden invited Trump for the traditional visit — a show of the coming Jan. 20 peaceful transfer of power in American democracy between the current U.S. leader and the incoming chief executive. It was Trump’s first visit to the White House since his first presidential term ended in January 2021. The two men sat in front of a roaring fireplace in the Oval Office ahead of their private talks and traded niceties in a peaceful tableau. 'I'm looking forward to having a smooth transition and we're looking forward to talking about some of that today,' Biden said. 'Thank you very much,' Trump replied. 'Politics is tough and in many cases it's not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I appreciate very much a transition so smooth — it will be as smooth as it can get — and I very much appreciate that, Joe. Thank you.' 'You're welcome,' Biden responded. First lady Jill Biden joined her husband in greeting the president-elect upon his arrival at the White House. The White House said she gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania, and expressed her team’s readiness to assist with the transition. The former first lady, who lived in the White House from 2017 to 2021 during her husband’s first presidency, did not accompany him to Washington and has not indicated whether she plans to move into the White House again when he takes office. Biden, a Democrat, had sought to defeat Trump, a Republican, for a second time in the Nov. 5 election, but ended his campaign in July after faltering badly in a debate against Trump. Biden quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him, but Trump swept through seven political battleground states in the election and easily defeated her. When Biden defeated Trump in 2020, Trump offered no White House invitation to meet him ahead of the inauguration and left Washington two hours before Biden’s swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Trump, who to this day claims falsely that he was cheated out of winning the 2020 election by vote fraud, was the first president to not witness his successor’s inauguration since Andrew Johnson skipped the swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. Biden has said he plans to attend Trump’s inauguration. Trump also met with Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber in the current Congress and are nearing a slight majority control in the Congress set to be sworn in Jan. 3, but the outcome of more than a dozen House elections remains uncertain. Trump has moved quickly to fill his nascent administration with Republican officials who have been the most politically loyal to him in the four years he has been out of office. In his latest announcements Wednesday, Trump named Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country’s top diplomat; Florida Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general, the top law enforcement position in the government, and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Hawaii Democratic congresswoman turned Republican advocate for the president-elect, as director of national intelligence. On Tuesday, Trump named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to be his next defense secretary. The choice of Hegseth was outside the norm of those usually named as the Pentagon leader. But he was a vocal supporter of Trump during his first term, embracing his 'America First' agenda of trying to withdraw U.S. troops from abroad and often taking up the cause of combat veterans accused of war crimes. Trump has also announced South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his choice for Homeland Security chief and picked John Ratcliffe as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump’s short list of possible vice presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained Trump stalwarts as he won the election. Ratcliffe was the nation’s sixth director of national intelligence, serving for the last eight months of the Trump administration after a rocky confirmation process. Trump also announced that billionaire businessman Elon Musk and entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead what Trump called the Department of Government Efficiency. The announcement said they would provide advice and guidance to 'drive large-scale structural reform' of the federal government. The acronym for the new agency, DOGE, is a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, dogecoin. Other notable picks by Trump include William McGinley as White House counsel, Florida congressman Michael Waltz as national security adviser and Thomas Homan, Trump’s former acting immigration chief, to be 'border czar' to head efforts to deport undocumented migrants, possibly millions of them, who are living in the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcW02XAMeMq0t	2024-11-13T15:37:37-08:00	
Iran’s FM Says That Contact Channels With US Exist	There are still means of contact between Iran and the US despite the fundamental differences, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet session on Wednesday, Araqchi said a series of disagreements between Iran and the US are so foundational that may not be resolved forever. 'However, we need to manage them to reduce the costs and tensions,' he added. The foreign minister noted that the contact channels between Iran and the US are still in place. Asked about Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi’s upcoming visit to Iran, Araqchi said Iran and the UN nuclear agency are involved in extensive and age-old cooperation despite a series of problems and differing views on interaction. Expressing hope that Iran and the IAEA would reach an agreement on a number of differences during Grossi’s visit, Araqchi said the UN nuclear chief has reportedly 'positive morale'. Grossi is scheduled to hold formal meetings with Iranian officials on Thursday, November 14. In an interview with Al Arabiya television channel in September, Grossi expressed the UN nuclear agency’s desire to visit Tehran and hold talks with the administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The IAEA director general also said he had received a response from Pezeshkian on assurances about Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcR-205OfcDJ2	2024-11-13T15:35:36-08:00	
Trumpnomics: Why Is India Resilient To Tariff Wars And America Fi...	Donald Trump’s thumping victory for a return and second term as president has unleashed a mixed bag of signals for India-USA relations. Unlike the first term, rising global political tension due to the Russia-Ukraine war and Russian sanctions have led India’s situation to now be different than when Trump was previously in office. India threw a big challenge to the USA while thwarting Russian sanctions and shifting its oil import dependency to Russia. This led to a new era of India–Russia economic relations, giving an edge for power balancing between the two super powers. Russia emerged as the 6th largest trading partner of India in 2023-24, up from 25th in 2021-22, while USA retained its spot as the top trading partner of India. The climax between India-USA and India-Russia trade relations unveils that oil and oil based products emerged as the major determinants. While oil based petroleum products are one of the major items of exports to the USA, Russian oil has become pivotal to manufacture oil based products, which are then exported to the USA. In 2023-24, Russia accounted for 34.4 percent of India’s total crude oil imports and oil based products accounted for 7.5 percent in total exports to the USA. Eventually, oil and oil based products will emerge as being crucial for India to engage both the USA and Russia as important economic partners during Trump's second period. Given oil is sensitive to inflation, high import tariffs by the Trump administration does not bode well for the USA. To this end, India’s relations with Russia will remain inextricable, notwithstanding the USA's pressure on India to abide by Russian sanctions. Donald Trump claimed in his election campaign that he would impose a 10 percent import tariff on all nations and 60 percent on China. He focused his America First policy, embarking on protectionism, with the end goal to benefit American workers and their families. Nevertheless, during his first term (2017-21), counter measures to restrict imports from India, such as the withdrawal of Special Status under GSP scheme (Generalized System of Preference) and imposition of high tariffs on steel and aluminium, could not instill weapons to dwarf exports from India. During this period, India’s exports to USA sustained unstoppable growth for the first 3 years. The growth trajectory continued during the successive period under the Presidenship of Biden, even though the Biden administration did not relax tariffs. Eventually, the USA continued undeterred to be the biggest export destination for India. How could India overcome Trump’s protectionism in his first term? It lies with the composition of India's export basket. Besides oil products, there are 3 other major products in the export basket. They are gems and jewelry (mainly diamonds), drugs and pharmaceuticals and readymade garments and textiles. Together with petroleum products, these four products accounted for 43 percent of India’s export to USA in 2023-24. One of the main reasons is that for most of these products the USA is import dependent, owing to lackluster domestic manufacturing due to cost effectiveness and skill. For example, India is currently the third biggest exporter of pharmaceutical products and fourth biggest exporter of readymade garments in the USA market. In 2022, it accounted for 5.5 percent of total imports of pharmaceutical products and in 2023, accounted for 7 percent in total imports of readymade garments in USA market. As regards drugs and pharmaceutical products, the USA largely manufactures branded products that are highly profitable. For generic drugs Americans rely on for standard prescriptions like antibiotics, which are predominantly sourced from developing nations where production costs are low, according to Coalition for a Prosperous America. Concerns are looming large in the pharmaceutical and readymade garments industries in India with the Trump’s assertion for imposing 10 percent import. Notwithstanding, there is a caveat. Given the fact that China is the biggest supplier of these two items in USA market and they will attract much higher import tariff sthan India, viz, 60 percent, this will give an edge to India to cut into the share of Chinese products in the USA market. To this end, higher import tariffs on China could give a lease of life to Indian exporters to counter-balance the impact of a 10 hike in import tariffs on Indian products. In addition, the collapse of the Bangladesh government will leverage more scope to Indian exporters for garment exports in the USA market. Bangladesh is the third biggest exporter of garments in the USA market, sharing about 11 percent of imports of garments. Protectionism with regard to immigration is another important threat of Trump’s America First policy. India is the biggest beneficiary of H1B visas. Annually, more than 70 percent of H1B visas is issued to Indians. In his first term, Trump immigration policy increased the denial rate for H1B visas to 24 percent in 2018 and 21 percent in 2019. Nevertheless, this inversely acted in a benign manner to benefit India. Negated by restrictions on immigrants, US IT firms, who were more dependent on India for cost effective employees, opened their branches in India for off-shore services. This led USA investment to soar in India during the Trump period. It made a big leap from US$2.2 billion in 2017 to US$14.3 billion in 2020. The big IT and financial services companies, such as Intel and Morgan Stanley, made bulk investments in India. Currently, nearly 44 percent of US investment in India embraces computer software and hardware (mainly software). In summing up, a new era is likely to emerge for India’s relations with the USA, which will likely mitigate the threat of Trump's protectionism. This should dilute fears for SMEs, who are the backbone of India’s exports of garments and gems and jewelry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8DHWCY69-HV2	2024-11-13T08:57:21-08:00	
Introduction Of Psychology In Economics: The Emergence Of Behavio...	Economics, traditionally a field focused on mathematical models and rationality, experienced a major shift in the late 20th century with the introduction of psychology into its frameworks. This shift marked the birth of behavioral economics—a discipline that blends economic and psychological insights to better understand human decision-making. Unlike classical and neoclassical economics, which assume people make rational, utility-maximizing choices, behavioral economics considers cognitive biases, emotions, and social influences that often lead to irrational or inconsistent behaviors. The integration of psychology into economics has revolutionized our understanding of consumer behavior, public policy, and financial markets, making it one of the most exciting developments in the field. 1. Traditional Economic Models and Their Limitations For much of its history, economics relied on models that depicted individuals as 'homo economicus'—rational agents who always act in their own best interest and consistently make logical choices to maximize their utility. This model offered a simplified, orderly view of human behavior that allowed economists to create mathematical predictions about markets, prices, and consumer choices. However, as economists examined real-world data, they began to notice systematic discrepancies between these theoretical models and actual human behavior. People often made choices that seemed irrational or against their self-interest, defying predictions of classical economic models. For example, people would save less than they knew they should, gamble with risky investments, or prefer immediate rewards over future gains, despite knowing the potential costs. These 'anomalies' suggested that economic models based solely on rationality were incomplete and that human behavior could not be fully understood without accounting for psychological factors. 2. The Birth of Behavioral Economics The integration of psychology into economics began to take shape in the 1970s, led by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Their groundbreaking research on cognitive biases challenged the traditional view of rationality in economic decision-making. In a series of experiments, Kahneman and Tversky identified patterns of 'irrational' behavior that they termed cognitive biases—systematic errors in thinking that affect how people perceive risk, make judgments, and evaluate probabilities. One of their most notable contributions was prospect theory, which demonstrated that people do not evaluate potential losses and gains in a strictly rational way. Instead, they tend to exhibit 'loss aversion,' meaning they feel the pain of losing something more acutely than the pleasure of gaining something of equal value. This insight helped explain why people might hold onto losing investments for too long or avoid taking risks, even when potential gains outweigh potential losses.Behavioral economics, as this new field came to be known, quickly gained traction. It expanded to explore a range of cognitive biases, such as anchoring (relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered), confirmation bias (seeking information that supports one's beliefs), and overconfidence bias (overestimating one's own abilities or knowledge). These insights began reshaping economic thought, challenging the view that individuals act purely out of rational self-interest. 3. The Impact of Psychology on Economic Policy The integration of psychology into economics has had profound implications for public policy. Traditional economic policies often relied on incentives, such as tax breaks or penalties, to influence behavior, assuming people would respond in rational ways. But behavioral economics has shown that people's responses to incentives are often shaped by biases, framing, and social influences. One of the most influential concepts from behavioral economics is nudging—a technique popularized by economist Richard Thaler, who won a Nobel Prize for his contributions to the field. Nudges are subtle interventions that guide people toward making better choices without restricting their freedom. For instance, placing healthier foods at eye level in a cafeteria can encourage healthier eating choices, while automatically enrolling employees in retirement savings plans can help increase savings rates. By understanding the psychological factors behind decision-making, policymakers can design interventions that lead to better outcomes for individuals and society. 4. Behavioral Finance: Psychology in Financial Markets Psychology's influence on economics has also reshaped how we understand financial markets. Behavioral finance, a subfield of behavioral economics, examines how psychological factors influence investment behavior and market outcomes. Researchers have identified cognitive biases that often lead investors to make poor financial decisions, such as the herding effect (following the actions of others) or the endowment effect (overvaluing owned assets). These insights challenge the 'efficient market hypothesis,' which claims that markets are always rational and efficient. Instead, behavioral finance reveals that markets can be irrational and prone to bubbles or crashes fueled by collective biases and emotions. This understanding has influenced asset management, investment strategies, and financial regulations, as well as helped investors avoid common pitfalls. The Future of Economics with Psychological Insights As behavioral economics continues to grow, its influence has broadened beyond academic theory, impacting fields as diverse as marketing, healthcare, education, and environmental policy. The blending of psychology with economics has not only provided a more accurate view of human behavior but also sparked innovations in how we approach social issues and design economic systems. In the coming years, behavioral economics is likely to become even more integral to economics as a whole, integrating insights from neuroscience, sociology, and artificial intelligence. By embracing the complexity of human psychology, economics is evolving into a discipline that is not only more realistic but also more attuned to the diverse factors shaping human decisions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8OMa83tGKrNn	2024-11-13T08:55:07-08:00	
The Introduction Of Psychology In International Relations: A New ...	For much of its history, international relations (IR) was shaped by political theories that emphasized power, state interests, and strategic decision-making. Traditional schools of thought, such as realism and liberalism, have largely assumed that states act as rational, unitary actors pursuing clear national interests. However, this perspective often overlooks the complexities of human psychology, including emotions, cognitive biases, and social identities, all of which profoundly shape the behavior of leaders, policymakers, and citizens. In recent decades, the introduction of psychology into IR has provided valuable insights, highlighting how mental processes influence foreign policy decisions, shape conflicts, and determine the outcomes of diplomatic efforts. This article explores the role of psychology in international relations, examining its impact on the understanding of leadership, group dynamics, conflict escalation, and peace negotiations. Through psychological theories, IR scholars gain a richer, more nuanced understanding of international events, moving beyond simplistic models of rationality to account for the complexities of human behavior in global politics. 1. The Traditional Theories of International Relations and Their Limitations International relations theories have historically focused on material factors, such as military capabilities, economic power, and geopolitical interests. Realism, for example, assumes that states act rationally to maximize their security and power, often operating in an anarchic international system. Liberalism, by contrast, emphasizes cooperation, democratic institutions, and the role of international organizations in promoting peace. While these theories provide valuable frameworks for understanding state behavior, they often neglect the human elements that shape decision-making. Traditional IR theories tend to treat states as 'black boxes,' analyzing interactions between them without delving into the internal processes that drive decisions. But as psychology has entered the field, scholars have started to investigate how cognitive biases, emotions, and individual leadership traits influence foreign policy. By incorporating psychological insights, researchers are uncovering the limitations of models based on purely rational decision-making and gaining a deeper appreciation of the complex dynamics at play in international relations. 2. Leadership Psychology: How Leaders Shape International Relations One of the most influential areas of psychological research in IR concerns the role of individual leaders. Leaders' personalities, values, and cognitive processes significantly influence their decisions, sometimes even shaping the course of entire nations. Psychological theories offer insights into how leaders' personalities affect their foreign policy choices, particularly in times of crisis.• Personality Traits and Decision-MakingStudies show that leaders' personalities can strongly influence their political choices. For instance, leaders with high levels of openness may be more inclined to seek diplomatic solutions, while those with high levels of aggression or narcissism might favor confrontational approaches. Psychological profiling of leaders can reveal tendencies toward risk-aversion, compromise, or assertiveness, helping IR scholars and diplomats anticipate possible policy shifts and reactions. Cognitive Biases and Misjudgments Leaders are subject to cognitive biases that impact their perception of international events. One notable example is confirmation bias, where leaders seek information that supports their preconceived beliefs, leading to flawed assessments and potential conflicts. During the Cold War, both U.S. and Soviet leaders often misinterpreted each other's actions due to deeply entrenched biases, escalating tensions that nearly resulted in nuclear conflict. Emotional Influences on Decision-Making Emotions play a significant role in international relations, especially in high-stakes situations. Fear, anger, and pride can drive leaders to make irrational choices that defy strategic logic. For example, fear of perceived threats can lead to preemptive strikes, while national pride can make it difficult for leaders to make compromises or concede territory. 3. Group Dynamics and the Psychology of Policymaking Teams Psychology has also illuminated the ways in which group dynamics within governments and advisory teams influence foreign policy decisions. Decisions are rarely made by a single leader; instead, they emerge from interactions among small groups of advisors, diplomats, and military officials, each with their own perspectives and motivations. Psychological insights into group behavior reveal how groupthink, social identity, and in-group biases shape policy outcomes. Groupthink and Foreign Policy Groupthink occurs when a cohesive group strives for consensus, leading members to suppress dissenting opinions. This phenomenon has been implicated in several foreign policy failures, such as the U.S. decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Groupthink can prevent policymakers from critically assessing the risks and consequences of their actions, leading to flawed decisions based on incomplete information. Social Identity and National Interests Social identity theory posits that individuals derive part of their self-concept from their group memberships, which can influence international relations. Leaders and policymakers may prioritize the interests of their 'in-group' (such as their nation or ethnic group) and perceive 'out-groups' (foreign nations or cultures) as threats. This tendency can lead to increased nationalism, stereotyping, and conflict escalation, making cooperation more challenging. Collective Emotions and Public Opinion National crises, wars, and diplomatic tensions often evoke strong emotions among the public. Leaders, in turn, may feel pressure to respond in ways that align with popular sentiment, even if those responses are not strategically sound. Collective emotions, such as outrage over an attack or empathy for allied nations, shape public opinion, which influences foreign policy decisions. Psychological studies on collective emotions provide valuable insights into how leaders might respond to crises under domestic pressure. 4. Conflict Escalation and Misperceptions: The Role of Cognitive Biases Cognitive biases often play a critical role in conflict escalation, as states misinterpret each other's intentions, misjudge threats, and overestimate their own abilities. A psychological approach to IR helps explain why conflicts sometimes escalate even when neither party initially desires war. The Attribution Bias Attribution bias occurs when states attribute hostile intentions to others' actions while viewing their own actions as defensive. For example, during the Cold War, both the U.S. and Soviet Union interpreted each other's military build-ups as aggressive, despite seeing their own actions as defensive. This mutual suspicion created a dangerous cycle of arms races and brinkmanship. The Overconfidence Effect Overconfidence bias leads leaders to overestimate their chances of success in conflict, underestimating risks and costs. This bias has been observed in numerous conflicts, where leaders pursue aggressive strategies without fully considering the consequences. For instance, studies suggest that overconfidence played a role in the decisions leading to the Vietnam War, as U.S. leaders underestimated the resilience and commitment of the North Vietnamese forces. The 'Mirror Image' Bias Mirror image bias causes states to view themselves as morally superior while perceiving their adversaries as fundamentally aggressive or dishonest. This bias reinforces hostile perceptions and impedes diplomatic solutions, as neither side is willing to concede or acknowledge the validity of the other's perspective. Recognizing this bias can be a first step toward reducing tensions and fostering dialogue. 5. Negotiation and Peace Processes: Psychological Insights for Conflict Resolution The psychology of negotiation and conflict resolution has made significant contributions to peace processes and diplomatic efforts. Psychological research offers insights into how negotiators can build trust, overcome biases, and foster cooperation. Building Empathy and Trust Research shows that empathy can be a powerful tool in negotiations, allowing parties to understand each other's perspectives and motivations. In peace negotiations, such as those in Northern Ireland, empathy-building exercises have helped negotiators overcome historical grievances, leading to more constructive dialogue. Overcoming Hostility Through Cognitive Reframing Cognitive reframing, or the process of changing how a situation is perceived, can be instrumental in peace negotiations. By reframing issues to focus on common interests rather than historical conflicts, negotiators can reduce hostility and encourage cooperation. This approach was used in the Camp David Accords, where Egypt and Israel were able to reframe their historical animosities to focus on mutual benefits of peace. Promoting Positive Intergroup Contact Psychological theories on intergroup contact suggest that positive interactions between rival groups can reduce prejudice and foster cooperation. In post-conflict settings, programs that bring together former adversaries—such as cultural exchanges, joint economic projects, and educational initiatives—have helped build social cohesion and reduce the risk of renewed conflict. The Future of Psychology in International Relations As global challenges like climate change, migration, and technological disruption reshape the international landscape, psychology will likely play an increasingly important role in IR. Understanding the psychological factors that drive leaders, shape public opinion, and influence intergroup dynamics is essential for developing effective, sustainable solutions to complex global issues. Integrating psychology into IR provides valuable tools for conflict resolution, humanitarian efforts, and diplomatic negotiations. By recognizing the role of human psychology, IR scholars and practitioners can move beyond traditional models to create more adaptive and resilient strategies. In an interconnected world, psychological insights offer a pathway toward more empathetic, cooperative, and stable international relations, helping leaders and nations navigate the complexities of global politics with a deeper understanding of the human mind.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8BnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-13T08:53:26-08:00	
Centcom Conducts Strikes In Yemen, Syria	By C. Todd Lopez Since Friday, U.S. Central Command has conducted strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi targets in Yemen and against targets in Syria as part of the defeat-ISIS mission there. On Saturday and Sunday, Centcom forces executed airstrikes against multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, said Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder during a briefing Tuesday. 'These facilities housed a variety of advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target U.S. and international military and civilian vessels navigating international waters in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' Ryder said. Both Air Force and Navy assets, including F-35C fighter aircraft, were involved in the strikes, which were in response to Houthi attacks on commercial, U.S. and coalition vessels in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden. 'As you've heard us say before, we will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks,' Ryder said. Yesterday, Ryder said, Centcom also conducted strikes against nine targets in two locations associated with Iranian groups in Syria. The strikes, he said, were in response to two attacks on U.S. personnel in Syria that happened Nov. 10 at Mission Support Site Green Village in northeast Syria. One of those attacks involved a UAV, while the second attack involved an indirect fire incident with two rockets. There were no U.S. injuries involved with either attack. Ryder said the U.S. strikes will degrade the ability of Iranian-backed groups to plan and launch future attacks on U.S and coalition forces who are in the region to conduct the defeat-ISIS operations. Centcom commander Army Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla said the U.S. will do what's needed to defend its personnel in the Centcom area of responsibility. 'Our message is clear. Attacks against U.S. and coalition partners in the region will not be tolerated,' said Kurilla. 'We will continue to take every step necessary to protect our personnel and coalition partners and respond to reckless attacks.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8Luofv7p8eIb	2024-11-13T08:51:31-08:00	
American Interventionist Foreign Policy: One And A Quarter Centur...	When Theodore Roosevelt succeeded William McKinley as president in 1901, he realized the US was no longer just a continental republic; with the Spanish-American War of 1898, America now claimed Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines as territories, Cuba a protectorate and annexed Hawaii. Roosevelt 'believed it was the burden of ‘civilized’ nations to uplift ‘uncivilized’ nations,' says Michael Patrick Cullinane. He believed U.S. interests were global interests, and that it was actually good for 'civilized' nations to intervene in other countries’ affairs. Moreover, the 26th president made sure the U.S. played a larger role in international affairs by extending the Monroe doctrine through the Roosevelt Corollary – the United States, henceforth, would protect countries in the Americas from recolonization by European powers, and would intervene militarily if necessary to do so. It was a foreign policy he described as 'speak softly and carry a big stick.' US presidents since Roosevelt have pursued his 'big stick' foreign policy agenda. In the slightly less than a hundred years from 1898 to 1994, the U.S. government (directly or indirectly) has intervened successfully to change governments in Latin America, alone, at least 41 times. That amounts to once every 28 months for an entire century. Overall, while the United States engaged in 46 military interventions from 1948–1991, from 1992–2017 that number increased fourfold to 188. The 'first' Roosevelt era was the beginning of America's orientation towards interventionism – it would influence America’s interventionist policies for the next one and a quarter century. In more than 80 countries worldwide, the US manages over 750 military facilities. With such distribution of military capabilities, it has and continues to influence (if not actually intervene) in major and minor conflicts – most recently in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In May of this year, the Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal called for the US to assist the opposition in overthrowing the Iranian regime after the death in a helicopter crash of Iran’s President, Ebrahim Raisi. And in the 'breadbasket' of Europe, former Deputy Secretary of State (and 'war hawk') Victoria Nuland continued to agitate for greater belligerency – urging the White House to help Ukraine strike deep inside Russian territory. Given the recent incursion by Kiev into Russia’s Kursk region, Biden appears to have acquiesced to that view. The US has since the Second World War and especially after the fall of the Wall in ‘89, pursued foreign policy initiatives that foster calls for escalation, rather than diplomatic discourse, in potentially serious geopolitical situations. In the late 1970s and ’80s, the U.S. funneled billions of dollars to Islamist extremists, including the Mujahideen Muslim guerrilla fighters that resisted the Soviet’s 10-year invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. While those fighters eventually expelled Russian influence, they later fought each other for dominance. In the ensuing power struggle (using American weapons), a cadre of those rebels (including Osama Bin Laden) ultimately coalesced into the Taliban, al-Qaeda – and 911. Since 9/11, America has expended over $8 trillion on wars with 'enemies' and 'friends' in the Middle East. Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen define the former – Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan the latter. And this while thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of civilians perish in America's foreign policy interventions to 'nation-build' and make the Middle East safe for democracy. Yet, irrespective of America’s decades-long failed foreign policy initiatives in the region, there are those who remain sanguine about further meddling in the Middle East. America's history in Iran is a prime example of what we should not have done in the past and should not do in the future. In 1953, the U.S. CIA along with Britain’s MI6 engineered the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The latter had nationalist leanings and opposed British petroleum companies’ exclusive oil rights in the country. The West further feared (without substantiation) that Mosaddegh had Communist sympathies that might push him to support the Soviets. Following the coup, the U.S. installed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – a brutal dictator – loyal to the policies of the West. Decades of the Shah’s repressive rule inspired hatred toward America that culminated in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and the Iranian Revolution. The Shah was ousted and the government replaced with the theocratic Islamic Republic we have today. And as we saw earlier, some want the U.S. to (once more) overthrow an Iranian government we were instrumental in bringing to power. Former Congressman Ron Paul said it very well in 2008: Terrorists 'don’t come here and attack us because we’re rich and we’re free. They come and they attack us because we’re over there.' The wars in Iraq are quintessential examples of American foreign policy initiatives based on shortsighted aims of neoconservative ideology during the George W. Bush years. Personal enmity and faulty (or unpopular) intelligence resulted in thousands of Americans killed based on a false premise. There never were any weapons of mass destruction – just the hatred of an arrogant Iraqi leader and the questionable notion of nation-building in the Middle East. Today, the wars continue. The US played an integral role in the events that led to the devastating war between Russia and Ukraine. Despite the fall of the Soviet Union in ‘89, NATO remained intact and expanded eastward. Soviet expert George Kennan, a key architect of US Cold War policy, warned such action would be 'a tragic mistake' that would ultimately provoke 'a bad reaction from Russia.' For over a decade now, against the warnings of former ambassador to Russia and current CIA Director William Burns, the U.S. has openly advocated for Ukrainian entry into NATO, a hard 'red line' for Russia. Even though Western meddling in the affairs of Ukraine was anathema to the Russians, the U.S. helped engineer a coup to overthrow the democratically elected president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. The latter had announced that he would sign an economic agreement with Russia instead of the E.U. This would eventually lead to the Ukraine-Russia war currently in its second year of hostilities. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has disclosed that in 2021 (one year before the Ukraine-Russia conflict began) Russia sent NATO a draft treaty regarding Ukraine. The terms required NATO to abandon any future plans of expansion as a precondition for Russia not invading Ukraine. The West refused. Only then did Russia invade. The invasion, while reprehensible, certainly was telegraphed by Moscow and with no less than due warning. Recent research by Monica Duffy Toft, professor of international politics at Tufts, is instructive. The US she finds, is indeed engaging in military interventions more often than previously, and for different reasons. 'The rate of interventions has accelerated over time, and since the end of the Cold War, we’ve been pursuing fewer and lower national interests,' says Toft. Just since the year 2000, Toft's 5-year research project documents 72 interventions. And in one region of the world, the Middle East and North Africa, the U.S. has been involved in 77 military interventions, mostly since the 1940s. Toft likens the current state of U.S. foreign policy to a game of 'whack-a-mole,' in which the U.S. sees issues popping up and has 'only one way of dealing with them, which is the hammer' of military force. The professor is clear in her assessment: Overreliance on destabilizing sanctions and military force rather than diplomacy, intelligence gathering, economic statecraft, and the powers of persuasion harms America's reputation abroad, causing itself to be viewed as a threat – diminishing its influence in the process. America's current self-imposed role as the 'world's policeman' is a capitulation of US diplomatic leadership. But this is what happens when a great country like the United States allows decades of mediocre leadership to prevail. Political agendas produce foreign policy initiatives (Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine) inconsistent with what is in the best interest of America. US foreign policy should seek two objectives: Keeping America safe and fostering America’s economic and political hegemony through strategic leadership rather than jeopardizing both by trying to be the 'world's policeman.' Professor Toft declares against an isolationist position, but neither she says should America's foreign policy default position be one of military intervention first. A century of this has failed to produce a safer world for anyone – including America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8B8w23QCkPP1	2024-11-13T08:50:06-08:00	
Russian Experts Find Trump’s Ukraine Policy Fanciful – OpEd	Since Zelensky will not accept Trump's purported peace plan, he should be replaced by a more amenable Ukrainian leader, a Russian expert has said. Russian foreign policy experts are broadly appreciative of US President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy pronouncements. But they have grave doubts about his ability to get Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to sit across a table and thrash out a mutually acceptable way of ending the war. Russian experts writing in Russia Today website find Trump's approach to the Ukraine question to be based on simplistic notions and not on a good understanding of the deep-rooted sentiments among Ukrainians about independence from Russia. Also, Trump has not grasped the Russia's well-founded fears about Europe and NATO using Ukraine against it. In fact, one of the experts even hinted that the only way Trump can bring an end to the war is by bringing about a regime change in Ukraine to bring in a leader who is amenable to giving Russia the concessions it expects to ensure its security. Appreciating the general drift of Trump's foreign policy, Fyodor Lukyanov says: 'Trump stands for a change in positioning. Instead of global dominance, there will be a vigorous defence of specific American interests. Priority will be given to those that bring clear benefits, not in the long term, but now.' Lukyanov goes further and says that Trump's belief in the primacy of domestic over foreign policy, which has always characterized Trump's supporters and has now spread throughout the Republican Party, means that his choice of international issues is going to be selective and restricted. 'Preserving the moral and political hegemony of the US is not an end in itself, but a tool. In such a system of priorities, the Ukrainian project loses the destiny it has in the eyes of the adherents of the liberal order. It becomes a pawn in a larger game,' Lukyanov points out. Another peculiarity he sees in Trump, is that the President-elect doesn't see war as an acceptable tool. 'Yes, Trump will use hard bargaining, muscle-flexing and coercive pressure (as practiced in his usual business), but not destructive armed conflict, because that is irrational.' Lukyanov looks at Trump's previous term and notices his refreshing approach to regional conflicts. One was the 'Abraham Accords', an agreement that facilitated formal relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries. The second was the meetings with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, including a full-fledged summit in Hanoi. 'The first was the result of shuttle diplomacy by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. The powerful financial interests of America, the Gulf monarchies and Israel led to a series of shady political deals. The current situation in the region is many times worse than it was then, but it cannot be said that the arrangements (the Abraham Accords) have collapsed. The framework is still in place,' Lukyanov asserts. However, that Middle Eastern settlement model may not be applicable to the situation in the Ukraine conflict, where the warring parties are fighting for their very existence and where room for manoeuvre is more limited. Be that as it may, it cannot be denied that Trump has thrown open a window of opportunity for Russia and Ukraine to explore solutions so that the extremely destructive war is brought to an end, Lukyanov says. But a leading Russian columnist on military affairs, Mikhail Khodarenok, is less sanguine. He is convinced that Trump's reported Ukraine peace plan is doomed to fail. Khodarenok quotes Wall Street Journal to say that Trump envisages a suspension of military operations along the front line, the creation of a demilitarized zone (DMZ), a guarantee that Ukraine won't join NATO for at least 20 years, and the West continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons. Wall Street Journal further says that Trump's promise to end the war by January's Inauguration Day puts him in the position of having to choose between competing proposals from his advisers, though all advisors are agreed on one basic point, that Joe Biden's plans to transfer arms and military equipment to Ukraine 'for as long as it takes' should be rejected outright. Khodarenok recalls that throughout his election campaign, Trump had sharply criticized Biden's handling of Ukraine, warning that it had brought the world closer to World War III, and that Ukraine had cheated the US out of billions of dollars in free weapons. According to Wall Street Journal Trump has not yet approved the final plan for resolving the conflict. He intends to continue discussing it with his closest advisers, the paper said. It is not clear what the de-militarized Zone (DMZ) would look like. Does it cover all the regions taken by Russia including the Crimean Peninsula? And if the classic definition of a DMZ is applied, military facilities on it must be removed, and the deployment of armed forces, the fortification of the terrain, and the conduct of combat and operational training activities on it are prohibited. According to the purported plan, the US will continue to supply Ukraine with arms and other military equipment. The US has promised this only to keep the Russians in check and prevent them from swiftly moving in and taking over all of Ukraine In all likelihood, Ukraine will reject this package, Khodarenok says. Maintaining the security regime in the DMZ will require, among other things, the presence of a contingent of peacekeepers (if only to separate the parties' forces). But since the US will not put its boots on the ground, its European allies may have to contribute units. Then, there is the question of Russia being allowed to keep (for ever), the territories it captured. Also, the role of NATO has to be restricted. According to Wall Street Journal, Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO for the next 20 years. Khodarenok wonders if such an assurance can be extracted from Ukraine when it is mortally afraid of Russia. And what is the sanctity of a 20-year bar on entering NATO, he asks. The Russian expert says the Ukrainian leadership will be the main stumbling block on the road to peace, as they completely and 'insanely' believe that there is only one way to keep the Russians away, and that is to defeat them militarily. But Ukraine lacks the means to do so. According to the expert, the only way in which Trump can move forward on Ukraine is to install in Kiev a new leadership capable of fulfilling his peace plan. The leadership should be reasonable, only then will negotiations be possible, Khodarenok says. In other words, Trump US must bring a regime change in Ukraine as part of the peace process.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0rjmhE2TKDTJ	2024-11-13T08:48:15-08:00	
Tripolar Instability: Nuclear Competition Among The United States...	The development of nuclear weapons by the erstwhile Soviet Union (USSR) in 1949 marked the beginning of nuclear polarisation between the USSR and the US, which became the major element of the Cold War. China joined the nuclear club when it crossed the nuclear threshold in 1964 and maintained a minimum deterrence policy with a No First Use (NFU) doctrine. However, recent developments in Taiwan Straits, South and East China Seas have transformed the strategic status quo compelling China to work towards achieving a more favorable nuclear equation vis-a-vis the US in terms of warheads and delivery systems, altering the strategic landscape in response to the changing global environment. In his book Tripolar Instability: Nuclear Competition among the United States, Russia and China, Robert Litwak explores the transition from a bipolar nuclear world to what Henry Kissinger called 'a new era' of tripolar nuclear security and rivalry between the US, Russia and China. The book comprises four chapters. First chapter addresses the destabilising shift from the two great powers (US and USSR) to an emergent tripolar nuclear order in which China seeks to maintain a balance of power with the US and Russia. Chapters two and three describe the strategic stability as an interaction between arms race stability and crisis stability. The final chapter assesses the risks and challenges to security in the event of a tripolar world phenomenon in which the rules-based system has been largely destroyed. The theme of the book revolves around the argument that the combination of emerging nuclear tripolarity and geostrategic tensions over Ukraine and Taiwan are recreating two interlocking Cold War risks. These factors threaten to undermine both arms race stability and crisis stability – the two elements that comprise strategic stability (p.6). Analysts have identified two major risks in the emergent tripolar nuclear order: (i) the stability-instability paradox; and (ii) balance of terror. The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was a clear example of the potentially catastrophic consequences of 'unmanaged competition' between the US and the USSR. In its aftermath, a key factor in strategic stability has been the threat of retaliation, based on assured second-strike nuclear capability. From this perspective, China’s development of a larger survivable nuclear force may play a stabilising role (p.87) by deterring potential aggression from other nuclear powers and reducing the risk of nuclear conflict. Litwak, in describing the transition period of the post-Cold War era, argues that the triangular relationship among the three powers – US, Russia and China – has created new strategic challenges and complexities that are not adequately addressed by existing nuclear deterrence theories and arms control agreements. According to the author, each leg of the triangle is not equivalent because of the uneven distribution of their power (economic and military) and trilateral politics, which have evolved over the decades. (p.22) One of the book’s strengths lies in its thorough analysis of each country’s nuclear strategy and posture. Litwak delves into the doctrinal shifts, modernisation efforts, and strategic calculations that underpin the nuclear policies of the US, Russia and China. He provides a nuanced understanding of how these countries perceive each other’s capabilities and intentions, and how these perceptions shape their respective approaches to deterrence and arms control. For example, the US withdrawal from Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, had implications for the sufficiency of China’s minimum deterrent posture. Secondly, the termination of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, concluded with the Soviet Union in 1988, could now permit US deployment of intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Asia to counter China. (p.33) The author has also explored the implications of emerging technologies, such as hypersonic weapons, missile defense systems, cyber capabilities and artificial intelligence, on the strategic stability of the tripolar nuclear competition. The extension of strategic competition into the domains of cyberspace and outer space creates additional escalatory risks that undermine crisis stability. He raises important questions about the potential for miscalculation and inadvertent escalation in today’s more complex and less predictable environment. Beyond assessment, Litwak also offers thoughtful policy recommendations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with tripolar nuclear competition. He advocates renewed diplomatic engagement and avoiding the use of conventional military weapons to prevent inadvertent escalation among the three powers, emphasising the need for innovative arms control frameworks that account for the realities of the current strategic landscape. The author also underscores the importance of crisis communication mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of accidental or unintended conflict. (p.107) The book is well-researched and comprehensive in its contents. The issues discussed are complex and require close attention of the reader. However, for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners in the field of global security, Litwak’s analysis provides invaluable insights and a fresh perspective on the evolving dynamics of nuclear competition in the 21st century. The author’s work stands out for its depth of analysis and relevance to contemporary global security challenges. The book not only elucidates the dangers inherent in the current tripolar nuclear order but also offers a constructive path forward for reducing the risks associated with catastrophic conflicts. The book is a timely contribution to the discourse on global security, particularly in an era marked by growing geopolitical tensions and the erosion of established arms control frameworks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0jDFtH9RotFd	2024-11-13T08:46:07-08:00	
Will Artificial Intelligence Develop At The Expense Of Natural In...	Since time immemorial, humans have taken pride in the natural intelligence they possess, which helps them analyse information, process ideas, assess the pros and cons of various scenarios, and arrive at firm judgements. This is an essential human attribute that animals lack, as they are driven solely by survival instincts and do not possess the capacity to discern between good and bad. While this natural intelligence—featuring analytical ability, memory power, and the capability for quick thinking and logical conclusions—is inherent in every human being, it must be developed and fine-tuned through practice. If neglected, this ability will become dormant and may decline over time. Failure to nurture and apply our natural intelligence effectively amounts to disregarding this God-given capacity. At a recent consultative meeting, a school teacher from India shared an anecdote illustrating how the learning process is evolving among young students in line with technological advancements and the proliferation of electronic gadgets. The teacher recounted asking a student his age, to which he correctly responded, '12 years and 4 months.' When asked for his grandfather's age, the student also answered correctly, saying, '79 years and 3 months.' However, when asked to calculate the difference between the two ages within 20 seconds, the student initially tried to count on his fingers before starting to look around. Upon being asked what he was searching for, he replied, 'A calculator.' The teacher noted that, in earlier times, mental arithmetic exercises were common in schools. Teachers would give students timed sums to solve mentally, aiming to encourage quick and alert thinking among students in their formative years. Nowadays, however, this practice seems to be disappearing, with many young students relying on calculators for basic arithmetic. In the past, teachers also insisted that students memorise tables and poems, a practice intended to strengthen memory from an early age—an invaluable skill as they grew older. Similarly, précis writing was once considered an essential exercise for helping students distil the key points of a text, organise information, and convey it succinctly, aiding comprehension for the reader. Today, however, this practice appears to be fading, with many believing artificial intelligence can accomplish this task instead. With the growth of technology, even public speaking has transformed. Many speakers now rely on teleprompters, and the art of extemporaneous speaking, which requires a dynamic thought process tailored to the occasion, seems to be diminishing. In another instance, a college student studying world history was asked by his teacher to quickly outline the events leading to World War II. The student responded that he would need to open his laptop to retrieve the information. When the teacher stressed the importance of memory, the student replied that, in his view, it was unnecessary to retain such details when they are readily available online. He added that he didn't see the point in using his mental resources for information that could be accessed instantly on the internet. Taken aback, the teacher was left questioning whether the student's perspective might be valid. Noticing his teacher's confusion, the student politely suggested that he 'use artificial intelligence to find an answer'! Despite the rise of artificial intelligence, fostering and utilising natural intelligence remains crucial. Artificial intelligence itself must be guided and assessed by natural intelligence, given that it is a creation of human ingenuity. Therefore, excessive dependence on artificial intelligence for analysis, interpretation, and judgement may pose significant risks. While artificial intelligence offers an impressive array of tools, it should be seen as a limited aid, not a comprehensive solution. Artificial intelligence is still an evolving field, and policies regarding its use are yet to be fully developed or standardised globally. Currently, there is no international consensus on the strategies and frameworks for its implementation. For humanity to progress as a civilised society, natural intelligence, memory power, analytical ability, and the capacity to discern right from wrong based on ethical values are indispensable. In short, natural intelligence can be complemented but never wholly replaced by artificial intelligence. Let it not be a case of artificial intelligence versus human intelligence; rather, let artificial intelligence be scrutinised, evaluated, and deployed thoughtfully by natural intelligence at all times.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0iUZlNZE-2vR	2024-11-13T08:44:17-08:00	
Turkey Cannot Halt Oil Shipments From Azerbaijan To Israel Withou...	Turkey lacks the authority to halt oil shipments from Azerbaijan to Israel without a UN sanctions resolution. At most, Turkey can request or advise Azerbaijan on the matter. Ultimately, Azerbaijan has the sole right to decide who buys its oil. If Turkey were to block shipments through the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) pipeline because they are destined for Israel, it would be liable for compensating investors and producers for their financial losses. The agreements governing BTC, IGA, and HGA pipelines are structured to protect such investments; otherwise, investors would be unwilling to fund these major projects. The BTC pipeline and the broader East-West energy corridor were initially conceived with the goal of securing energy supplies for Israel. For instance, prior to the Blue Stream project, there was the Lassere Project, which aimed to transport natural gas to Israel. Gazprom, one of the Lassere Project partners, adapted the plan to cross the Black Sea, proposing three pipeline routes: two lines for Turkey and one for Israel, each with a capacity of 8 billion cubic meters. However, when Israel discovered its own offshore natural gas reserves, the Israeli pipeline portion of the project was abandoned. The United States places a high priority on ensuring Israel's energy security, given Israel's role as its most important ally in the region. From their perspective, this focus is understandable. We are not presenting these observations as a criticism but to illustrate that the realities we recognized in the past are now becoming more widely understood.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0jwEB3BCQvc6	2024-11-13T08:40:21-08:00	
Ukraine ‘Outgunned And Outnumbered’: Desertions En Masse – OpEd	Early 2022 witnessed the high morale of the Ukrainian military and civilian population resulting in to be a force multiplier for the Ukrainian army’s defense power against the war with Russia. In comparison, the low morale of the Russian supported forces and military near neutralized Russia’s overwhelming military superiority over Ukraine in the early months of the war. The initial euphoria of February 2022 of joining the forces to protect their motherland has evaporated, owing to an astronomical number of deaths. Ukraine’s military is now ‘Outgunned and Outnumbered’, struggling with low morale and high rate of desertions. As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops have started to desert. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. This prolonged war nearing three years have near decimated many Ukrainian infantry battalions making the situation grim on the battle fronts. Reinforcements are few and difficult to be created, leaving soldiers exhausted, demoralized and desert. Despite Ukrainian President Zelensky determined to continue fighting the war, young Ukrainians are fiercely opposing conscription and refusing to go to the warfront to get killed. The escalating fighting along a more than 1,000-km front line is stretching Ukraine's already outnumbered troops. Ukraine said on Nov 11 that its hard-pressed military was battling 50,000 troops in Russia's Kursk region to its north, while also scrambling to reinforce two besieged fronts in the east and bracing to meet an infantry assault in the south. Crucially, soldiers say they are poorly armed and complain of having the enemy in sight, watching them advance, and being unable to fire because they have no ammunition, according to accounts from soldiers reported by CNN. The figures vary Truth is the first casualty in any war and so has been in this Ukraine- Russia War. True statistics are not available from both the nations and their militaries. The casualty figures and damage destruction estimates for both sides have been exaggerated for the opposing sides! Military War Casualties. Citing a confidential estimate from Ukraine earlier this year, the report suggested that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died, while 400,000 had been wounded. Meanwhile, Western intelligence estimates suggest Russian losses range from 200,000 dead to around 400,000 wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have kept their war casualties confidential. In February, Ukrainian President Zelensky stated that around 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed. However, former political and security officials believe this figure underplays the true scale of losses in order to maintain public morale and continue recruitment efforts. Desertions. According to the Kyiv Post, it is believed that about 60,000 people have been facing criminal charges for fleeing their posts since the war started. However, British daily The Times also cited figures from the prosecutor general which, it said, showed some 51,000 criminal cases were initiated for desertion and abandonment of a military unit between January and September of this year. El Pais cited a closer figure of 45,543 desertions between January and August this year, which it said was data from the Prosecutor General’s Office which had been leaked to the Ukrainian press. Ukraine’s youth not willing to fight a war that’s not their own. Ukrainian army today faces a serious desertion crisis as 30,000-plus soldiers have already fled from their posts. Civilian Deaths. As of 31 August, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) had verified that conflict-related violence had killed 11,743 civilians and injured 24,614 in Ukraine since 24 February 2022.Independent assessments have put the civilian toll closer to 100,000. Migrants. Some 14 million Ukrainian Migrantshave fled their homes either to other countries or other parts of Ukraine. According to the UN refugee agency, Poland is sheltering more than 1.5 million people from Ukraine. Will the majority migrants ever come back. Russian leaflets calling for Ukrainian troops surrender Russian troops dropped leaflets using drones with special QR codes (23 September 2024) calling for the surrender of Ukrainian troops, who are still entrenched in Novoukrainka in the South Donetsk direction west of Ugledar. Each leaflet dropped contained a call to immediately abandon their weapons, giving the enemy the opportunity to surrender on the battlefield, and instructions on how to do so, before their positions are powerfully stormed! The two-year battle for Ugledar, is likely to end with a victory for the Russian troops! This situation was expected much earlier and truth had to prevail about the ground reality; 'They do not want to fight because they don’t see a clear cause worth fighting for: they are beginning to realize that they are not fighting for Ukraine; at best, they’re fighting for Zelensky and his circle, who are profiting tremendously from this Ukrainian tragedy. They realize that they are fighting for Europe and for the Americans, and that neither Zelensky, nor the Europeans, nor the Americans care about Ukrainian lives.' As part of the plan to boost morale of the front-line troops specially trained officers are posted to provide moral and psychological support. No one talks of Peace including the UN The US, NATO and the West wants the war to continue and escalate in order to weaken Russia. Zelensky has a so called ‘Victory Plan’ if adequately supported by the Western allies led by the US. From the heads of states of the stake holders to gun makers, traders, diplomats, the war is lucrative for everyone. Will the US President-elect Donald Trump having promised to bring an end to these ongoing wars of Ukraine and Gaza succeed? Both the wars have brought profit and prosperity to the US arms industry. Militarism is the US national religion 'We believe in wars. We may no longer believe in formal declarations of war…We believe in weaponry, the more expensive the better'. Will Donald Trump change this American belief in his second tenure as the US President? No one talks of Peace including the UN. The powerful players do not listen to the UN.

Pollsters Miss ‘Sleeper Issues’ – OpEd	Pollsters seeking to tap what is on the mind of voters are right to focus on the big issues: the economy, illegal immigration, crime, abortion, education, healthcare, foreign policy, and the like. But there are other matters that affect voters, though they are not front and center in most people’s minds. They are more like 'sleeper issues.' Lots of Americans these days, especially those in their middle years and older, are voicing a sense of uneasiness, even bewilderment, about the state of our society in general. Their apprehension is not necessarily rooted in something that Washington has done. It’s more a realization that things have gotten out of whack. Extremes dominate. In large part, the extremes are rooted in culture, not politics. We can tell from public opinion research that Americans are very concerned about the moral direction of the country. Selfishness, self-absorption, rudeness, and a complete disregard for the rights and sensibilities of others is evident in school and the workplace. Inappropriate use of cell phones—on trains and buses and in bars and restaurants—is commonplace. Those who sport vulgar lyrics and videos take no responsibility for how they corrupt young people. Car drivers are increasing distracted and unwilling to yield. Those on bicycles and scooters—the motorized ones are the worst—show no regard for public safety. All of these things feed the perception that America is becoming unhinged. The fact that few are held accountable for their transgressions makes things worse. There are also policy issues that matter in this regard. When school officials and politicians aid and abet mentally challenged young people who want to transition to the opposite sex—absent parental consent—they are contributing to our culture of opportunism. Ditto for hospitals that exploit these disturbed minors by fast-tracking the changes. It’s all about ideological extremism and greed. It could be argued that it would be illogical for voters to blame politicians for the cultural issues that are making people uneasy. Technically, that is true. But in the real world, we are all a blend of reason and emotion. In other words, those upset with extremism in the culture are likely to blame officials who harbor an extremist political agenda for cultural depravities. For example, politicians who believe that tampons should be put in boys’ bathrooms are clearly not responsible for those who talk loudly on their cell phones in public places, but because they promote extremist policies, voters may see them as emblematic of our overall condition. This is the kind of 'sleeper issue' that is in the back of people’s minds. Such issues are capable of exploding at election time—it’s like a frustration time bomb—yet they are not likely to be discerned by pollsters. In short, cultural issues are often treated as insignificant by pollsters during election season. This explains, in part, why they are so often wrong in their prognostications. What’s in the back of people’s minds has a way of leaping to the front, or at least becoming more important, when they cast their ballot. The price for extremism is costly in a democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0kx3cU0zDwjT	2024-11-13T08:34:43-08:00	
Karachi-Chittagong Ports Connectivity Between Pakistan And Bangla...	On November 13, a direct cargo ship from Karachi, Pakistan, arrived in the port of Chittagong, Bangladesh, establishing the first-ever direct maritime connection between the two nations. This was a huge step to strengthen the connections. The Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea bind Bangladesh and Pakistan, who are close neighbors. Both nations would gain from the growth of these marine linkages in terms of regional communications, trade, and investment. 2907 nautical miles separate the ports of Chittagong, Bangladesh, and Karachi, Pakistan. Trade was conducted through Singapore and other nearby ports due to the lack of marine connectivity between Chattogram Port and Pakistan's port in Karachi. Consequently, trading volumes have not yet reached a noteworthy level. However, Pakistan and Bangladesh are positioned well on a number of economic indices. Therefore, they wish to use this marine link to improve bilateral commerce. Although ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan remained chilly under Sheikh Hasina's 15-year administration, optimism about the possible normalization of comprehensive economic connections has been reignited by Bangladesh's recent political upheaval. Bangladesh is looking for additional overseas partners to help it overcome the present economic issues. Therefore, increasing trade and economic cooperation as well as looking into joint ventures and investment possibilities may be advantageous to both parties and promote regional development. The direct route promises to save travel times and greatly simplify supply networks. With an expected capacity of 2,300 TEUs and the ability to carry a wide range of cargo, the ship's journey demonstrates the rising need for direct trade between the two nations. In addition to creating a more integrated commerce network throughout the area, Syed Ahmed Maroof, Pakistan's High Commissioner to Bangladesh, described the direct shipping route as a significant step forward in strengthening corporate and bilateral trade connections between Pakistan and Bangladesh. According to him, the program would not only quicken current trade flows but also open up new business prospects for companies of all sizes, from tiny importers to major exporters. Cotton accounted for the majority of Pakistan's $839 million in exports to Bangladesh in 2022. Jute and other textile fibers were Bangladesh's top exports to Pakistan, which brought in $74 million. The majority of Bangladesh's imports from Pakistan include equipment, cotton, salt, and sulfur—raw materials used in the apparel sector. At least $2.95 billion worth of commodities, including textiles, agricultural products, food, chemicals, and more, might be exported from Pakistan to Bangladesh. Bangladesh might potentially be a major market for Pakistani exports like jute and medicinal items. Through organizations like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), both nations might investigate further regional economic integration.With increased commerce between the two nations, there has been a renewed push for the establishment of direct shipping services between the ports of Chittagong and Karachi. The primary seaport in Bangladesh is Chittagong. The Chattagram Port Terminal handles 90% of Bangladesh's commerce, with the remaining 80% going through the ports of Mangla and Payra. For the same reasons and with a notable increase in commerce, Bangladesh may likewise profit from using Pakistan's Gwadar port. commerce between Karachi and Bangladesh's Chittagong, Payra, and Mangla ports will increase commerce and shorten the distance between the two nations. After that, this network may be expanded to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia, and Northeast China. Connectivity at sea is essential. To establish a trilateral access and distribution center, Sri Lanka's Colombo and Hambantota Ports can be used to link Pakistan's Gwadar ports, which include Karachi, Port Qasim, and Keti Bandar, with Bangladesh's Chittagong, Payra, and Mangla ports. Products like cotton are imported by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka from Pakistan, Central Asian nations, Western and Central China, and even Russia. Bangladeshi clothing, pharmaceuticals, fruits, and vegetables, as well as its emerging IT services and electronic sectors, can be combined with Sri Lanka's traditional tea, clothing, rice, and agricultural businesses, as well as emerging mechanical and industrial manufacturing industries like car tires. Bangladesh is well situated to serve as a gateway between SAARC and ASEAN, giving each region's export-oriented businesses possible access to both. Whereas SAARC comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Between Central Asia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Northwest China, Pakistan serves as a gateway and a hub. As a result, supply chain value and regional commerce may be developed in a way never seen before. It is anticipated that direct maritime connectivity between Karachi and Chittagong will be crucial to the growth of trade and commerce between the two nations. They may significantly cut down on the time and expense of shipping products between them, and they will probably be crucial in forging connections with other Middle Eastern and Central Asian nations, such as China and Russia. Direct shipping between the two nations will incentivize traders to increase their regional investment and trade. It is anticipated that both countries would gain from the development of trade and commercial corridors that are coordinated between Bangladesh's Look West Policy and Pakistan's Dhaka rapprochement, as well as from the building of connection through coastal shipping.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0k3v2dZmQm4T	2024-11-13T08:33:00-08:00	
Pakistan’s Potential Benefits From Effectiveness Of CSTO Proposal...	The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a regional security bloc led by Russia, has recently proposed enhancing security around Afghanistan through a comprehensive approach that includes counterterrorism efforts, border security, economic cooperation, and regional diplomatic engagement. This proposal primarily targets Afghanistan's unstable political and security situation and seeks to stabilize the broader Central Asian region. For Pakistan, a key neighboring country to Afghanistan and an important player in the region’s geopolitical dynamics, the success and effectiveness of CSTO’s security proposal could offer several potential benefits. While Pakistan is not a member of the CSTO, its interests align in several ways with the objectives of the organization, making it a key stakeholder in the success of these initiatives. One of the most immediate and significant benefits for Pakistan from the CSTO’s effectiveness would be enhanced regional stability. Afghanistan has long been a source of instability for Pakistan, with various terrorist groups operating along the porous border between the two countries. The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, along with the presence of extremist factions like ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K), has directly impacted Pakistan's security, particularly in the tribal areas and Balochistan province. The CSTO’s proposal to strengthen border security and deploy joint counterterrorism forces along Afghanistan’s borders could reduce the flow of militants into Pakistan. By improving border surveillance and creating stronger intelligence-sharing networks, the CSTO's efforts could help Pakistan better control cross-border insurgent movements, thus alleviating the strain on Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies. In addition, the proposal aims to address the drug trade that funds terrorism. Afghanistan has long been the world’s leading producer of opium, much of which is trafficked into Pakistan. By tackling the roots of this illicit trade, the CSTO’s initiatives could disrupt terrorist financing and reduce the overall level of violence and instability in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Economic development is another area where Pakistan could benefit from the effectiveness of the CSTO’s proposal. The CSTO’s emphasis on regional economic cooperation, particularly in trade, infrastructure development, and job creation, aligns with Pakistan’s interests in expanding economic ties with its neighbors. As a country with a growing economy and a strategic location at the crossroads of Central and South Asia, Pakistan stands to gain from a more stable and prosperous Afghanistan. If the CSTO’s proposal succeeds in fostering regional economic integration, Pakistan could benefit from enhanced trade routes and more open access to Central Asian markets. Afghanistan, situated between Central Asia and Pakistan, is a natural trade corridor. The development of infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and energy pipelines, could improve connectivity between Pakistan’s ports (like Karachi) and Central Asia, offering Pakistan better access to regional markets. Moreover, the CSTO’s security framework could complement Pakistan’s own efforts to combat terrorism and extremism within its borders. By enhancing regional security cooperation, Pakistan would gain from coordinated efforts with Central Asian states, Russia, and other key players in addressing shared security concerns. The CSTO’s approach could open the door for more comprehensive regional security pacts and multilateral initiatives that could help Pakistan deal with its own security challenges, particularly in Balochistan and the tribal areas. While Pakistan’s relations with India are primarily characterized by rivalry, particularly over the disputed Kashmir region, the success of the CSTO’s initiatives could help Pakistan counterbalance India’s growing influence in the region. By engaging with the CSTO’s efforts, Pakistan could ensure that it plays a central role in shaping Afghanistan’s future, while simultaneously preventing India from exerting disproportionate influence in the region. If the CSTO succeeds in stabilizing Afghanistan and creating economic opportunities, the flow of refugees into Pakistan could decrease, alleviating the socio-economic burden on Pakistan’s border provinces. By supporting or engaging with the CSTO’s initiatives, Pakistan could not only secure its own national interests but also contribute to broader regional stability and prosperity. For Pakistan, the CSTO’s efforts represent an important opportunity for regional cooperation, but the country must carefully assess the geopolitical landscape and its own strategic priorities as it seeks to maximize the benefits from these initiatives. The effectiveness of the CSTO’s proposal, coupled with Pakistan’s proactive engagement, could indeed play a significant role in fostering a more stable and prosperous South and Central Asia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0mR71TIEldhh	2024-11-13T08:31:44-08:00	
The Clock Is Ticking On Sub-Saharan Africa’s Urgent Job Creation ...	As the rest of the world grapples with aging populations, Africa’s population is booming. By 2030, half of all new entrants into the global labor force will come from sub-Saharan Africa, requiring the creation of up to 15 million new jobs annually. As the Chart of the Week shows, this challenge is particularly acute in fragile, conflict-affected, and low-income economies. They account for nearly 80 percent of the region’s annual job creation needs, but to date have struggled the most to create jobs. These economies have high fertility rates, with youth populations yet to peak. For example, Niger has a population of 26 million people and a youth population share that is not expected to peak until 2058—the country will need to create 650,000 new jobs annually for the next 30 years. In contrast, many middle-income countries like Botswana, Ghana, Namibia, and Mauritius have seen their youth shares of populations peak already and will face less severe job creation pressures. Harnessing Africa’s booming population growth potential requires generating vast numbers of productive, quality jobs that provide above-subsistence-level income, whether in formal roles or self-employment. There are three main challenges to creating enough good jobs, but policymakers have the tools at their disposal to make a difference. Shifting informal jobs from a trap to a stepping-stone. Targeted policies include boosting productivity in the informal sector through well matched skills training, better access to finance, and policies that encourage transitioning to formal employment. It is valuable to create labor market programs that help young people, especially women who face additional barriers, enter the workforce, ensuring they have the tools to succeed. Creating conditions that are conducive to jobs growth in high-productivity sectors like modern services and manufacturing. Given limited public finances, governments can prioritize measures that benefit multiple sectors, such as improving market competition and making value-for-money infrastructure investments. They should be cautious with industrial policies that target specific sectors, as they can be expensive, distortionary, and pose corruption risks. Breaking down barriers to private business growth. Prioritizing important infrastructure like electricity, internet, roads, and affordable public transport can ease the flow of goods and services. Cutting red tape and curbing corruption will also help companies grow. Attracting more foreign direct investment and developing local capital markets can make more financing available. And strengthening regional integration and trade can expand markets. The international community has much to gain from thriving employment in sub-Saharan Africa. Not only is robust jobs growth good for the countries and the people of the region, but it will also provide an engine of growth, consumption and investment for the global economy. Failure could exacerbate poverty, fuel instability and drive migration, while success can unlock prosperity for both Africa and the globe. Policymakers must strive for meaningful change that will create a path for millions of people toward a brighter jobs future. —This article is based on an analytical note included in the October 2024 Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa, The Clock is Ticking on Sub-Saharan Africa’s Urgent Job Creation Challenge, by Wenjie Chen, Khushboo Khandelwal, Athene Laws, Faten Saliba, Can Sever and Luc Tucker of the IMF’s African Department.

Intelligence Sharing As An Alternative To ‘Asian NATO’ – Analysis	By Asher Ellis Recent proposals for a military alliance in the Asia Pacific region risk escalating tensions and overlooking regional dynamics. A different approach — focused on intelligence sharing — offers a pragmatic way to enhance regional security while maintaining stability. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office in October 2024, drew international attention just weeks into his term by advocating for an ‘Asian version of NATO‘. His proposal has faced significant pushback from China, which accuses Japan of escalating tensions and promoting a ‘Cold War mentality‘, and from the United States and several Southeast Asian nations wary of increasing regional tensions. The US ambassador to Japan has echoed the need for enhanced regional cooperation, albeit advocating for a different approach. He proposed an economic trade–defence alliance aimed at countering China’s coercion rather than a traditional military pact. The need for enhanced cooperation in the Asia Pacific is clear. Chinese aggression against Taiwan, the militarisation of artificial islands in the South China Sea and North Korea’s ongoing missile testscontinue to exacerbate regional security concerns. But adopting a Cold War-era alliance model, designed for a different geopolitical context, is impractical. It overlooks the region’s complex geography, diverse political and economic systems and many Asian states’ significant economic ties with China. Instead, the United States and its Asian partners should focus on enhancing intelligence-sharing efforts. Existing frameworks — such as the Quad partnership between the United States, India, Japan and Australia — have made progress in maritime domain awareness and cybersecurity. The Quad’s Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness leverages advanced satellite-based radio frequency data to aid partner countries in monitoring their waters more effectively. Australia has engaged extensively in intelligence cooperation with its neighbours, both bilaterally and multilaterally, particularly in fields such as policing and counterterrorism. This cooperation dates back to responses to the Bali and Jakarta bombings in the early 2000s, efforts to combat piracy and smuggling in maritime Southeast Asia and support during events like the Marawi siegein the Philippines in 2017. Some Asian countries also engage in bilateral intelligence-sharing efforts. The General Security of Military Information Agreement between South Korea and Japan facilitates the exchange of sensitive military information. But it exists largely due to US mediation and pressure, underscoring the United States’ role in brokering and sustaining such frameworks. ASEAN’s ‘Our Eyes’ Initiative aims to facilitate intelligence exchange among Southeast Asian nations, focusing on counterterrorism and violent extremism. New efforts between the United States and the Philippines, as well as between the United States, Japan and Taiwan, seek to increase intelligence sharing in specific contexts, such as cyber threats and geospatial intelligence. Despite these initiatives, intelligence sharing in Asia remains sporadic and lacks integration into broader networks, leaving gaps that adversaries could exploit. To build a more cohesive regional security network, countries like the United States and Japan must broaden their efforts, starting with less sensitive but highly valuable domains to build trust and demonstrate the benefits of cooperation. Geospatial intelligence, derived from satellite imagery and remote sensors, is becoming less sensitive due to the growing availability of commercial satellite data, but is helpful for monitoring shipping lanes, detecting illegal activities and responding to natural disasters. The growth of open-source intelligence datasets from private companies can also enhance the capabilities of countries with limited traditional intelligence assets. Cyber threat intelligence is another area ripe for collaboration, as nations face common threats from cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure and government networks. Collaboration in these domains would help establish a shared understanding of regional security challenges. To facilitate this cooperation, the United States and its Asian partners should develop standardised, secure protocols for sharing information, with tiered access levels allowing countries to participate based on their capabilities and trust levels. Building upon existing frameworks like the Quad to create a ‘Quad+’ network that includes key regional players such as South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia would enhance collaboration. Initial cooperation could focus on sharing maritime surveillance data and cyber threat intelligence, setting the foundation for expanding into more sensitive areas as trust builds. But significant obstacles remain. Many Asian countries lack adequate security infrastructure and the capacity for secure information handling, complicating the sharing of classified data. Indonesia suffered a major cybersecurity breach in May 2024 when hackers attacked its national data centre, disrupting critical public services and exposing vulnerabilities. Chinese hacking groups have targeted Southeast Asian government and military entities, seeking to steal intelligence related to South China Sea strategies. Taiwan faces extensive infiltration by Chinese intelligence, raising concerns about the security of shared information. The United States and its allies can provide technical support and training to enhance cybersecurity defences and information-handling protocols. This capacity-building approach not only facilitates intelligence sharing but also strengthens the overall security posture of partner nations. Enhancing intelligence-sharing frameworks rather than establishing a NATO-like military alliance represents a pragmatic path to regional security. By standardising protocols, expanding existing networks and building nations’ capacities to protect information, the Asia Pacific could bolster its security needs without exacerbating tensions or forcing countries to take sides. The future of Asia Pacific security depends not on adopting old structures, but on strategic cooperation that builds trust and tangibly enhances regional readiness and stability.

Malaysia Could Lose Western Investments Over Project With Chinese...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia could risk losing future investments in the technology sector if it aligns too closely with Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, which the United States and its allies have accused of espionage and intellectual property theft, analysts warn. Western firms could think Beijing has an unfair advantage in Kuala Lumpur’s growing tech market, said Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at regional consultant ADA Southeast Asia. Malaysia’s partnership with the U.S.-blacklisted Huawei to set up the country’s second 5G network 'could be perceived as favoring Chinese interests,' he said. 'The Malaysian government may consider Huawei’s partnership a pragmatic economic decision,' Asrul told BenarNews. 'However, Western investors might view this differently, especially since several countries, including the U.S., United Kingdom and Japan, have blacklisted the company and view it as a security threat.' In addition, the partnership with Huawei could trigger uncertainty among international investors, according to Farlina Said, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies Malaysia, a research think-tank. 'Considering Malaysia is in phases of strengthening the digital economy and some of the nation’s digital economy development plans come with international collaboration, [the project with Huawei] could create an environment of uncertainty,' she told BenarNews. Malaysia plays a significant role in the global technology and semiconductor supply chain, attracting more than U.S. $20 billion from tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle and Infineon over the last two years. Chinese company ByteDance, TikTok’s parent, also committed U.S. $350 million to expand its data center operations in Malaysia into a regional AI hub. Kuala Lumpur hopes that the multi-billion dollars of investments in the technology sector will create thousands of jobs in the country by 2030, according to the government. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim views a second 5G network as essential to meet surging broadband demand and attract more global investments amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission conducted a technical and commercial evaluation to choose a mobile network operator for the project, Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said last week. The decision to award U Mobile – Huawei’s local partner – complies with licensing conditions, he said. 'The factors for selection include contributions to projects [for rural telecommunication access], as well as performance on 4G upgrade initiatives.' The government also reviewed U Mobile’s business and technical plans, customer satisfaction record and prior performance on infrastructure projects, the minister said. U Mobile, backed by powerful stakeholders such as Malaysia’s king, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, defended itself from criticisms by pointing to its 17-year history in the sector and promising a cost-effective 5G rollout. Huawei’s communications team did not immediately respond to a BenarNews request for comment. Malaysia-China relations Previously, Anwar said Malaysia was committed to using Chinese technology in its tech infrastructure. 'We have adopted the policy of getting the Chinese technology, 5G, involved in the development of our country,' Anwar told Chinese President Xi Jinping during his four-day working visit to China last week, his third trip to the Asian superpower since being named prime minister in 2022. China has been Malaysia’s biggest trading partner since 2009. Bilateral trade between the two countries surged to over $117.5 billion in the first seven months of 2024, state news agency Bernama quoted Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Ouyang Yujing as saying. During his Beijing trip, Anwar also met with Huawei executives, discussing the company’s '5.5G' tech, cloud and artificial intelligence applications. Espionage concerns In May 2023, the U.S. and European Union issued a rare joint letter to the Malaysian government cautioning against Huawei’s involvement. A Financial Times report cited a leaked letter from former U.S. Ambassador Brian McFeeters warning that 'allowing untrusted suppliers in any part of the network also subjects Malaysia’s infrastructure to national security risks.' The U.S. has banned Huawei from its 5G networks and European countries have followed suit because of espionage concerns. Investigators determined Huawei equipment installed near U.S. military bases can intercept and disrupt sensitive defense communications, including those related to the oversight of the country’s nuclear deterrent, Reuters news service reported in July 2022. Ong Kian Ming, former deputy minister for International Trade and Industry, said the Malaysian government should have been more transparent in awarding the 5G contract to U Mobile. 'I do not think that having Huawei as the vendor for the second network is necessarily damaging for investor confidence, provided that: (i) the award of that contract is open and transparent and (ii) the [government company Digital Nasional Berhad which oversees Malaysia’s 5G network initiative] remains in place and is performing well,' Ong told BenarNews in a message. Second Trump term Meanwhile, a foreign affairs analyst said a second term for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could mean stricter policies toward Chinese technology abroad. 'Trump will have greater flexibility and pragmatism in handling China, which might not always be transactional in nature and can also be more direct and forceful,' said University of Malaya’s Collins Chong Yew Keat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVqO8JswWMgxc	2024-11-12T16:36:36-08:00	
What Are Republics, Exactly? It’s A Good Time To Learn – Analysis	Republican ideals have evolved over millennia, shaping governance across the globe. Modern republics continue to adapt, but face challenges in upholding their foundational principles. The 2024 U.S. presidential election was framed as a crucial test for the nation's political system, with ongoing concerns over oligarchy, mob rule, a breakdown of equal protection under the law, and the ultimate power of citizens to determine the fate of the nation. Republics have suffered total collapses throughout history, and there's no reason why the United States should be immune. The fear of that often prompts a superficial reference to the final fall of the Roman Republic or the end of Greek democracy. But there's a deeper history: Republics came into being far earlier in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean civilizations. And we can draw from a much wider range of examples to learn from as we try to understand the challenges and the opportunities. A true republic is a political system without monarchy or concentrated political power in any office, branch, or individual. Elected officials represent citizens to make decisions on their behalf, with separate branches of government providing checks and balances. While many associate republics with direct democracy in our times, there's a much wider array of power structures that developed in the formative era of republics. The 20th century established republics as the global standard, with monarchies declining after World War I and most former European colonies declaring independence as republics following World War II. Fascist and communist countries, which centralized power in individuals or ruling parties, also reduced in number. Despite their concentration of power, however, many fascist and communist states claimed the title of republics, and while 149 countries out of 193identify as republics today, far less uphold republican principles and blend them effectively with democracy. Examining the historical evolution of republics highlights those best positioned to serve as the most resilient modern examples. Republics require regular gatherings and assemblies, making them difficult to establish in sparsely populated agrarian societies, while empires generally concentrate power too heavily for self-rule to gain traction. It was in smaller city-states, particularly trade-focused ones, where citizens could form factions, exchange ideas, and influence government decisions and rules for commerce. Some of the earliest experiments with republican governance appeared in ancient Sumerian city-states (4500–2000 BC), centered in modern-day Iraq. Kings acted more as neutral arbitrators rather than rulers, sharing power with aristocratic families and groups, as well as common citizens. In Kish, citizens could appoint a new king during crises, while in Uruk, assemblies of townsmen and elders had to ratify major military decisions. The Sumerian city-states fell to the Akkadian and Babylonian Empires by 1750 BC, but Phoenician city-states, emerging about 250 years later in what is now Lebanon, revived republican ideals. Here, monarchical power was often shared with a merchant class and citizen council. Egyptian records dating to the mid-14th century BC describe Phoenician cities sending delegates to represent citizens rather than monarchs, with mentions of alliances and aid requests by the 'men of Arwad' and 'elders of Irqata.' By the 6th century BC, the Phoenician city of Tyre had functioned for seven years without a monarch, governed instead under suffetes, or judges, elected for short terms. In Chios, a 'people's council' allowed citizens to debate laws and hold officials accountable. However, beginning in the 9th century BC and continuing over the next few centuries, Phoenician city-states were successively conquered or subjugated by the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Macedonian Empires. Like other civilizations, Phoenicians established colonies and trading posts. Carthage, founded by Tyre in 814 BC in modern Tunisia, grew into a powerful city-state with its own republican features. By the early 7th century BC, two elected suffetes from aristocratic families replaced the monarchy. They governed alongside an aristocratic Senate, while newer merchants could gain influence and a popular assembly allowed citizens input on major decisions. Military and religious leaders also held considerable power. Republican ideals weren't confined to Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean. Buddhist texts like the Maha Parinibbana Sutta mention Indian republics called Gana-Sanghas in the 6th century BC. Some adopted republican styles of government, while others formed republican confederations, like Sumerian and Phoenician city-states, to make decisions collectively and protect against larger threats. The Indian republics were gradually absorbed by the Maurya Empire (321–185 BC) and other entities. Ancient Greek city-states also developed republican ideals. Sparta was governed by a constitution and popular assembly as early as 600 BC, though it remained largely monarchical. Athens established a direct democracy in 507 BC, known as demokratia, meaning 'people' and 'rule.' Greece's slave-based economy allowed some citizens time to participate in politics, though this limited political fairness. In 431 BC, Attica, the region surrounding Athens, had an estimated population of 315,000, of which only 172,000 were citizens, and just 40,000 male citizens could vote. Still, Athens's democratic system allowed these citizens to frequently debate, deliberate, and vote. They were overseen by the Council of Five Hundred, which was chosen annually by lot to draft laws and manage administration. However, following Athens's Golden Age, 4th century BC Greek critics likePlato and Aristotle, and later historians like Polybius in the 2nd century BC, criticized the system for inefficiency and vulnerability to charismatic leaders to sway public opinion, leading to volatile policy shifts. They emphasized balancing public, aristocracy, and monarchical roles to avoid the typical political cycle of chaos and order: first, a strong leader unites a restive society under a monarchy, which evolves into tyranny. It is overthrown and replaced by an aristocracy, which reduces into oligarchy. Democracy eventually replaces it but deteriorates into mob rule, restarting the cycle. Invasions further weakened Greece's republican and democratic systems, including in 338 BC, when Greece fell under the control of the Macedonian Empire, ending the independence of many city-states. Despite this, Greek states formed republican confederations to protect against threats, including the neighboring Roman Republic. The term republic derives from the Roman res publica, meaning 'public affairs,' emphasizing shared governance, civic participation, and checks and balances. Since its founding in 509 BC, the Roman Republic's political structure had evolved considerably. Polybius expressed appreciation for Rome's system, where two tribunes were elected annually to represent the common citizens, while two consuls were elected and held executive power, checked by an aristocratic senate. Romans were skeptical of Greek democracy, especially in Athens, due to its instability, infighting, and mob rule. Carthage's republic seemed overly commercial and lacked the civic loyalty the Romans valued. This loyalty was central to Rome's military, staffed by a citizen army motivated by shared rewards. In contrast, Carthage's strong, citizen-led navy protected trade routes, but its reliance on mercenaries for land campaigns made them costly and unpredictable. These factors reduced the ability to push back against Roman rule. By 146 BC, Rome defeated both Greece and Carthage, cementing its dominance and expanding political system. Polybius suggests that Rome's success over Carthage was partially due to its powerful, aristocratic Senate, while Carthage's policies were increasingly shaped by popular influence. He believed that Rome's decisions were made by elites versus the influence of the masses in Carthage. Yet by this time, Rome was approaching its Late Republic phase. The scholar Harriet Flower's research argues that the Roman Republic wasn't a single entity but a series of six republics, each with unique political characteristics. Others have also challenged the notion of a single Roman Republic, placing Republican Rome into three main periods characterized by changing centers of power. The Early Republic (509–367 BC) was marked by tensions between patricians (aristocratic elites) and plebeians (common citizens). The struggle for plebeian rights led to significant reforms, including the establishment of tribunes, elected by the Concilium Plebis to represent common interests, and often from the plebeian class. During the Middle Republic (367–133 BC), the Licinian-Sextian laws of 367 BC were passed to again alleviate tensions between patricians and plebeians, limiting patrician land ownership, providing debt relief for plebeians, and ensuring that at least one of the two consuls was a plebeian. However, political power increasingly concentrated in the Senate, undermining these reforms. During the Late Republic (133–31 BC), Rome's military success over rivals coincided with the growing influence of ordinary citizens in the judicial system, especially as jurors. Yet the republic was plagued by social conflict, corruption, and civil unrest. Sulla's march on Rome in 88 BC and his curtailing of the tribunes' power exemplified rising instability. After, figures like Pompey in the '70s BC and Julius Caesar in 59 BC began consolidating power, further undermining republican values. In 27 BC, Augustus formally transitioned Rome into an empire, while maintaining the illusion of republican traditions. Roman orator Cicero, a prominent defender of the Republic, inadvertently accelerated its demise through his support for Augustus, endorsement of dictatorial powers, and willingness to suspend legal norms during crises, showing the dangers of sacrificing republican ideals to manage turmoil. For the next few centuries, republican ideals were largely sidelined. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD saw feudalism and monarchies spread across its former territories and peripheral regions. This instability nonetheless allowed new republics to emerge, such as Venice, founded in 697 AD. It maintained a 1,100-year run as a republic through a political system that encouraged merchant participation and representation, shrewd diplomacy, social mobility, community cohesion, and an extensive trade network. It was eventually conquered by France in 1797. During the Italian Renaissance (14th to 17th centuries), urbanization, advancements in communication, and Enlightenment ideals enabled the rise of new city-states. Merchant classes and other groups established republican systems as alternatives to European monarchies elsewhere as well. However, they were ultimately absorbed by empires, partly due to their inability to exploit the expanding Atlantic trade routes that reduced the importance of the Mediterranean. Republics were not confined to Europe. The Kongsi Republics in modern-day Malaysia, particularly the Lanfang Republic declared in 1777, arose when Chinese settlers recruited by local sultans for mining formed companies to safeguard their interests. Over time, they evolved into self-governing territories with elected leaders and various levels of democratic governance. The Lanfang Republic was eventually defeated by Dutch colonial forces in 1884, with the rest absorbed through treaty or militarily defeated by the century's end. The establishment of the United States marked the reemergence of the large-scale republican state. In 1787, after the Revolutionary War, the U.S. formally became a constitutional republic, aiming to eliminate monarchy while avoiding a chaotic direct democracy. The Founding Fathers created a mixed system, balancing public participation with safeguards against aristocracy and emphasizing consent of the governed (though limited to white male landowners). The debates over constitutional amendments and expanding democracy continued for decades, paralleling similar discussions in post-Revolutionary France after 1789. Today, many republics exist, but their authenticity and stability can be compromised. Being conquered imposes outside authority, while others pursue foreign expansion themselves, centralizing control and subjugating other territories. Republics such as those in 16th century Netherlands, 17th century England, and 18th century U.S. and France grew into empires or reverted to monarchies, adapting in ways whose lessons are still relevant today. These expansionist policies, often justified as essential for wealth and security, led to the abandonment of certain republican and democratic principles. Republics can also shift toward authoritarianism, with modern policymakers perceiving more open democratic systems as unstable and vulnerable to manipulation. In recent years, China and Russia have seen reductions in public accountability, civil liberties, meaningful political participation, and concentrations of power behind Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. In North Korea, power has been concentrated in the leader's office since its founding, with leadership passed within the Kim family. Similarly, a dynasty has developed under the Aliyev family in Azerbaijan since the 1990s, with concerns that Turkmenistan may follow. Countries with strong presidential systems, common in the Americas, risk concentrating power in the executive branch. Fixed terms limit the removal of unpopular leaders, since, unlike in parliamentary democracies, no 'confidence vote' mechanism exists for crisis situations. Partisan loyalty can also weaken checks and balances, and coups can be common. Alliances and federations of Greek city-states like the Achaean and Lycian Leagues, as well as the Native American Iroquois Confederacy, formed assemblies and councils for representation and collective decision-making, influencing models like the U.S. Constitution and European Union (EU). The statement that the U.S. is 'a republic, not a democracy' reflects the original aim to keep political power within the states rather than the federal government. However, authority has increasingly centralized in Washington, D.C., reducing state sovereignty, tensions mirrored in the EU between individual states and Brussels. Political apathy and extremism can also stem from the influence of billionaires and corporations over the political process, government corruption, and the erosion of social mobility. Social media platforms offer the chance for heightened political participation, but are increasingly vulnerable to disinformation spread by big tech and political actors, revealing new ways in which democracies can veer toward mob rule. The diversity of republics today reflects their historical variety, with countries still navigating the governance structures in their own contexts. Kazakhstan, initially authoritarian, has seen some shift toward a more balanced systemwith a more powerful parliament following popular protests in 2022, though it remains less democratic. Similarly, Singapore, often described as authoritarian, is still considered a republic due to some checks and balances, maintaining a blend of controlled leadership and political structure. An informed and engaged citizenry, supported by a strong economic base, is essential for a successful republic. Citizens must feel the benefits of their system, and these must endure through fair elections, the rule of law, and due process. Effective foreign policy also relies on wide-ranging trade networks and adaptable alliances, while maintaining a strong military and avoiding military overreach or falling into the trap of foreign conquest. Historically, empire and monarchy have been more common than republics, shaping world order through hierarchical and anarchic systems. Within the global UN framework, which is designed to support the sovereignty and equality of nations (a principle rooted in republican ideals), republics can govern more democratically by collaborating in a way similar to ancient confederations. The Achaean League and Lycian League consisted of states with varying political systems cooperating within a loose, republican-style confederation. Modern blocs like the EU, ASEAN, and African Union allow countries to work together under common principles and boost their voice in the international system. Changes in domestic politics have meanwhile seen the growth of direct democracy in the 2010s, as more referendums and popular votes of legislative and constitutional issues emerged globally, but especially in Europe. While larger republics like the U.S., Germany, and India still avoid national-level votes on major issues, direct democracy is increasingly apparent at regional and local levels. Challenges remain in terms of deliberation and integration, as states like California and Arizona have seen ballot initiatives often rushed, leaving limited time for meaningful debate. Modern citizens' assemblies, based on those originating thousands of years ago, have also elevated these referendums in recent years and provided an alternative to traditional political processes. They have influenced major policy changes, such as climate policies in France to abortion laws in Ireland, with assemblies, typically convened by legislative bodies in partnership with nonprofits, designed to reflect demographics. While they have led to concrete policy shifts, some recommendations have not been adopted, with lawmakers citing the importance of expert-led decision-making. With the U.S. election behind us, reassessing republican ideals, both domestically and globally, is crucial. As the GOP potentially gains control over all three branches of government in a divided nation, how it implements policies will either ease concerns or amplify them. The future of republicanism depends on the U.S. shaping its domestic agenda for the common good and using its influence on the global stage in line with democratic principles.

Prabowo’s US-China Balancing Act – OpEd	Indonesia is on the rise. As ASEAN’s largest country and economy, with a growing domestic consumer market and a large supply of natural resources, its economic potential is clear. Sitting in the South China Sea surrounded by its fellow ASEAN nations and encircled by India, China, Japan, and Australia, it also commands great geopolitical importance. It is no wonder that over 30 ministers and world leaders attended President Prabowo Subianto’s recent inauguration. An ex-military general and oligarch, Prabowo is taking the reins on foreign policy, appointing his long-time follower Sugiono as foreign minister. This is not surprising. With his foreign education at The American School in London and knowledge of several languages, Prabowo is a natural statesman. As president-elect, he has already made visits to China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the Middle East, Europe and Australia, displaying a more active, centralized and personalized approach to foreign policy than his predecessor, Joko Widodo. But the difference in personality has not meant a difference in policy. Prabowo has reaffirmed Indonesia’s non-alignment stance and has committed himself to the same 'good-neighbour foreign policy' as Widodo did. However, Indonesia’s neutrality is under pressure as the competition between the United States and China intensifies and the world becomes more fragmented. The United States and its allies in Asia, notably the Philippines and Japan, expect Prabowo’s support in resisting China’s aggression in the South China Sea, where China continues incursions into Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. Global conflicts are also testing Indonesia’s non-alignment. The wedge between the pro-Palestinian Indonesia and the pro-Israeli United States over the war in Gaza has grown. There is clear cooperation between China, Russia, and North Korea in opposing the United States and NATO in Ukraine. Prabowo personally felt this divide when his plan for ending the war in Ukraine was denounced as 'Russian-made' by Ukrainian and European officials. Although he will not formally end the policy of non-alignment, Prabowo is aware that his ability to simultaneously maintain ties with the United States, China and their respective allies is at risk. If push comes to shove, which way will he lean? A Fragile Friendship: Prabowo and the U.S. Prabowo has a strained relationship with the United States. Despite studying there in his youth, he was banned from entering the United States until he became defense minister over his role in the invasion and occupation of East Timor during the Suharto regime. As dictator Suharto’s son-in-law, he ran the Kopassus, Indonesia’s special forces, which allegedly committed human rights abuses against activists in East Timor and Papua. Furthermore, Prabowo’s election represents a trend towards authoritarian nationalist populism after decades of democratic regression under Widodo and Bambang. His ex-military strongman persona and ties to Suharto lead scholars to believe that Prabowo represents a challenge to Indonesian democracy. Although the United States wants to increase collaboration with Indonesia to counteract China’s aggression in the South China Sea, Prabowo is a partner who may not represent basic U.S. values and principles—and Prabowo knows this. U.S.-Indonesia defense ties, however, have flourished. Indonesia and the United States announced a new defense cooperation agreement in 2023 and hold over 220 defense engagements annually, including Exercise Super Garuda Shield, which builds U.S.-Indonesia military interoperability and jungle warfare capabilities. To modernize the Indonesian military, Prabowo is looking to the United States for fighter aircraft upgrades and sales, such as the $14 billion sale of 36 advanced fighter jets in 2022 (although the United States may limit these, given Prabowo’s human rights record). There are other restrictions to the relationship. It is built around the joint rejection of China’s aggression in the South China Sea, which Indonesia has back-pedaled on following criticism from China. Being economically reliant on your biggest security threat is a tightrope to walk. An Increasing Dependency: Prabowo and China China has no qualms about Prabowo’s past or leadership. China is Indonesia’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $128 billion in 2023, over double that of the United States. China funded the $7.3 billion Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway through the Belt and Road Initiative and pledged a further $67 billion of investment in 2023. These investments are a combination of loans and exports rather than traditional foreign direct investment (FDI). Prabowo, given his pragmatism and bullish attitude to taking on debt, is looking to China for further investment. Indonesia pitched three major railway projects during a rail expo in Shanghai this June. Chinese businesses are making crucial FDI into Indonesia’s most forward-looking industries, with BYD planning a $1.3 billion plant to grow the Indonesia EV market and Xinyi Glass Holdings building a $11.5 billion quartz sand processing plant necessary for solar panel production. These deals, along with those from Chinese mining firms like Tsingshan, are crucial to Prabowo’s aim of increasing downstreaming projects in Indonesia’s lucrative commodities sector, especially in nickel mining where Indonesia has gained 40 percent of the global market share. China’s grip on Indonesian growth is tightening and Prabowo will look to China, not the United States, to reach his ambitious target of 8 percent annual GDP growth. Although it announced an economic partnership with Indonesia in 2023, the United States has fallen behind China on Indonesian economic ties.But Japan, too, is also competing with China in Indonesia. Japan is Indonesia’s second largest trading partner with a similar value of trade as the United States. After losing out on the Jakarta-Bandung railway project to China, Japan has leveraged its historical and cultural ties to Indonesia to increase its investment into rail modernization projects in Jakarta, Bogor,and Depok. In a 2023 economic agreement, Japan agreed to consider investment in geothermal and waste management plants in Muara Laboh and West Java. China is ahead of both the United States and Japan, but together they represent an economic alternative for Prabowo to consider. Prabowo’s Tough Choices China represents Indonesia’s largest security threat. Indonesia maintains it has 'no territorial dispute with China' in the South China Sea. However, China’s 'nine-dash line,' which denotes its territorial claim, overlaps with Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone near the Natuna Islands. China continues to send coast guard and fishing ships to patrol the area, in particular to the Tuna block where Indonesia is exploring an offshore natural gas opportunity. As recently as October 2024, the Indonesian navy had to turn away another Chinese coast guard ship. As defense minister, Prabowo had been building up new air and naval bases in the Natuna Islands, which host three Indonesianfrigates and corvettes. It is clear that Prabowo expects friction with China. Given his reputation for being tough on national security and his history of modernizing the military, any engagement with China will weaken his position. It is therefore confusing that Prabowo is also expanding Indonesia-China defense ties, with reports that Indonesia is looking to buy, of all things, coastal defense missiles from Beijing. However, this defense partnership remains underwhelming in the face of tensions in the South China Sea and Jakarta’s reliance on Western military training and education. Given these increasing security tensions with Beijing, Prabowo might consider reducing Indonesia’s economic dependency on China in favor of strengthened relations with the United States and Japan. But in the current environment, given Prabowo’s strongman personality and his ambitious economic targets, China is the closer and more valuable partner. Prabowo thinks that he can deter China in the Natuna Islands by building up military capabilities. The Indonesian public seems to agree, with surveys showing in the absence of neutrality they would lean towards China over the United States. Prabowo’s push to join the BRICS bloc also supports this. But if China were to step up its aggression, there is little doubt that Indonesia would choose security over economic ties and look toward the United States and its allies for support. If the U.S.-China rift enlarges, Prabowo may have to make that shift sooner than he thinks.

Russia, India Are Early Birds As Pax Americana Is Ending – OpEd	The working visit of Russia’s First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov to Mumbai and Delhi on November 11-12 has been in the cards for sometime. It assumes added interest today as, in a delightful coincidence, it overlaps with the beginning of the end of Pax Americana in international politics. Manturov, 55, is one of the brightest stars of the new generation of leaders in the Russian political firmament with a brilliant record as an economist and technocrat in the energy and military-industrial complex, two key sectors of the economy. President Vladimir Putin has entrusted him with responsibilities that go far beyond the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Industry, a position he held for 12 years until May 2024 when he was elevated as First Deputy Prime Minister. Manturov is now a familiar face at the high table when Putin takes meetings on Ukraine war, which shows he wears many hats. Manturov is the co-chairman of Russian-Indian joint commission, alongside External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. To be sure, Jaishankar will have wide-ranging discussions with Manturov. Who else Manturov is meeting in Delhi will be an indication of the stirrings in the air in the Russian-Indian cooperation. The timing of the visit is notable since the neoconservatives who dominated the Biden administration — Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA director William Burns, et al — are on their way out and a brave new world is taking shape in Washington, DC. The influential CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder, who was the US ambassador to Nato, succinctly captured the imminent power shift in DC when he wrote in Politico in the weekend, 'Trump won in a landslide. He helped Republicans take control of the Senate and may well help them keep the House (by the way, Republicans have flipped the House as well) — ensuring single-party control across all three branches of government. He can rightly claim a mandate to implement all the policies he touted… All the while, he’ll be shielded by a Supreme Court.' Of course, Ambassador Daalder is an acolyte of the 'rules-based order' and a firm believer in America’s manifest destiny to lead the world. He wrote in his column titled The end of Pax Americana: 'I also worry about what this means for the rest of the world. In his first term, Trump made clear he doesn’t buy into Washington’s global leadership role as his predecessors have done. He doesn’t believe in leading — he believes in winning… 'Moscow and Beijing have long chafed at Washington’s leadership, and for the past decade, they’ve sought to counter and undermine it. They may now get their wish. Trump isn’t interested in sustaining the Pax Americana in the ways his 14 predecessors were… The end of the Pax Americana will have profound consequences…The Pax Americana will officially end on Jan. 20, 2025, when the US inaugurates Donald J. Trump as its 47th president. The country and world will be very different because of it.' Suffice to say, we are getting a preview of this historic juncture. Although taking place in the conditions under sanctions, Manturov’s agenda of discussions in Delhi will have a futuristic dimension. The point is, while the sanctions against Russia may take some time to be scrapped, their cutting edge — the fanaticism and the sound and fury with which Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen applied that intrusive diplomatic tool to dictate other countries’ economic and military relations with Russia — may now become blunt, what with all signs already pointing toward a Russian-American engagement. The Indian side should be mindful of this transition in the power dynamic to accelerate the economic and military-technical cooperation with Russia with a medium and long-term perspective. This is one thing. Second, we are edging toward a conversation between Trump and Putin. Do not be surprised if they decide to meet at an early date. Historically speaking, there is nothing like summitry to energise political systems with top-down culture such as the US and Russia have. Suffice to say, we are nearing a point when the International Criminal Court which has an arrest warrant against Putin, won’t know where to hide itself. From our perspective, that opens the door leading to the rose garden for a state visit by Putin to India — perhaps, as the chief guest at the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the Indian Republic on January 26, 2025. Putin is a great friend of India’s. Only two days ago, he described India as unparalleled in the global arena and went on to say Russia is strengthening its relationship with India on multiple fronts, with a high level of trust underpinning their bilateral ties. Putin paid fulsome praise to India’s rise saying, 'India should undoubtedly be added to the list of superpowers, with its billion-and-a-half population, the fastest growth among all economies in the world, ancient culture, and very good prospects for further growth.' To be sure, India finds itself in a truly privileged position in the international political arena with the consolidation of the Indian-Russian partnership, with prospects opening up for a spurt to take the US-Indian ties to new heights taking advantage of Trump’s goodwill, and, indeed, with the nascent signs of a thaw appearing in the troubled Sino-Indian relationship — and, of course, as the fastest growing major economy in the world. India’s optimal aim should be to create synergy out of all three relationships running on parallel tracks — with Russia, US and China respectively. No matter the complexities of their mutual relationships, India should aspire for a confluence of the three streams for advancing its comprehensive national development. There is a whiff of hope in the air for a warming of bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington under Trump, which have been in a free fall. But Russophobia is deeply entrenched in the American elites and Russia will remain a toxic issue. Yet, Trump has repeatedly stressed good relations with Putin, as well as mutual respect. And Putin is a very talented politician who understands Trump. As for Russia-China relationship, Moscow and Beijing are at a high noon of partnership unparalleled in their history. That relationship is anchored in the great camaraderie between Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping, is rock solid and will remain so despite the fluidity in the international environment. Of course, there are misgivings about the trajectory of the US-China relationship going forward. But, here again, the crux of the matter is the US’ economic rivalry with China in the American mindset. Per se, China does not hold any threat to the US. Nor is China an expansionist power. Certainly, it is a stakeholder in a stable, predictable global environment where the all-important mission of creating wealth becomes sustainable uninterruptedly. And China, unlike Russia, does not even challenge American power, influence and interests directly or by design. This is the plain truth cutting through the shibboleths of self-serving narratives by China’s detractors. The point is, a military confrontation between the US and China will not happen under Trump’s watch. Neither side is interested in waging wars. Trump pledged this as a solemn promise in his victory speech on Wednesday. Besides, the Indo-Pacific strategy itself is floundering. The latest sign of it is that Indonesia, the largest country in Southeast Asia, is turning its back on US-led alliance systems. and seeks BRICS membership following the footfalls of Malaysia, another important ASEAN country. The presence of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Trump’s inner circle can be seen as a stabilising factor for US-China relations. Above all, only China can be a meaningful interlocutor to help Trump realise the ambitious MAGA project.

Will Spain’s New European Commissioner Be Telefonica’s Woman? – O...	By Natalia Hidalgo Martínez (EurActiv) -- Spain's Commissioner-designate for a Clean, Just, and Competitive Transition, Teresa Riberá, will be grilled by MEPs on Tuesday (12 November), and her views on telecoms market consolidation, in light of Telefonicá's influence on Spanish politics, could be a key issue. Many expect her to please her home country’s national champion, Telefonica. Spain does not have a digital policy; the charge goes; it has a Telefonica policy. And Telefonica’s interests are clear: as one of Europe’s three largest telecom companies, it will lead any consolidation. How to fix Europe’s struggling telecom companies has become one of Europe’s most vexing policy tussles. Many struggle to make money and invest in upgrading the continent’s digital infrastructure. They blame market fragmentation and rigid competition laws. The EU counts 34 mobile operators – compared to just four in China and three in the United States. If confirmed, Ribera faces this and other hefty challenges.She will have to decide whether to soften antitrust rules to allow for the creation of European champions while enforcing a crackdown on Big Tech. In addition to her new job policing tech competition, she is tasked with completing Europe’s Green Deal, an area she knows fairly well as Spain’s ecological transition minister and as an international climate negotiator. Born in 1969, Ribera grew up as the eldest of five children in a family of academics in a comfortable Madrid neighbourhood. Her mother was a philosophy professor and expert inKrausism, named after the German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, who advocates tolerance and academic freedom from dogma. Her father, a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine, was a promoter of modern geriatrics in Spain. A lover of hiking and reading, she earned her bachelor’s degree in constitutional law and political science from Universidad Complutense de Madrid. She became an associate professor at the department of public law and philosophy of law at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Mother of three daughters, she lives in the Spanish capital with her husband, Mariano Bacigalupo, an Argentine lawyer and board member of the Spanish national securities market commission. Ribera’s political rise began in 2005 when she became director of Spain’s climate change office, following different positions in the ministries of public work, transportation, and environment. In 2008, she was appointed secretary of state for climate change. 'She is a person of dialogue, who listens and knows how to be open to certain proposals,' praised the director of Greenpeace Spain, Eva Saldana. This year, Ribera was awarded the Progressive Person of the Year by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies. She participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement while directing the Paris-based think tank, the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations. Ribera has also been a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Advisory Council on Climate and Sustainable Development Solution Networks’ Global Leadership Council. 'She is really knowledgeable about all the questions surrounding sustainable development,' says Nicolas Berghmans, director of IDDRI’s new industrial policies program. 'I was always impressed by her ability to read the political landscape and find alliances.' As Spain’s Ecological Transition Minister for the past six years, Ribera oversaw the shutdown of Spain’s coal industry, negotiated a nuclear phase-out, and secured an exemption from EU electricity market rules for Spain and Portugal during the 2022 gas crisis. Spain pioneered setting a legal target to reach climate neutrality by 2050 – a goal the EU later adopted for the entire Union. In Brussels, she will be tasked with overcoming a backlash from farmers, consumers, and businesses fearful of high prices, and the impact on competitiveness. Navigating the job The role will require ideological flexibility. She already has been forced to make a U-turn on nuclear energy. The socialist Ribera once described the EU's decision to label it a sustainable investment as 'a huge mistake.' Nuclear-friendly countries led by France raised alarms. She now assures that she will not oppose nuclear power expansion in Europe. Ribera declined an interview request for this article. Ribera also will oversee EU antitrust enforcement. That is a powerful position, and her nomination generated strong opposition from the European People’s Party (EPP), which was reluctant to see a choice they described as 'too radical, too green.' The Spaniard replaces Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager, who ordered Apple to repay €13 billion in underreported taxes and earned Donald Trump’s epithet as a US-hating 'tax lady.' Vestager has warned that a sweeping overhaul of competition policy and merger rules to create European industrial champions could open a 'Pandora’s box.' Ribera has acknowledged Vestager’s contributions but suggested that change may be necessary, stating, 'Margarethe has done a great job, and we need to see to what extent this great job needs to evolve.' Ribera could renew the push for additional 'fair share' payments from US tech companies who account for much of the telcos' traffic. And she could allow the telephone companies to consolidate, despite the risk of higher prices.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVpBRA-3kjB8m	2024-11-12T16:31:05-08:00	
The Corrupt Nature Of DEI – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya Once it is averred that inequality is wrong and the government ought to do 'something' to make people more equal, tyranny is always around the corner. Equalization methods and strategies may vary, but some degree of coercion is guaranteed once it is decided to equalize human beings. The philosopher Antony Flew characterized egalitarianism as a procrustean ideal—some must be stretched to breaking point, while others must be cut down to size, in order to ensure that all are enjoying equal life opportunities. As David Gordon often reminds us, this is why Murray Rothbard regarded 'equality of opportunity' as an absurd and anti-human ideal. Egalitarian ideology currently marches under the banner of 'diversity, equity and inclusiveness.' Jordan Peterson refers to DEI as 'the great ideological lie,' and pointedly reverses the acronym from DEI to DIE to emphasize the inevitable outcome of diversity enforcement. Commenting on diversity policies in Canadian higher education, Peterson wrote: All my craven colleagues must craft DIE statements to obtain a research grant. They all lie (excepting the minority of true believers) and they teach their students to do the same. And they do it constantly, with various rationalizations and justifications, further corrupting what is already a stunningly corrupt enterprise. Some of my colleagues even allow themselves to undergo so-called anti-bias training, conducted by supremely unqualified Human Resources personnel, lecturing inanely and blithely and in an accusatory manner about theoretically all-pervasive racist/sexist/heterosexist attitudes. In the United States, Christopher Caldwell traces diversity policies to the Supreme Court interpretation of the Civil Rights Act 1964 in the case of Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). In his book Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties, he describes affirmative action as 'the main avenue through which civil rights law was changing the country’s public and private institutions.' Describing university programs that reserved a number of places for African Americans, Caldwell explains: 'That such programs discriminated, by reallocating opportunities from whites to blacks and other minorities, was obvious. It was their whole point.' It was not disputed at the time that these programs were discriminatory; the question was not whether they were discriminatory, but whether they were justified as a means of correcting inequality. Caldwell adds that, 'The justices were concerned with how the programs discriminated, and on what grounds.' Caldwell explains that the 'new definition of 'diversity' provided a rationale for four judges in Bakke who approved of this pro-black discrimination. These judges 'accepted Lyndon Johnson’s description of American society as a footrace to which one runner had arrived shackled—on that basis, they could countenance some infringement on whites’ individual rights in order to fix a society-deforming wrong.' Following from Bakke, diversity was thereafter depicted as the overarching goal of equal opportunities. Discrimination against white people was seen as nothing more than promoting diversity, and endorsed by the courts as a 'justified' means of achieving what many egalitarians describe as 'true equality.' Caldwell points out that although Bakke purported to distinguish between quotas (illegal) and 'diversity' (legal), the end result of diversity is precisely the same as using quotas: '[Justice Lewis] Powell’s opinion, in short, did not eliminate quotas. It just dressed them up as something else. It required all schools that used racial preferences to recast them as programs to promote their interest in the diversity of their student bodies.' Thus arose the hegemony of diversity, which was later reinforced by the concepts of inclusiveness and equity. Diversity as a legal obligation Caldwell further explains how the notion of 'diversity' upheld in Bakke not only justified discrimination against whites and in favor of minorities, but also came to be regarded by many institutions as an implicit legal obligation—in the sense that failing to promote diversity came to be seen as a breach of the equal opportunities obligations of the Civil Rights Act. Paradoxically, the use of critical race theory 'divisive concepts' and anti-white racism, both of which many people regard as a violation of the equal protection clause of the US constitution, came to be regarded as a positive legal obligation under civil rights law. This explains the shouting matches often observed between traditional supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment – those who believe in 'colorblind equality' and supporters of the Civil Rights Act who believe in DEI. The colorblind egalitarians insist that DEI is racially discriminatory against whites and therefore illegal, while the DEI egalitarians retort that banning DEI violates the Civil Rights Act by ignoring discrimination against blacks, and is therefore illegal. Both sides also invoke the First Amendment free speech protection to defend their position. From a Rothbardian perspective, both protagonists that are yelling 'that’s illegal!' at each other are lost (though arguably the DEI egalitarians are more woefully lost than the colorblind egalitarians) and the only workable solution would be to repeal both the Civil Rights Act, as Lew Rockwell has argued, and the FourteenthAmendment. This is the dispute currently unfolding in several states that have banned DEI in public schools and universities. In Alabama, for example, the University of Alabama guidance states: 'Following the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision, federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, and sex. On June 29, 2023, the Court ruled race conscious admissions programs used by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina were not legal in the cases Students for Fair Admissions (SSFA) v. Harvard and Fair Admissions v. North Carolina. In addition, the Alabama State Legislature passed, and Governor Kay Ivey signed into law, Senate Bill 129 (SB129),2 which defines and imposes limitations related to 'divisive concepts' as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs.' The guidance goes on to define the meaning of DEI programs, emphasizing that programs deemed to be 'necessary to comply' with other legal obligations are not DEI programs: 'Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs are defined as '[a]ny program, class, training, seminar, or other event where attendance is based on an individual’s race, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, or sexual orientation, or that otherwise violates [the law].' Under the law, programs, classes, trainings, seminars, or other events that are necessary to comply with applicable state law, federal law, court order, or accreditation requirements are NOT considered DEI programs.' The reference to 'other legal obligations' with which it is still necessary to comply includes things like civil rights obligations and Department of Education mandates. For example, the National Center for Education Statistics requires 'maintaining, collecting, and reporting racial and ethnic data to the U.S. Department of Education.' DEI bans do not affect these reporting obligations and it is likely that through statistical reporting on diversity the corrupt enterprise of DIE referred to by Jordan will continue its hegemony. Another reason why it may be premature to celebrate the end of DEI is that DEI bans are under attack from Democrat politicians who claim that banning DEI is a breach of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their argument is that providing equal protection to minority groups requires DEI programs, therefore banning DEI programs strips minorities of the equal protection encompassed in DEI. Hence institutions closing down their DEI offices are remaining cautious, aiming 'to review their workplace policies and training programs with respect to existing obligations under federal, state, and local laws, such as the anti discrimination requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and other civil rights statutes.' Some have also argued that banning DEI is potentially a breach of free speech, an interpretation upheld by courts in Florida in striking down parts of Florida’s 'Stop WOKE' law. Florida’s experience illustrates the cost hazards for states fighting against DEI. 'Florida could face paying nearly $750,000 in legal fees for businesses that successfully challenged part of a 2022 law that Gov. Ron DeSantis dubbed the 'Stop WOKE Act.' Citing what they called a 'resounding victory,' attorneys for the businesses filed a motion Friday seeking $749,642 in fees. Also, they sought $41,144 in additional costs related to the lengthy legal battle.' In addition to this unfolding lawfare, it should be noted that the Supreme Court in SFFA stated that 'nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.' Many academics committed to DEI have seized on this enthusiastically as a potentially rich vein to exploit in advancing their diversity ambitions. It is therefore clear that the fight against DEI is by no means over. In many ways, it is only just beginning. About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

Missed The Mark: Why Pollsters Misjudged The 2024 Election – OpEd	Most political pollsters were wrong about how close the 2024 U.S. presidential election would be, especially in so-called battleground states, which were expected to be toss-ups just days before November 5. Why did the polls underestimate Donald Trump’s popular vote margin wildly and, by extension, his dominance of the Electoral College? One answer is that public opinion polls, and surveys in general, are seriously flawed. Respondents to questions about their preferences for political candidates or policy outcomes are not asked to make real choices over real options. The cost of stating that candidate A hypothetically is preferred to candidate B essentially is zero. Nothing is sacrificed when the respondent opines one way rather than another or says that he or she is undecided. We also know that survey results depend on the precise wording of questions. Some are 'leading,' biased, or vague. Questioners’ body language, facial expressions, or vocal tones may influence respondents’ beliefs about acceptable answers during in-person or telephone surveys. Opinion surveys administered online raise challenges relating to sample sizes and participant self-selection. Polling failed miserably in the run-up to Election Day 2024. Pollsters and political pundits consistently misjudged the 'red wave' that swept the nation on November 5, missing the mark in the opposite direction from 2022’s midterm elections when broad Republican gains had been anticipated. Although political candidates and parties closely monitor pre-election polls, they are misleading at best and useless in practice. They are no more informative than the 'focus groups' and marketing surveys that produced commercial flops like the Edsel or New Coke. Even with sample sizes in the thousands rather than the millions, no one response to a survey determines a poll’s overall results. Error rates in most opinion polls typically amount to three percentage points in either direction. A vote cast in a mass democratic election also is unlikely to be decisive. As of this writing, more than 140 million voters turned out for 2024’s presidential race. Donald Trump outpolled Kamala Harris nationally by about four million popular votes. It is impossible to say which of those four million voters put Trump 'over the top.' The probability of one vote being decisive or pivotal in 2024 was vanishingly small (roughly one in 140 million). The late public-choice economist Gordon Tullock relied on such evidence to conclude that voting in mass democratic elections is irrational because the costs of voting (becoming informed about the candidates and issues on the ballot, traveling to and from the polls, or filling out and mailing a ballot) exceed the benefits of doing so for most voters, measured by the nearly zero chance of influencing the election’s outcome. For Tullock, the probability of one voter’s decisiveness on Election Day is smaller than the chance of being struck by lightning on the way to or from polling places or ballot drop boxes. However, Tullock also launched a research agenda concluding that voting is rational if seen as a low-cost way of expressing political preferences. Because one vote is not consequential, voters can support candidates or policies they would not support otherwise. Many voters would reject a policy that raises their annual tax bills by $10,000 if a single vote determined the outcome. But if the chance of being pivotal is one in 10,000 (0.0001)—much larger than one in 140 million—a vote in favor of the policy raises the voter’s expected tax bill by just $1 (= 0.0001 times $10,000). Even uncharitable people can afford to be charitable under such circumstances, supporting programs and policies they would reject if they faced the full cost of their choices. Close elections almost always trigger challenges by losers, ballot recounts, and other consequences that introduce uncertainty into voting processes. Such uncertainty makes it more difficult to conclude that one vote will 'matter' ahead of time. The point is that opinions expressed in response to political polls and decisions made in the voting booth differ substantially from ordinary market decisions, where costs and benefits are more closely aligned. Because they have skin in the game, people’s market choices do reveal their preferences. Thus, it should be no surprise that pollsters claiming to forecast hypothetical political preferences often get it wrong.

European Lackeys In Panic Mode As Trump Signals Detente With Russ...	It’s early days yet. However, there are signs that President-elect Trump is moving toward a detente with Russia over Ukraine. One good sign is that Trump will not invite Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley to join his cabinet when he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president on January 20. Both of these figures were rabid anti-Russia hawks during Trump’s previous administration. There were suggestions that Pompeo and Haley might return with senior posts in his second administration. But Trump has announced the pair will not be offered new positions. Another positive sign is from people close to Trump’s inner circle who are letting the Kiev regime know – rudely – that the U.S. military aid spigot is being turned off. Donald Trump has yet to hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Kremlin. But both leaders have already expressed a willingness to negotiate a peaceful settlement over the Ukraine conflict. Another promising sign of potential detente between the United States and Russia is the sheer panic among European leaders. The news of Trump’s election last week has caused most European elites to scramble like scared children on hearing 'boo!'. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron are consoling themselves by urging Europe to 'come together' in the wake of Trump’s stunning election victory. The collapse of Germany’s coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is an early casualty of the Trump impact. European leaders fear that if Trump pulls the plug on military aid to the Kiev regime they will be left holding the can to fund the proxy war against Russia, which the weak European economies have no chance of sustaining. It’s no secret that the main European states were betting on Democrat candidate Kamala Harris winning the race to the White House. Harris would have ensured the continuation of NATO’s backing for the Kiev regime. With Trump becoming president, all bets are off. The political price will be ruinous for European leaders who have invested huge political capital in waging war to 'defend Ukraine from Russian aggression.' Trump has shown skepticism toward that false narrative. He has told Europe to go it alone if it wants to. And the European Russophobes know they can’t do that. If Trump follows through on his election promise to negotiate with Putin on a settlement in Ukraine, then the Europeans are going to be left with serious amounts of egg on their faces. One thing about Trump that is of concern to the Europeans is his frustration with them as being, in his view, freeloaders on American protection. Another is Trump’s vindictive streak. He’s not going to forget that most of the European leaders wanted him to lose the election. Take Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer. His Labour Party sent volunteers over to the U.S. to advise Harris on winning the election. The British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has also been reminded that he previously disparaged Trump as a racist 'sociopath.' Trump’s election is bad news for Britain and there is no doubt that Starmer is now trying to repair post-Brexit relations with Europe as a hedge against the expected chill from Washington during the next four years. When Britain pulled out of the European Union after its 2016 Brexit referendum, there were high hopes that it could negotiate a special trade deal with the U.S. That deal didn’t work out and looks even less likely now. Hence, Starmer has been busy since taking office in Downing Street trying to restore relations with the EU. This week, the British leader attended the Armistice ceremony in Paris to commemorate the end of the First World War. The last time a British leader honored that event in Paris was in 1944 when Winston Churchill visited the French capital following its liberation from Nazi occupation. Macon invited Starmer to lay wreaths in the Champs-Elysee and the Arc de Triomphe. The choreographed caper of European unity is a reflection of the panic gripping European leaders in the aftermath of Trump’s return to the White House. But everything is up in the air for the European politicians. Starmer was bending over backward to renew relations with Germany as a way to forge a warmer connection between London and the European Union after years of post-Brexit bitterness, only for that to be thrown into doubt. Last month saw a landmark security deal between Britain and Germany in which German arms maker Rheinmetall would open a new factory in Britain, and the German Luftwaffe would be able to fly warplanes from an RAF base in Scotland. The deal was touted as 'a sign of joint European security in the face of Russian threat.' With the collapse of the government in Berlin over the unbearable financial costs of the Ukraine war to the German economy, the British security treaty may not materialize. That means a big setback to Starmer’s reset plans with Europe. Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Slovakia’s Robert Fico are in the minority of European politicians who genuinely welcomed Trump’s election as an opportunity to wind down the NATO proxy war in Ukraine against Russia. On the other hand, the ardent NATO warmongers in Europe, including Britain, Germany, France, Poland and the Baltic states now face a desperate dilemma. Along with EU leaders like Von der Leyen and the Dutch NATO chief Mark Rutte, they have all nailed their colors to the mast for continuing the reckless proxy war against Russia. Trump seems to be showing good sense in calling off that proxy war and finding a way to negotiate sensibly with Russia on detente. Moscow wants its long-term security demands to be met. That means no NATO membership for Ukraine, an end to the NeoNazi regime in Kiev, and recognition of its historical lands in Crimea and the Donbass. This is all eminently negotiable, and Trump might just be ready to cut a deal to avoid World War Three, as he has repeatedly indicated he would do. That would mean Trump dumping the false narrative that Biden, Harris and the Democrats – and their European vassals – contrived about 'defending Ukraine'. That would leave the European lackeys in a disastrous lurch. How will they explain to their electorates the three-year slaughter in Ukraine? How will they justify the tens of billions of Euros and Sterling wasted on pushing a war that not only destroyed millions of lives but their economies as well? The stupid European leaders are in panic mode, and that’s a good thing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVtefpb4p6OU0	2024-11-12T16:19:25-08:00	
This Time, Trump’s Win Is Not An Oddity: It Is The American Reali...	By Yossi Mekelberg It is not only Donald Trump’s election victory that has sent shockwaves across the US and many parts of the world, but also its decisiveness, which defied all forecasts of a close race. If Trump’s first victory in 2016 felt like a fluke, benefiting from a combination of him being a political novice but with star qualities as a multimillionaire businessman and a well-known reality TV presenter, this time he was elected, and by a big margin, for who he is. Make no mistake, the margin of Trump’s victory and the Republicans’ control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate should not conceal the depth of the divisions within American society. This is a feature that will dominate the US for the foreseeable future. And for a stunned Democratic Party, there is an uphill battle, first to come to terms with defeat, but more significantly to reconnect with those who are its natural electorate yet have been swayed by Trump. A quick glimpse of the distribution of votes across the US shows that most of this vast territory has been painted red, emphasizing that the party representing leftist-liberal progressive ideas and values has lost the working class, who should be its backbone. These are mainly white men who are angry at seeing their jobs disappearing abroad and who feel marginalized. Trump is appealing to them. Trump is not a Republican in the traditional sense and not even strictly a politician. Democrats cannot exonerate themselves from having no answer to Trump. It became apparent that the economy played a significant role in voters’ preferences and the increase in the cost of living over the last four years has cost them dearly. Anyone who visits a grocery store in the US will be astonished by how expensive fresh produce is in comparison to most other countries of similar economic development. Raw figures about employment or economic growth matter very little in many parts of the country when earnings do not allow a decent standard of living and when the younger generations do not enjoy a similar degree of prosperity to that enjoyed by their parents. It was those who have a job — who are sometimes forced to take two or three jobs and who feel stuck in survival mode with no way out — that painted much of the US red last week. Whenever this mood prevails, it is usually those in power who are punished by the voters and Kamala Harris is the vice president. It was not only the economy that decided last week’s election, but immigration too. The debate over this divisive issue has been hijacked by the populist right and, interestingly, even Latinos voted for Trump in big numbers. There is an interesting phenomenon operating here: those who are legal migrants begrudge the undocumented ones, whom they perceive as skipping the hard work they had to do to earn their status. Moreover, they perceive illegal migration from Latin America as the main reason they are disparaged by others in US society and face a more difficult path to social acceptance. Yet the Biden administration and Harris in particular, who was in charge of securing the borders, did very little to stop illegal migration. Trump’s appeal to just over half of the American people is a mystery to the rest of the nation and to many around the world. However, he rides his status with pride and has appealed to enough voters. For the Democrats, this should be the beginning of a period of soul-searching: how do they reconnect with their electoral and ideological roots? If their position on the economy and migration put them in an inferior position, their inability to bring an end to the war in Gaza also cost them votes in certain parts of the country. However, it was their pushing too hard and too fast for some aspects of their progressive agenda that made some voters uncomfortable and left them feeling that an elite was trying to force upon them changes that clashed with their traditional values. This is not to suggest that these progressive ideas are wrong as such, the opposite is often the case, but they cannot be enforced from the top down and by patronizing those who object to them. Instead, they should engage with people and allay their fears. What’s more, it should not be forgotten that, while Trump won the Republican primaries easily and had months to build his campaign, Harris won her party’s nomination almost by default when it became apparent that President Joe Biden was not fit to run for another term. Going through the grinding process of the primaries gains the winner credibility, legitimacy, better engagement with the public and the momentum for a presidential campaign. But the result of last Tuesday’s election made it clear that Harris had too little time to lift the campaign and build trust, as well as being too closely associated with the Biden administration as his second in command. For the second time in eight years, we are once more entering the territory of the unknown and the unpredictable. Trump won this election fairly and squarely and there will not be a repeat of the ugly scenes of Jan. 6, 2021, but an orderly and civilized transition of power, as we should expect. Nevertheless, there will be many Americans, along with many in the international community, who will be deeply skeptical.

Trump Regime: Southeast Asia’s Options – OpEd	As Trump Returns to Power, Allies and Adversaries Expect a Wave of Revenge' -- New York Times Donald Trump's presidential victory has generated a frenzy of commentary on global geopolitics and geoeconomics unlike any previous election. For a start, leaders critical or contemptuous of Trump have had not only to swallow their pride. Many have now publicly retracted their earlier opinions and started to eat crow. Possibly the most striking example is Australia’s former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, currently Australia’s Ambassador to the United States. In 2020, Rudd condemned Trump as the 'most destructive president in history,' while in 2022 he denounced Trump as a 'traitor to the West' for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. Immediately after Trump’s victory, Rudd purged his personal and social media accounts of his anti-Trump posts - an action which Peter Dutton, Australia’s opposition leader responded to by predicting that Rudd would follow up with further attempts to ingratiate himself with the new government. 'He’ll be down at the tie shop, he’d be buying up red ties, he’d be buying red hats, he’ll be ordering those MAGA hats. He will do everything he can to ingratiate himself with the Trump campaign. So he’s indefatigable, as we know.' None of the leaders in the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) are likely to engage in the brown nosing and submissive behaviour that we are seeing from allies of the US - including from the Asian Pacific region - in their efforts to apple-polish Trump and his incoming administration, and to curry favour. What Southeast Asians Really Think of the US Not only is there no need for ASEAN leaders to buy MAGA merchandise especially submarines and missile systems or to ingratiate themselves further with the new US president, there is every reason we can expect ASEAN member countries and leaders to uphold the organisation’s independent and non aligned principles in the tumultuous era that lies ahead. An important marker for ASEAN’s foreign policy stance for the next four years has already been established by Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim. While congratulating Trump on his remarkable comeback victory, Anwar expressed the hope that Trump’s victory would bring positive changes in geopolitics, particularly to end the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. 'We will welcome any positive stance by the United States towards peace, particularly efforts to halt Israel's violent attacks on Gaza and to acknowledge the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.' This call by Malaysia as the incoming chair of ASEAN in 2025 for the new US administration to change its war-oriented ideological position pursued by the Biden administration, and presently playing out in respect to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and elsewhere where earlier presidents have sought to reinforce American dominance, should not be regarded as unrealistic or futile. Although criticised by western liberal media and think-tanks for his unpredictable ways and combustible foreign policy, Trump previously undertook an unprecedented peace initiative in dealing with North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. During his recent campaign Trump repeatedly promised to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. It is equally possible that he will do the same in Gaza if there is strong and sustained pressure from his western allies and the rest of the world. Standing up for ASEAN’s core principles means standing up for regional peace and security. This is a position which Trump, even if he disagrees with it, can and should be willing to live with. Despite his election rhetoric of making America great again, he is ultimately a businessman and realist with bigger concerns and issues to deal with in the United States, America, Europe, the Middle East and China. Draining the deep state and Capital Hill swamp may be his biggest challenge. This means that ASEAN will be relatively low and unimportant in his agenda. At the same time the reality for Trump’s hawkish foreign policy advisers is that ASEAN is a regional force that needs to be given due respect. With a larger population than North America’s, ASEAN is a middle level power in geopolitics but one of the world’s most diverse, fastest growing and competitive economic regions. The combined gross domestic product of US$3.8 trillion makes ASEAN the fifth largest economy in the world. During the period 2013-2022, ASEAN’s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.2% and is expected to grow just as or more strongly in the coming decade. Should Trump want a stronger counterweight to China, his team will be out to solicit for ASEAN’s support. The reality is also that should Trump want to restore the US to a more respectable standing in this part of the world, he has to begin with the recognition that many in ASEAN - possibly the great majority of the population - do not see the US as a role model for democracy, freedom, human rights and a force for peace. This representation is regarded by most people - including Americans - as a hollow claim though ceaselessly propagandised by the military-industrial-media complex. The prevailing dark view of the US in Southeast Asia is not only because of the recent history of its military campaign in Vietnam which spilled over into Laos and Cambodia and killed more than a million of the Indochinese population. It is also due to the US’s war record in the Middle East and elsewhere and its support of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza which has adversely affected Muslim as well as other non-western opinions of the US. Alignment Preference of Southeast Asians With regard to China which the Biden administration assessed as America's greatest geopolitical and geoeconomic rival, a recent survey of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute found that over half of Southeast Asians preferred alignment with China over the US. Its polling sample included respondents from the public and private sector, and researchers and academics who are in a position to influence policy. If the poll numbers from the Philippines, the most pro-American among ASEAN nations because of its history and the large population of Filipinos with relatives in the US or dependent for their livelihood on US military bases in the Philippines, are discounted, the finding would be more lopsided in favour of China. Policy advisers of President Trump will do well to point out to him that more than 40% of the population of Southeast Asia is Muslim. The way for Trump to make America better - great is in many ways a hopeless ambition - is to focus on dealing with the domestic issues that divide US society. It is not to engage in efforts to enforce the primacy of a nation whose preeminent standing in the world has been irretrievably lost. Trump’s exclusion of Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo, well known war hawks, in his new administration is a hopeful sign that he may, against all expectations, help build a peace-oriented road for the US in its foreign policy to embellish his place in history.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVuG26cpUQSMP	2024-11-12T16:10:56-08:00	
The Two-Trillion-Dollar Challenge – OpEd	There is an old proverb known as the 'law of holes.' It goes something like this: 'Let me tell you about the law of holes: If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.' This particular version of the proverb was coined by Bill Brock while serving as President Reagan’s Secretary of Labor. It matters today because it applies to the poor fiscal state in which the U.S. government finds itself. It’s no secret that the U.S. government’s fiscal situation has deteriorated since 2000. During the last four years, that fiscal deterioration sped up for the worse. U.S. politicians and bureaucrats have dug into a deep hole because of excessive spending. This spending directly contributed to 2021’s inflation surge, which subsequently led to 2024’s explosion in the U.S. government’s cost of borrowing. How to stop digging The outcome of the 2024 elections offers the potential to deliver a change in fiscal direction. Washington D.C.’s incoming leadership acknowledges the need to address the nation’s growing fiscal crisis. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s call for 'at least' $2 trillion in cuts to federal spending is drawing skepticism from experts as the billionaire tech magnate cements himself as one of former President Trump’s most prominent backers. 'How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted, $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget?' Howard Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO and Trump’s transition team co-chair, asked Musk at the former president’s recent rally held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Without offering specifics, Musk said in response that he thinks 'at least $2 trillion' in a brief moment that has since gained widespread attention online and drawn mixed reactions from budget world. Although the size of the figure draws skepticism, Musk’s two-trillion-dollar spending reduction target is typical of his 'set a big goal then go after it' business philosophy. To be sure, it will be opposed by many Washington D.C. institutions that will work hard to make it impossible to achieve. That is not a bad thing because achieving any significant portion of the target against that self-serving opposition can deliver at least one positive outcome. Writing at Reason, Veronique de Rugy describes how U.S. politicians and bureaucrats can rediscover a key principle of good governance: The best way to cut $2 trillion out of the budget is to ax everything the federal government does that it shouldn’t be doing in the first place. It’s time we rediscovered the exercise of thinking critically about government and the role it should or shouldn’t play in our lives. Questions like, 'Is that the role of government?' or 'Should the federal government pay for that?' haven’t been seriously considered in years. The muscle of fighting for first principles has atrophied among Republicans as it’s no longer in style to call for small government…. Cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget should be easy. Of course, it will be anything but, given Congress’ continued lack of interest in discussing spending cuts and the president’s sorry track record. If anything, let’s hope this Musk-led effort to cut spending will hopefully reintroduce seemingly forgotten rationales for cutting the federal budget. There is a related proverb that applies here, called Stein’s Law: 'If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.' The deep fiscal hole Washington D.C.’s players have dug through their excessive spending cannot continue forever. Certainly not as has been allowed during the past four years. Setting a $2 trillion target for spending cuts and working to make them happen is a means to stop digging the nation’s fiscal hole deeper at the speed they have been. It is both common sense and long overdue. This article was published by The Beacon	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVhuMFkiHKqM3	2024-11-12T16:08:05-08:00	
How Gov. Gavin Newsom And Jerry Brown Disenfranchised California ...	On election days, voters become public officials, and on November 5th Californians made the most of the opportunity by, as it now appears, rejecting Proposition 5 and passing Proposition 36. While they celebrate those victories, the people might recall a greater loss. Proposition 5 was an attack on the 'People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation,' the famous Proposition 13 from 1978, when some Californians were literally being taxed out of their homes. Proposition 5 would have reduced the two-thirds vote to pass bonds to 55 percent, making property tax hikes more likely. Proposition 36 aimed to restore the damage from the 2014 Proposition 47, which reduced some felonies to misdemeanors. The 'Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,' so named by state attorney general Kamala Harris, looked the other way at theft of property valued at less than $950. The measure launched a wave of shoplifting and vandalism that continues to this day. As Katy Grimes of the California Globe notes, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats had 10 years to deal with escalating crime, but failed to do so until Proposition 36 qualified for the November ballot. Another key measure qualified for the same ballot, but voters did not get the chance to make the call. California’s Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act required voter approval for all new taxes passed by the legislature and two-thirds voter approval for all new special tax increases. The act required that before any tax or fee is enacted, politicians must clearly outline how revenues would be spent. The measure gathered nearly one million signatures and qualified for the November 5 ballot. That disturbed Gov. Gavin Newsom and former governor Jerry Brown. Gov. Newsom contended that the measure is a constitutional revision, rather than a constitutional amendment, and would 'effectively block the state’s ability to quickly respond to major challenges.' Proponents of the measure charged that Newsom was simply attempting to disenfranchise the voters. Brown’s amicus brief made the same argument as Gov. Newsom, that the measure was a constitutional 'revision' rather than an amendment, basically a distinction without a difference. The former governor mentions Proposition 13, which Brown loudly opposed until it passed in a landslide. The state supreme court ruled that Proposition 13 'was both modest and does not change our basic governmental plan.' According to Brown, a Yale law alum, the Taxpayer Protection and Accountability Act, 'turns our governmental plan inside out.' If taxpayers thought that was exactly what the state needs it would be hard to blame them. Consider the government’s ongoing plan to keep income and sales taxes among the highest in the nation. Unfortunately, the state’s high court sided with the ruling class, booting the Taxpayer Protection Act from the ballot. On the other hand, the people scored victories by, as it now appears, rejecting Proposition 5, rejecting Proposition 33, (rent control), and passing Proposition 36.In Santa Ana, yet another victory escaped notice. By a 62-38 margin, voters rejected Measure DD, which would have allowed non-citizens to vote. Non-citizens voting is like an imposter replacing an elected official and, say, casting a vote to increase taxes. Those who support non-citizen voting, regardless of party affiliation, have no claim to support the rule of law. Proposition 13 made California a national leader but a reactionary ruling class now bars the people from curtailing tax and fee hikes. To restore national leadership and respect the rights of the people, the state should put the Taxpayer Protection Act on the next ballot, along with a measure to ban non-citizen voting statewide.

The Case For Stopping Russia Sanction-Busters – Analysis	By Stephen J. Blank and Mark Temnycky (FPRI) -- When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the international community quickly came together to condemn the aggressor. United Nations resolutions denounced the military incursion. Over 100 countries across the globe have consistently spoken out against the Russian war since it began, but many of them are violating the Western sanctions on the Kremlin, buying Russian energy resources, and selling goods and services. Still, the international community did not just talk—it imposed stiff penalties on Russia. The Russian Federation was expelled from the Council of Europe and suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council. Furthermore, several Russian companies, government officials, and oligarchs were sanctioned. Several politicians and oligarchs also had their assets frozen or seized. Finally, numerous countries have banned exports to Russia, reduced Russian gas imports, and reduced or ended their business relationships with Russia. Numerous Russian banks were removed from SWIFT, the global monetary banking system. As a result, the Russian Federation has lost billions of dollars, and the Russian economy has been under significant strain. Yet, these losses were not enough to end the war. Russia can still sustain its war machine, even paying for North Korean troops to assist with the fighting. This is because multiple companies and banks are undermining the impact of international sanctions on Russia. The European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western actors maintain normal trade relations with most neutral countries across the globe. This has created an opening for Russia as some countries in South America, Africa, and Asia serve as third-party intermediaries, re-exporting Western goods and services to Russia. Many restricted goods, including dual-use items and other forms of equipment, are being sent to Russia from these countries, providing Russia with the material and equipment it needs to continue its invasion of Ukraine. To streamline this process, Russia uses intermediaries to sell its crude oil, which ends up in gas tanks everywhere including the United States. Countries like India, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates purchase oil from the Russian Federation. This information is publicly available. Companies such as India’s Reliance Industries, Turkey’s STAR Refinery and Tupras Refinery, and the UAE’s Amur Trading FZCO import Russian crude that is then blended with other crudes at purchaser oil refineries. The mixed substance is refined into gasoline and sold worldwide, allowing Moscow to profit. All of this would be impossible without a sophisticated system of financial facilitation. Banks from former USSR countries—still heavily dependent on Russia in everything from energy supplies to security—are natural suspects. For example, when the full-scale invasion began, financial institutions such as Kazakhstan’s Kazpochta, Uzbekistan’s Kapital Bank, Kyrgyzstan’s Kompanyon Bank and MBank, and Armenia’s Ardshinbank continued doing business with Russia, primarily through the Russian money-transfer company Unistream. These financial institutions suspended their operations with Unistream after the United States imposed sanctions on the currency transfer company in July 2023. Not all have heeded warnings about sanctions. For example, banks in Kyrgyzstan, which is heavily dependent on Moscow, continued their business openly with the Russian Federation until this past summer when additional sanctions announced by the Biden administration persuaded a number of them to finally announce that they would be cutting ties with Russia. When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Kyrgyzstan mysteriously increased its trade relations with Western entities. At the same time, international financial transactions from Kyrgyzstan to Russia also increased. Current reporting indicates that Kyrgyzstan may still be involved in sanctions evasion. This includes dual-use goods, vehicle parts, and other equipment from China used by the Russian military for its invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, recent reporting indicates that Kyrgyzstan continues to help keep Russia’s energy sector going. For example, reporting on September 30, 2024, Euronews quoted Irina Tsukerman, president of Scarab Rising, a security strategy advisory firm, 'Russia is managing its energy exports, primarily oil and gas in various forms, using Kyrgyzstan as an effective trade hub to circumvent sanctions and get the fossil fuels into Europe.' One of the banks suspected to be involved in facilitating business with Russia is Kyrgyz MBank, which reportedly belongs to the country’s former Prime Minister Ömürbek Babanov. This bank was reported as receiving payments from buyers of Russian oil and partnering with Russian banking organizations such as Sberbank, which has been sanctioned by the US and the EU. The bank has also been working with the Russian card processing center Kartstandard, part of the Center of Financial Technologies (CFT), which was sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August 2024. MBank finally announced that it had suspended direct transactions with Sberbank and other sanctioned Russian entities only in mid-August 2024. However, the flows of payments were fully restored in less than a week with the help of intermediaries. MBank is reportedly working with one of Sberbank’s trusted intermediaries, Bank 131. Sberbank advises its clients that it makes payments to MBank and brags on its official website that wires could be made to any bank in Kyrgyzstan. South Korean Kookmin Bank, one of the key correspondent banks for Central Asian financial institutions, has decided to cease dollar SWIFT transfers with MBank, along with 20 other regional banks suspected of facilitating Russia’s sanctions evasion. However, it is estimated that at least five other international correspondent banks, including Pasha Yatirim Bankasi in Turkey, Mashreqbank in the UAE, and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Germany, continue to work with Kyrgyzstan despite the reputational and legal risks. MBank and four of its corresponding international banks have been contacted to comment on this article but failed to respond at the time of the publication. Landesbank, in an emailed response, declined to comment citing 'banking secrecy' but insisted it 'consistently complies with all applicable regulations.' In the context of sanction-busting business schemes, Central Asian banks like MBank are obviously just small fry. Extending secondary sanctions to those working directly with Russia is essential but may prove insufficient. For Western sanctions to have a real impact, they will need to increase pressure on the larger international partners of these smaller banks and firms and take additional measures to prevent financial facilitation of Putin’s war machine. MBank is not the only institution undermining these sanctions. In fact, OFAC recently announced new sanctions on prominent organizations that are helping Russia undermine international sanctions. The listincludes companies from countries such as India, China, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkey. Sanctioning these businesses will put additional pressure on their decision to aid Russia, and this will help bring a quicker end to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. In other words, Western collective action is the only way to impose real economic costs on Russia and, thereby, make progress toward ending the Russian invasion and restoring international order.

The Very Definition Of Tyranny: A Dictatorship Disguised As Democ...	Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Unadulterated power in any branch of government is a menace to freedom, but concentrated power across all three branches is the very definition of tyranny: a dictatorship disguised as democracy. When one party dominates all three branches of government—the executive, the legislative, and the judicial—there is even more reason to worry. There’s no point debating which political party would be more dangerous with these powers. This is true no matter which party is in power. This is particularly true in the wake of the 2024 election. Already, Donald Trump, who promised to be a dictator on 'day one,' is advancing plans to further undermine the nation’s already vulnerable system of checks and balances. To be fair, this is not a state of affairs that can be blamed exclusively on Trump. America’s founders intended our system of checks and balances to serve as a bulwark against centralized power being abused. As constitutional scholar Linda Monk explains, 'Within the separation of powers, each of the three branches of government has ‘checks and balances’ over the other two. For instance, Congress makes the laws, but the President can veto them, and the Supreme Court can declare them unconstitutional. The President enforces the law, but Congress must approve executive appointments and the Supreme Court rules whether executive action is constitutional. The Supreme Court can strike down actions by both the legislative and executive branches, but the President nominates Supreme Court justices, and the Senate confirms or denies their nominations.' Unfortunately, our system of checks and balances has been strained to the breaking point for years now, helped along by those across the political spectrum who, in marching in lockstep with the Deep State, have conspired to advance the government’s agenda at the expense of the citizenry’s constitutional rights. By 'government,' I’m not referring to the farce that is the highly partisan, two-party, bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. Rather, I’m referring to 'government' with a capital 'G,' the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law. This is exactly the kind of concentrated, absolute power the founders attempted to guard against by establishing a system of checks of balances that separate and shares power between three co-equal branches. Yet as law professor William P. Marshall concludes, 'The system of checks and balances that the Framers envisioned now lacks effective checks and is no longer in balance. The implications of this are serious. The Framers designed a system of separation of powers to combat government excess and abuse and to curb incompetence. They also believed that, in the absence of an effective separation-of-powers structure, such ills would inevitably follow. Unfortunately, however, power once taken is not easily surrendered.' The outcome of the 2024 elections is not a revolutionary bid to recalibrate a government run amok. Rather, this is a Deep State coup to stay in power, and Donald Trump is the vehicle by which it will do so. Watch and see. Remember, it was the Trump Administration that asked Congress to allow it to suspend parts of the Constitution whenever it deemed it necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic and 'other' emergencies. In fact, during Trump’s first term, the Department of Justice quietly trotted out and tested a long laundry list of terrifying powers to override the Constitution. We’re talking about lockdown powers (at both the federal and state level): the ability to suspend the Constitution, indefinitely detain American citizens, bypass the courts, quarantine whole communities or segments of the population, override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people, shut down entire industries and manipulate the economy, muzzle dissidents, 'stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease,' reshape financial markets, create a digital currency (and thus further restrict the use of cash), determine who should live or die… Bear in mind, however, that these powers the Trump Administration, acting on orders from the police state, officially asked Congress to recognize and authorize barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has unilaterally claimed for itself. Unofficially, the police state has been riding roughshod over the rule of law for years now without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs by Congress, the courts, the president, or the citizenry. This is why the Constitution’s system of checks and balances is so critical. Those who wrote our Constitution sought to ensure our freedoms by creating a document that protects our God-given rights at all times, even when we are engaged in war, whether that is a so-called war on terrorism, a so-called war on drugs, a so-called war on illegal immigration, or a so-called war on disease. The attempts by each successive presidential administration to rule by fiat merely plays into the hands of those who would distort the government’s system of checks and balances and its constitutional separation of powers beyond all recognition. In this way, we have arrived at the dystopian future depicted in the film V for Vendetta, which is no future at all. Set in the year 2020, V for Vendetta (written and produced by the Wachowskis) provides an eerie glimpse into a parallel universe in which a totalitarian government that knows all, sees all, controls everything, and promises safety and security above all comes to power by capitalizing on the people’s fear. Concentration camps (jails, private prisons and detention facilities) are established to house political prisoners and others deemed to be enemies of the state. Executions of undesirables (extremists, troublemakers and the like) are common, while other enemies of the state are made to 'disappear.' Populist uprisings and protests are met with extreme force. The television networks are controlled by the government with the purpose of perpetuating the regime. And most of the population is hooked into an entertainment mode and are clueless. In V for Vendetta, as in my novel The Erik Blair Diaries, the subtext is that authoritarian regimes—through a vicious cycle of manipulation, oppression and fear-mongering—foment violence, manufacture crises, and breed terrorists, thereby giving rise to a recurring cycle of blowback and violence. Only when the government itself becomes synonymous with the terrorism wreaking havoc in their lives do the people to finally mobilize and stand up to the government’s tyranny. V, a bold, charismatic freedom fighter, urges the British people to rise up and resist the government. In Vendetta, V the film’s masked crusader blows up the seat of government on November 5, Guy Fawkes Day, ironically enough the same day that Trump won his landslide return to the White House. Yet there the comparison ends. So, while we are overdue for a systemic check on the government’s overreaches and power grabs, this year’s electoral victory for Republicans was no win for the Constitution. Rather, it was a win for the very entrenched, hawkish, establishment power structure that has exhibited no regard for the Constitution or the rights of the citizenry. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, the Deep State works best through imperial presidents—empowered to indulge their authoritarian tendencies by legalistic courts, corrupt legislatures and a disinterested, distracted populace—who rule by fiat rather than by the rule of law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVvbeQt8OzNL8	2024-11-12T15:47:54-08:00	
North Korea Approves Deal With Moscow That Allows Troop Deploymen...	(RFE/RL) -- North Korea has ratified a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' agreement with Russia, cementing a deal that has paved the way for its soldiers to fight on Russian soil against Ukraine. North Korea's state-controlled news agency KCNA said on November 12 that the deal, which was agreed between Moscow and Pyongyang in June, will take full effect once both sides exchange ratified copies of the agreement. According to reports from South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin has already signed the documents.The deployment of North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which has been confirmed by U.S., NATO, South Korean, and Ukrainian intelligence, has raised concerns that it will further destabilize the Asia-Pacific region and broaden Moscow's war on Ukraine. South Korea has raised questions about what new military technologies North Korea might get from Russia in exchange for supplying troops. 'Russia working together with North Korea, Iran, and China is not only threatening Europe, it's threatening peace and security, yes, here in Europe, but also in the Indo-Pacific and in North America,' NATO Chief Mark Rutte said in Paris on November 12 ahead of talks later in the day with French President Emmanuel Macron. Russia has had to shift some resources to the Kursk border region to respond to a Ukrainian incursion launched in August, and its forces have struggled to push back Ukrainian troops there. The United States has estimated about 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia now. Seoul and its allies assess that the number has increased to 11,000, while Ukraine has put the figure higher, at up to 12,000.Moscow and Pyongyang have trumpeted their increased defense cooperation since the launch of the invasion, but the Kremlin has neither denied nor directly confirmed the presence of North Korean troops on its soil. The bolstering of Russian forces comes at a time when it appears to be making advances in Ukraine despite incurring heavy casualties. NATO's Rutte, in the face of the battlefield gains by Russia and the election in the United States of Donald Trump, who has been critical of how much aid the West has given to Kyiv, called for continued support of Ukraine from allies. 'We must recommit to stay the course of the war and we must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight,' Rutte said.'We need to raise the cost for Putin and his enabling authoritarian threats by providing Ukraine with the support it needs to change the trajectory of the conflict.' Macron agreed, saying the 'only way toward negotiations' was to make sure that nothing is decided about 'Ukraine without the Ukrainians and on Europe without the Europeans.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVjliLstpT1dl	2024-11-12T15:46:12-08:00	
Patriarch Kirill Says He Doesn’t Oppose Restoration Of Death Pena...	In yet another example of Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill’s willingness to engage in mental gymnastics to come out in support of whatever he believes the Kremlin wants, he now says that the apostles didn’t object to the death penalty when the Romans applied it to Jesus so he won’t oppose its restoration in Russia. That creative interpretation of the Bible, Aleksandr Soldatov says, is just a small part of the neo-paganism which Kirill has long been associated with, a religion that has little to do with Christianity as it is typically understood but fits perfectly with Putin’s view (t.me/mozhemobyasnit/19287 reposted at poligonmedia.appspot.com/aleksandr-soldatov/ and summarized at charter97.org/ru/news/2024/11/7/617975/). According to the specialist on religious life in Russia, Kirill has led his church to completely substitute military patriotic views in place of Christian ones, with the center of his faith 'not the Gospels but with an ideology connected with the romanticism of military actions' taken by the Russian state. For Kirill and those who follow him, 'Jesus no is only one of the gods in the pantheon of the Russian Orthodox Church: on its icons appear the image of Stalin, and the main church of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation features amulets from the computer game Warhammer' rather than the Bible. Those who follow the current patriarch including both the priesthood and the laity are told that 'in war all means are good' and shown that the church is prepared to support 'any mechanism' to promote them 'including those which are purely occult' and have nothing to do with Christian traditions, according to the specialist on the Russian Orthodox Church today. The teachings of Christ are turned upside down, the researcher says, with Christ’s injunction not to kill being recast as an order to do just that, Soldatov concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVmgWWBmRxHQw	2024-11-12T15:44:54-08:00	
Biden Reiterates ‘Ironclad’ Commitment To Israel During Meeting W...	President Joe Biden reiterated his 'ironclad' defense of Israel during a Tuesday Oval Office meeting with Israel’s president – and he echoed the wish to see the return of the remaining hostages still held by militant group Hamas after more than a year of brutal conflict in Gaza. 'My commitment to Israel is ironclad,' Biden told President Isaac Herzog during their morning meeting in the White House. 'And we share a deep friendship.' Herzog underscored his government’s main objective: 'First and foremost, we have to get the hostages back.' 'It all starts in Tehran,' he said. 'It all starts in the empire of evil, where, in Tehran, with its proxies, they are doing whatever they can to derail stability and security and peace, calling for the annihilation of the State of Israel and seeking nuclear weapons, Mr. President, this has to be a major objective all throughout your term and the next term of the next president, because we have to make sure that they cannot fulfill their evil intentions.' A day earlier in Washington, Herzog told a gathering of North American Jewish community groups that the Israeli administration considers incoming President Donald Trump 'a champion of peace and cooperation and a great friend of Israel.' Washington is Israel’s top military and diplomatic supporter, and these mannered talks are happening against a backdrop of violence. Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in Gaza, Palestinian authorities said Tuesday, and plumes of smoke were rising above the southern Beirut’s suburbs less than an hour after Israeli forces told residents to evacuate. While fighting continues, international aid groups issued a report saying Israel has not met a Tuesday deadline set by the U.S. to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip. But the Israeli military said hundreds of packages of food and water have been brought to an area in northern Gaza where it has been focusing operations. Last month, the Biden administration told Israel to 'surge' more food and supplies into Gaza or risk a cut in military aid. The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer met in Washington on Monday and 'reviewed steps that Israel has taken to improve the dire humanitarian situation inside Gaza in a response to the letter sent by the secretary and Secretary of Defense [Lloyd] Austin on October 13.' 'The secretary emphasized the importance of ensuring those changes lead to an actual improvement in the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, including through the delivery of additional assistance to civilians throughout Gaza. The secretary further reiterated the importance that Israel take every possible step to minimize civilian harm,' said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in a statement on Tuesday. On Tuesday, a group of eight international aid organizations said that of 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands, Israel failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza,' the report said. 'That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits to northern Gaza were denied or impeded last month. The office made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter each day, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Airstrikes in Gaza, Beirut A late Monday strike killed at least 11 people in a cafeteria west of Khan Younis, according to officials at Nasser Hospital. A strike early Tuesday hit a house at a refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Early Tuesday, the Israeli army told residents in Beirut's southern suburbs to leave immediately, warning that it would strike Hezbollah targets there. 'You are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, against which the Israel Defense Forces will act in the near future,' military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that included a map showing the buildings it would target in the Lebanese capital. Less than an hour later, according to Agence France-Presse, two strikes hit the area and plumes of gray smoke were rising. Witnesses told AFP gunfire could be heard in the area ahead of the strikes warning shots by residents for people to leave following the evacuation call. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, said on X Tuesday that during a meeting with military officials, he reiterated that Israel will continue hitting Hezbollah with full force and that there will be no cease-fire. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVsi3VDybq_GJ	2024-11-12T15:41:31-08:00	
Humanitarian Chiefs Say Israel Failed To Meet US Deadline For All...	By Ephrem Kossaify Israel has failed to meet critical Gaza-related humanitarian demands set by the US government, according to a report published jointly by eight major humanitarian organizations. The failure comes 'at an enormous human cost for Palestinian civilians' in the enclave, where the humanitarian situation 'is now at its worst point' since the war began in October 2023, they said. Their assessment comes a month after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to Israeli officials demanding the implementation of concrete measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days. This deadline passed on Tuesday with no significant signs of progress. Instead, Israeli forces have accelerated their efforts 'to bombard, depopulate, deprive and erase the Palestinian population of the North Gaza governorate,' said Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America. 'We are witnessing a campaign of ethnic cleansing,' she added. 'Oxfam and partner organizations are unable to provide any support to the remaining civilians in the North Gaza governorate, where people are dying every day. 'Access to the rest of Gaza is also severely restricted, with civilians facing starvation and relentless violence. The US must finally make this overdue call to suspend deadly arms sales to Israel or be complicit in the horrific atrocities unfolding before our eyes.' The aid organizations that contributed to the report, which also include Refugees International, Save the Children and MedGlobal, called on Washington to make an 'immediate determination' that Israel is in violation of its assurances under US and international law, and to suspend arms sales and impose restrictions on security cooperation, as required by US law. The report also urges the American government to press for immediate humanitarian pauses in military operations, the opening of more routes for deliveries of aid, and efforts to ensure civilians and medical facilities are protected. 'With experts again projecting imminent famine in northern Gaza, there is no time to lose,' said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International. The report 'clearly demonstrates that the Israeli government is violating its obligations (to) facilitate humanitarian relief for suffering Palestinians in Gaza,' he added. Zaher Sahloul, the president and co-founder of MedGlobal, said the organization’s local medical teams and international volunteers in Gaza have personally witnessed 'the complete failure by the Israeli authorities to ensure the delivery of critical supplies, including food, water and medicines, and to protect civilians and medical spaces.' He added: 'Our teams are living through the relentless bombing of hospitals, and our medics continue to treat wounded women and children every day. These are egregious violations of the cornerstone principle of international humanitarian law, which protects civilians in time of war.' Sahloul called on the Biden administration to 'do everything possible to push for the full provision of aid to Gaza’s desperate people.' In addition to the medical crisis, the blockade of Gaza has severely limited the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver aid. The report says convoys are still often blocked, delayed or looted, and access to key parts of the territory, especially in the north, remains severely restricted. 'I witnessed during my visit to Gaza last week the deliberate starvation of almost 2 million civilians, while the bombardment continues,' said Jan Egelan, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. 'There is barely any aid crossing into Gaza. The little that does get through is often looted, as the occupying power has obliterated the Palestinian police and refuses to secure, or provide secure access routes to, places where humanitarian organizations could distribute aid to a starving population.' Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps, said the US government must do 'everything in its power to ensure the unfettered provision of essential aid to people in desperate need.' The report highlights the dire food insecurity among the population of Gaza. Janti Soeripto, the president of Save the Children, said: 'Systemic impediments to the humanitarian system are making a deadly conflict even deadlier. 'Enough is enough. The facts are there. Adults have been failing children for over a year. What more will it take?' With winter and famine looming, the organizations warned that children in particular are at imminent risk, with many of them already suffering the effects of malnutrition. Sean Carroll, the president and CEO of American Near East Refugee Aid, said the organization’s 'humanitarian workers in Gaza have spent the past year expending superhuman effort in subhuman conditions to provide assistance to civilians.' He added: 'In the past month, we’ve seen families throughout Gaza, and particularly in the north, subjected to increasingly horrific conditions. This is a damning indictment of Israel’s failure to follow international humanitarian law and to respond to the critical and reasonable demands of its greatest ally, the United States. The consequences will be more innocent lives ended and destroyed. 'They should also include restrictions on Israel’s ability to continue prosecution of this war in a manner that is increasingly being seen as consistent with ethnic cleansing.' The report warns that with more than 2 million civilians in Gaza facing starvation, daily bombardments and lack of access to the basic necessities of life, the humanitarian situation in the territory is on the brink of catastrophe. 'There is no time to lose,' it concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVr0AcgOF4eBb	2024-11-12T15:40:05-08:00	
Canvas Of Diplomacy: How Art And Culture Shape Global Relations –...	In a globalized world, art and culture serve as powerful forms of communication and soft power. Nations employ cultural diplomacy, harnessing art, music, literature, and film to foster goodwill, build alliances, and bridge ideological divides. Beyond official diplomacy, art and culture influence how societies perceive each other, shaping international relations through public opinion, mutual respect, and shared values. This article dives into the nuanced ways in which art and culture impact international relations, from facilitating cross-cultural understanding to acting as subtle tools of influence and soft power. Art and Culture as Tools of Soft Power Soft power, a term popularized by political scientist Joseph Nye, refers to the ability of a country to shape the preferences of others through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion. Art and culture play a central role in this process, as they offer avenues for countries to express their identities and values. Through cultural products such as music, film, and literature, nations present an idealized version of themselves, building a global image that fosters affinity and cooperation. For example, American pop culture has been instrumental in shaping perceptions of the United States as a land of opportunity and freedom. Hollywood films, jazz music, and fashion trends project an image that appeals to youth and progressive thinkers worldwide. Similarly, Japan's post-World War II recovery saw the export of cultural phenomena such as manga, anime, and culinary traditions, contributing to Japan's modern image as a technologically advanced and culturally rich nation. Cultural Diplomacy: Bridging Divides and Building Alliances Governments increasingly recognize the value of cultural diplomacy in forging stronger international ties. Cultural exchanges, art exhibitions, language programs, and festivals promote cross-cultural understanding, fostering goodwill that can ease diplomatic tensions. For instance, the Goethe-Institut, Alliance Française, and the British Council are state-funded organizations that promote German, French, and British cultures, respectively, around the world. These organizations provide language classes, fund art exhibits, and organize cultural events to foster understanding and cooperation. During the Cold War, cultural diplomacy played a crucial role in U.S.-Soviet relations. The U.S. State Department funded jazz tours in Eastern Europe, using American music to counter Soviet propaganda and humanize Americans in the eyes of communist societies. Similarly, the Soviet Union promoted ballet, classical music, and literature as symbols of its cultural sophistication, hoping to win the hearts and minds of audiences in the West. By focusing on shared cultural values, these initiatives sought to lessen ideological divides, creating points of contact that would be difficult to establish through traditional diplomacy. Art and Culture in Public Diplomacy: Shaping National Image Public diplomacy uses art and culture to reach foreign populations, presenting a favorable image of a country to build mutual understanding and respect. This form of diplomacy is increasingly essential in a digital age, where information—and disinformation—spreads rapidly. For instance, South Korea's government actively supports the global spread of K-pop, fashion, and Korean drama, cultivating a positive international image known as the 'Korean Wave' or Hallyu. Through entertainment, South Korea has attracted millions of fans globally, fostering a youth-driven affinity for Korean culture that enhances its diplomatic relationships. China's Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture abroad, are another example. While some view these institutes with suspicion, seeing them as a tool for political influence, they offer many people around the world their first exposure to Chinese history, art, and philosophy. This mix of education and cultural immersion can soften perceptions of China, presenting it as a nation with a rich, centuries-old civilization and promoting cooperation on issues like trade and education. The Role of Art in Cross-Cultural Understanding Artistic exchanges and collaborations provide opportunities for countries to understand each other's perspectives and values. When people engage with foreign art, literature, or film, they gain insights into the cultural context and worldview of the artists, building empathy and reducing stereotypes. For instance, African art exhibitions in Europe and North America have exposed global audiences to diverse African cultural expressions, challenging reductive narratives of Africa as a monolithic entity. Literature, in particular, has been a powerful force in fostering cross-cultural understanding. Writers like Chinua Achebe, Haruki Murakami, and Gabriel García Márquez have captivated readers globally, offering perspectives on Nigerian, Japanese, and Latin American life, respectively. By reading stories that reflect the values, struggles, and triumphs of different societies, audiences around the world develop a more nuanced understanding of these cultures, which can influence how they view these nations on the world stage. Art as Protest and Political Commentary: A Double-Edged Sword While art and culture can promote understanding, they also serve as vehicles for political critique and resistance. Artists often address themes of oppression, human rights, and political freedom, challenging authoritarian governments and exposing social injustices. Art that critiques state policies or champions minority rights can resonate internationally, creating solidarity movements and putting pressure on governments to uphold democratic values. One example is the influence of Soviet dissident art during the Cold War. Writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and artists like Marc Chagall challenged Soviet repression, influencing international views of the USSR. In modern times, artists like Ai Weiwei have used their work to critique Chinese government policies, drawing attention to issues of censorship and human rights in China. Such art has become a diplomatic issue, as countries hosting dissident exhibitions can strain relations with the artist's home country. Music as a Unifying Force and Cultural Ambassador Music, as a universal language, has a unique ability to connect people across cultural divides. Jazz, rock, and hip-hop have become globally popular, bridging gaps and creating shared experiences. During the Cold War, jazz was used as a diplomatic tool, with musicians like Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie performing worldwide to embody American ideals of freedom and creativity. More recently, hip-hop has emerged as a voice for youth globally, with artists in countries like France, Brazil, and South Africa using the genre to address social and political issues. Cultural exchanges in music have also fostered collaborations between nations. In the Middle East, for example, programs that bring Western musicians together with local artists help to build mutual respect and understanding. Such musical diplomacy initiatives foster goodwill, allowing nations to connect on a human level, beyond politics. Cinema and Media: Shaping Global Perceptions Film and television have a far-reaching impact on international relations, as they reach global audiences and shape perceptions of foreign cultures. Hollywood, for example, has long played a role in portraying American society and values, sometimes reinforcing stereotypes but also celebrating the diversity and resilience of American life. Films like Schindler's List, The Kite Runner, and Slumdog Millionaire have raised awareness of historical events, cultural practices, and social issues, influencing how audiences perceive different nations and inspiring empathy. Non-Western cinema also shapes international perceptions. Indian Bollywood films, known for their vibrant storytelling, have gained popularity in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, building a cultural bridge between India and these regions. Iranian cinema, with directors like Abbas Kiarostami and Asghar Farhadi, has won international acclaim for its storytelling, offering viewers a glimpse into Iranian society and countering simplistic narratives about the country. Cultural Festivals and International Showcases Cultural festivals offer platforms for countries to showcase their art, music, food, and traditions, providing audiences a firsthand experience of diverse cultures. Events like the Edinburgh International Festival, Venice Biennale, and Cannes Film Festival serve as hubs for cultural exchange, where artists, critics, and audiences from around the world come together. These festivals foster dialogue and mutual understanding, allowing countries to celebrate their heritage while contributing to global cultural discourse. Sports events, such as the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, also play a significant role in cultural diplomacy. While primarily athletic competitions, these events allow nations to display their cultural heritage on a global stage, as seen in the elaborate opening ceremonies that showcase art, dance, and music. Hosting these events gives countries a chance to enhance their international image and foster pride and unity among their citizens. The Digital Age: Art, Culture, and the Internet's Role in Diplomacy In the digital age, social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok allow artists and cultural influencers to reach global audiences instantly. Cultural diplomacy has taken on new dimensions as individuals, rather than governments, become ambassadors of their culture, sharing their art, traditions, and perspectives with the world. For example, TikTok has popularized K-pop dance challenges, bringing Korean music to millions of people and furthering South Korea's cultural influence. Digital art exhibitions and virtual museums, which became particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, allow people worldwide to access art and culture, democratizing cultural diplomacy. Online collaborations between artists from different countries also foster cross-cultural exchange, as creators share ideas, techniques, and themes that reflect their unique cultural contexts. Conclusion Art and culture profoundly impact international relations by shaping perceptions, building alliances, and fostering understanding. Whether through public diplomacy, cultural exchanges, or digital media, the power of art and culture extends beyond national borders, influencing how societies view each other and interact on the global stage. As technology advances, the reach of cultural diplomacy will only grow, offering new opportunities to connect across divides, promote mutual respect, and find common ground in a diverse and interconnected world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfrlHnSWGDEcJz-NZWV9yh7	2024-11-12T08:59:22-08:00	
Tajikistan’s High-Level Round Table At The European Parliament: U...	On November 19, 2024, the 'Tajikistan High-Level Round Table' will take place at the European Parliament. The Tajik government, highly concerned with the climate crisis, aims to engage Europeans in the fight against climate change and to address the melting glaciers in Tajikistan, which also affect neighboring countries. Tajikistan, a land of glaciers and mountains, is facing a climate crisis. Over the past 40 years, Tajikistan has lost more than 1,000 of its 14,000 glaciers, with harmful consequences for the entire Central Asian region, as noted by Deputy Director of the Hydrometeorology Agency of Tajikistan, Karimjon Abduhalimov, at the 2019 Central Asia Climate Change Conference (CACCC-2019) in Uzbekistan. The Country Needs Help President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan proposes establishing an international fund for glacier protection and declaring 2025 the International Year of Glaciers. During his speech at the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, 2024, President Rahmon emphasized the importance of uniting the international community to ensure security, maintain stability, and achieve sustainable development. With the scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) affirming climate change, it is hopeful to see heads of state aware of this urgent global issue. In parallel, Rahmon emphasized his country’s unwavering support for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tajikistan, a mountainous Central Asian country, is particularly sensitive to climate change and directly impacted by global warming. Research shows that both the Tajik population and government are highly aware of climate change issues. Tajikistan is a partner country of the EU, and aligns with the EU on several issues. Despite the crises and rising extremism across its border with Afghanistan, Tajikistan rejects extremism and refuses any engagement with the Taliban. Although the two countries share a similar language, related to Persian—one of the oldest Indo-European languages—Tajikistan remains hostile to the Taliban. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit held in Dushanbe on September 16-17, President Rahmon denounced the Taliban’s 'medieval Sharia' and expressed concern over the potential spread of their 'destructive ideas in the region.' This alignment with the EU is particularly beneficial for both sides, especially on environmental and climate issues. EU Interest in Climate Change Mitigation The EU is particularly attentive to climate change and aims to help developing and underdeveloped countries face climate risks. The EU intends to support the Tajik government’s efforts to address climate change. Tajikistan also faces other environmental challenges, such as land degradation, water shortages, and rising temperatures. The EU’s engagement with Tajikistan has grown significantly since the country’s independence in 1991. The foundation of EU-Tajikistan relations is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), effective since 2010. In early 2023, the EU and Tajikistan began negotiations on an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA). Regionally, At the regional level, the Republic of Tajikistan is a partner in the EU’s Central Asia Strategy, adopted in June 2019. This strategy outlines the overall cooperation objectives and priorities for EU engagement in the region, focusing on promoting resilience, prosperity, and regional cooperation in Central Asia. Enhancing resilience also means enabling the region to cope with climate change. The EU’s cooperation with Tajikistan for the 2021-2027 period will build on past achievements in key areas such as health, public financial management, water, energy, and agriculture, while expanding support for empowering SMEs, greening the economy, and reducing disaster risks. Water is a particularly critical issue for Tajikistan. The EU’s bilateral development assistance allocation for the 2021-2024 period amounts to €91 million. Three priority areas have been identified for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Indicative Programme: Inclusive Green and Digital Economy; Human Development; and Natural Resources Management, Efficiency, and Resilience. Many glaciers cover the high altitudes of the Pamirs, including the longest glacier outside the polar regions, the Fedchenko Glacier, which stretches over 70 km and has an estimated depth of 800 meters. The Tajik Pamirs thus contain a massive water reservoir for Central Asia, feeding the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers—key contributors to the desiccation of the Aral Sea. Eastern Pamir is dominated by a high, arid plateau with tall mountains at an average altitude of 4,420 meters (ranging from 2,970 to 7,130 meters), while Western Pamir features high, steep valleys with an average altitude of 4,060 meters (ranging from 900 to 7,490 meters). According to the World Bank, Tajikistan is the most climate-vulnerable country in Central Asia and Europe, with significant temperature variations between high and low altitudes. Six percent of Tajikistan’s territory is covered in glaciers. Located at the edge of the Pamir Mountains, the country has lost 'more than 1,000 of its 14,000 glaciers [out of over 200,000 glaciers worldwide]' in the past 40 years, as lamented by the President. This glacier melt will impact all countries in Central Asia. In conclusion, The climate issues to be discussed with the Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs will therefore be key points for both Central Asian countries and the rest of the world.

NATO Secretary General And President Macron Discuss Defence Produ...	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and President Emmanuel Macron discussed on Tuesday (12 November) the need to step up support for Ukraine, ramp up defence production and boost transatlantic defence industrial cooperation. During his first official visit to Paris since taking office, the Secretary General highlighted the importance of France’s high-end military capabilities and skilled armed forces for the collective security of the Alliance. They discussed the need for increased defence investment and robust transatlantic cooperation to ensure the Alliance’s lasting security. 'The more we spend on defence, the more we reduce the risk of future conflict,' said Rutte. Mr. Rutte and President Macron also discussed the need for more support for Ukraine ahead of what could be its harshest winter, as Russia relentlessly targets its energy infrastructure. Mr Rutte commended France for training and equipping an entire Ukrainian brigade, the Anne of Kyiv Brigade, and for its pledge to send Mirage fighter jets early next year. 'France has delivered advanced artillery guns, air defence systems, cruise missiles, and armoured vehicles,' he said. The Secretary General also raised concerns about deepening military ties between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, which pose a threat to European security and global peace. Prior to his meeting with the French President, the Secretary General visited the factory floor of the French defence industry company Thales Group. During the visit, Mr Rutte met with young talents and engineers developing cutting-edge capabilities for NATO Allies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTiVKazl6QtDd	2024-11-12T08:54:38-08:00	
How Political Psychology And Political Economy Shape Great Power ...	Great power politics has long been influenced by a complex interrelationship of psychological motivations and economic interests. Political psychology delves into how perceptions, biases, and ideologies drive the decisions of leaders and nations, while political economy analyzes how resources, trade dynamics, and economic policies define power relations and influence global strategies. Together, these disciplines illuminate the underlying forces shaping the ambitions, rivalries, and alliances that characterize great power politics, offering insights into the strategies employed by nations in pursuit of dominance and security. The Historical Roots of Power and Psychology Historically, great power dynamics have been influenced by both psychological and economic factors. The realpolitik approach, often attributed to Niccolò Machiavelli and Otto von Bismarck, emphasized power and pragmatism, grounded in a psychological understanding of self-interest and survival. Leaders like Bismarck strategically used economic power to consolidate alliances and counter rivals, illustrating how psychological acumen and economic prowess have been central to maintaining influence. The 20th-century Cold War era further underscores the impact of political psychology and economy on great power behavior. The ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union was driven by psychological elements, such as the fear of mutually assured destruction, as well as economic competition for influence through development aid and trade agreements with allied nations. This bipolar rivalry illustrates how deeply psychological and economic factors define not only bilateral relations but also the alignment of third-party states. Economic Power as a Tool of Influence In contemporary great power politics, economic influence has become a primary tool for projecting power and securing alliances. Joseph Nye's concept of 'soft power' highlights how economic strategies—such as trade agreements, investment in infrastructure, and economic aid—allow nations to shape global politics without direct military intervention. For example, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is not only an economic venture but a geopolitical strategy aimed at extending influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Through the BRI, China is both satisfying economic interests and shaping global political alignments, reflecting the dual role of political psychology and economy in its international strategy. Economic sanctions, as employed by the United States and European Union against rivals, further demonstrate how political economy intersects with psychological tactics. Sanctions leverage economic interdependence to coerce states into policy changes without armed conflict, capitalizing on the psychological pressures of financial distress and the fear of isolation. This tool exemplifies how economic measures can target the psychological resilience of a state, aiming to weaken morale and create internal political pressure. Psychological Drivers Behind Strategic Decision-Making The psychological dimension of great power politics often centers on national identity, prestige, and the perceived need for security. Leaders of great powers are often influenced by cognitive biases, such as prospect theory, which suggests that decision-makers prioritize avoiding losses over achieving equivalent gains. This loss aversion often drives states to maintain aggressive foreign policies and resist changes that could diminish their status, even if such strategies are costly. For example, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, despite economic sanctions, reflects a decision driven by national identity and loss aversion, prioritizing historical ties and strategic interests over economic concerns. National identity and status are also critical psychological drivers. Research on social identity theory, initially introduced by Henri Tajfel, reveals how groups define themselves by distinguishing from 'others.' In great power politics, this translates to a pursuit of status and recognition on the global stage. For instance, the United States and China often engage in psychological signaling, each promoting its system—democracy versus authoritarian capitalism—as superior, while vying for leadership in global organizations such as the United Nations and World Health Organization. Geopolitical Rivalries and Economic Competition Economic competition among great powers fuels rivalries, with political economy playing a significant role in shaping alliances, trade policies, and resource control. The competition for technological supremacy in fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing illustrates how economic power underpins geopolitical influence. Countries like the United States and China invest heavily in technology, viewing it as both an economic asset and a strategic advantage in intelligence, defense, and economic productivity. The rivalry over rare earth minerals—a key resource for advanced electronics and green technology—further highlights the strategic value of economic assets in great power competition. As China controls the majority of rare earth production, other powers like the United States, Japan, and the European Union are developing policies to diversify their supply chains. This competition reflects not only economic interests but also psychological dimensions of distrust, competition, and a desire for security against supply disruptions. The Role of Domestic Political Psychology in Shaping Foreign Policy Domestic public opinion and national sentiment significantly impact great power politics. Leaders often cater to domestic psychological pressures, such as nationalism, to gain public support for foreign policy initiatives. Graham Allison's concept of the 'Thucydides Trap' argues that rising powers (like China) and established powers (like the United States) are prone to conflict due to mutual distrust and competition. These psychological underpinnings shape how domestic politics influence foreign policy, as leaders seek to rally public support by framing rival states as threats to national security and identity. Elections and political cycles also affect great power behavior. Politicians often adopt aggressive foreign policies to appeal to nationalist sentiments during elections, creating short-term escalations in global politics. This tendency is evident in both democracies and authoritarian regimes, where leaders seek to unify public opinion through foreign policy stances that emphasize strength and resilience. Psychological Warfare and Strategic Communication Psychological operations and information warfare are increasingly central to great power conflicts. Disinformation campaigns, cyber espionage, and propaganda exploit cognitive biases, shaping public opinion and undermining adversaries' social cohesion. Russia's use of information warfare in the 2016 U.S. election demonstrates how psychological tactics can influence the political landscape of rival states, destabilizing them from within. China's media influence in Africa and Asia also exemplifies psychological tactics in geopolitical strategy. By controlling narratives through state-run media, China seeks to shape perceptions of its leadership model, challenging Western influence in developing regions. Such psychological strategies complement economic investments, aiming to foster positive public sentiment and political support in strategically valuable regions. Conclusion The relationship between political psychology and political economy is central to understanding the complexities of great power politics. Psychological factors such as identity, status, and perception of threats drive strategic decisions, while economic assets and policies provide the means to execute these strategies. As global power dynamics continue to shift, the convergence of political psychology and economy will remain essential in shaping the behavior and ambitions of great powers, underscoring the enduring connection between the human psyche, economic interests, and the pursuit of global influence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTiYmEnCHkSAu	2024-11-12T08:53:22-08:00	
Oil Demand Forecasts And The Future Of The Middle East – OpEd	World oil consumption has increased by nearly 10 percent over the past decade, reaching 4.5 billion tons last year. (1) This performance was achieved despite a 9 percent drop in 2020 due to the pandemic. Considering that the growth rate in the preceding decade was roughly the same, it is hard to say that global consumption shows signs of slowing. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) disagrees. (2) According to its recently published World Energy Outlook 2024 report, (3) global oil consumption will peak in the next 10 years and then start to decline. Moreover, this is the agency’s most optimistic forecast. The report also includes two disaster scenarios for the oil industry: In the first scenario, if governments fulfill their climate commitments to the United Nations, oil consumption will fall by almost 50 percent in just 15 years. In the second, if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions target by 2050, then consumption 15 years from now will be less than half of today’s level. According to this Paris-based organization, the era of fossil fuels is nearing its end. The momentum behind the transition to clean energy is so strong that global demand for coal, oil, and natural gas has begun to fall rapidly. The agency bases its view on oil mainly on the slowdown in Chinese consumption and the acceleration of electric vehicle sales. However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) forecasts paint a completely different picture. OPEC insists that global oil demand will continue to grow at least until 2050 and that the peak is nowhere in sight. (4) Moreover, it regards the IEA’s forecasts as fantasies (5) that have no connection with reality and even considers them dangerous. (6) Consequently, it seems highly unlikely that these two organizations will be able to reach an agreement on the future of oil. However, the question of which side is right is of vital importance for oil-producing countries, especially for those in the Middle East, one of the hottest regions in the world today. Most countries in this region, which hosts the world's largest oil reserves, have economies heavily dependent on this fuel, with oil exports accounting for a significant portion of both their budgets and national income. For instance, oil revenues contribute around 40 percent to Iraq and Kuwait's GDP, over 20 percent for Saudi Arabia and Oman, and around 20 percent for Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. (7) Therefore, considering their high levels of dependence on oil, it would not be an exaggeration to say that these countries could face existential challenges if even the most optimistic forecasts of the IEA come true. Middle Eastern countries, aware of the risks posed to them by the transformation process from fossil fuels to cleaner sources, are taking measures to ease the transition and are making plans to survive in a low-carbon future. To this end, they are trying to take part in all kinds of projects aimed at restructuring supply chains and seeking strategic partnerships amid global power struggles. However, it is difficult to say that all countries in the region are successful in this regard, and they are the ones that should be most concerned about the approaching danger. It is clear that oil demand estimates are creating significant tension in the Middle East. Now the question is: Which of the two organizations will be proven right? Will it be the IEA, a creation of the Western bloc led by the US following the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, which is now accused of manipulating the process with analyses tailored to the bloc's interests? Or will it be the OPEC, an organization established to manage global oil supply and wholly dedicated to the interests of exporting nations? We can foresee that the increasingly visible energy transition will heighten tensions in the region and that much harder times are coming for the geography. Moreover, if the IEA proves to be right in the forecasting wars, it would not be a prophecy to say that the geopolitical balances in the Middle East will be turned upside down within a few years, leaving those relying on today’s status quo on the losing side.

Iran’s Military-Security Budget To Increase By 200 Percent – OpEd	In conjunction with the ratification of Iranian regime President Masoud Pezeshkian’s budget proposal in parliament, the spokesperson for the government announced that the country’s military budget would see a 200 percent increase. She stated, 'Every effort has been made to address the country’s defense needs, with special attention given to this matter; consequently, the military budget will experience a 200 percent increase.' This increase effectively triples the military budget of the clerical regime. Economist Ahmad Alavi views the 2025 budget as rooted in rent distribution among the nation’s political and economic players. One defining feature of Iran’s economy is the divide between inclusive organizations, which promote economic growth and development, and extractive institutions, which function to capture rents and serve the interests of a small elite, the oligarchy that holds power. A significant portion of the budget is allocated to institutions controlled by oligarchs, power factions, and groups close to the regime. These institutions include large foundations and economic enterprises such as the 'Execution of Imam Khomeini’s Order' foundation, and Astan Quds Razavi, which are tax-exempt or evade taxes and operate under the direct supervision of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. These entities benefit from state funds, part of which they direct towards commercial, political, and religious activities without significant economic returns for society. Additionally, substantial budget allocations go to military and security entities like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), IRGC Basij forces, and affiliated propaganda, religious, and quasi-political organizations. Such allocations align with the theory of extractive institutions, where resources are used not for infrastructure or production, but to strengthen political control and influence. A Quarter of the Budget Directed Toward Military and Suppression Forces Research by Iran Open Data Center shows that this year, the direct budget for armed forces, including the Ministry of Defense, the Army, the IRGC, and the police, has reached at least 7.22 quadrillion rials. This amount is allocated not only within the main budget lines but also from crude oil revenue. In the 2023 budget, military appropriations totaled 5.25 quadrillion rials. Oil Sales to Fund Military-Security Expenditures According to Clause B of Exemption Four, 1.37 quadrillion rials’ worth of crude oil is allocated to the armed forces under the heading 'strengthening defense capability.' In addition, 1.8 billion euros in crude oil is earmarked for 'special projects' for the military, but due to its confidentiality, little information is available. Thus, as outlined in Budget Table 21 for 2024, the armed forces will receive over 2.53 quadrillion rials from oil quotas. In his continued pursuit of warmongering policies, Khamenei stated, 'The quality of expressing the nation’s power and will must be determined by the officials, and what is in the nations and country’s best interest must be done.' This anti-people policy is clearly reflected in Pezeshkian’s government military budget. On October 29, Euronews reported that the budget allocated to Iran’s military forces next year is expected to be around 2.17 quadrillion rials. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Iran’s regime spent $10.3 billion on military expenses in 2023. The IRGC’s share of total military expenditures in 2019 was about 27 percent, rising to 37 percent in 2023. According to Clause One, Exemption Three of the 2025 budget proposal of the 11.96 quadrillion rials in revenue from crude oil, gas, and condensate exports, 5.61 quadrillion rials will be allocated to the armed forces to 'strengthen defense capability.' This amount is four times the oil quota allocated to the armed forces in the 2024 budget. In addition, another 1.26 quadrillion rials is earmarked as 'other allocations for specific projects,' likely distributed among military and security institutions. In defense of the budget proposal, Pezeshkian said: 'We obtained permission from the supreme leader to use some foreign exchange, usually reserved mid-year to cover deficits and address social protests.' Despite severe concerns within the regime about uprisings by millions of impoverished citizens, budgetary imbalances and deficits have left no other options for the people than rising prices, inflation, and worsening poverty. Final uprisings soon are inevitable and unavoidable. Increased pressure on the suffering people will pave the way for the courageous and aware youth of Iran to rise until the flames of their struggle engulf the oppressors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTv9eaE-o_WFl	2024-11-12T08:48:36-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Victory And The Iranian Regime’s Concerns Over His...	Contrary to polls and predictions that anticipated a tight race between the Democratic and Republican candidates, Donald Trump made a historic return to the White House by defeating his opponent, Kamala Harris, Vice President under President Joe Biden. According to CNN’s exit polls, slightly over half of voters preferred Trump over Harris for economic management, with 31% of voters identifying it as their top issue. Following the announcement of Trump’s victory and his return to the White House, Iran’s currency, the Rial (Iran currency) hit a record low. Speculations about the impact of Trump’s second term on Iran largely stem from his policies during his previous presidency, which included 'maximum pressure' on Iran. These policies could mean additional sanctions and heightened military tensions. On Thursday evening, October 7, Brian Hook, former head of the 'Iran Action Group' in Trump’s previous administration, accused the Biden administration in a CNN interview of seeking 'compromise with the Iranian regime,' which he claimed has led to a 'failure of deterrence policy.' The former U.S. envoy on Iran emphasized that Trump understands that the primary source of instability in the Middle East today is the Iranian regime.' But 'Trump has no interest in regime change' in Tehran but is focused on isolating and weakening the Islamic Republic. He also stated that Trump’s 'Peace Plan' for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, known as the 'Deal of the Century,' is likely to return to the table. With Trump’s return, Iran’s state-controlled media have acknowledged that the various crises confronting the Iranian regime, including economic turmoil and social discontent, will intensify. This time, however, the situation is markedly different from Trump’s first term. The regime is grappling with a severe economic crisis, having withstood two nationwide uprisings demanding its overthrow, with no end to the economic crisis in sight. The escalating conflict with Israel, efforts to dismantle Iran’s regional proxies, and attempts to acquire nuclear weapons as a survival guarantee have raised global concern. On Thursday, November 7, the newspaper Ham-Mihan noted: 'Iran’s economy today in November 2024 is weaker than in 2018. The internal challenges and crises we have faced are now more extensive than ever. According to our foreign minister, international conditions are vastly different from the period when the JCPOA was signed and subsequently abandoned by Trump. We are dealing with the fallout from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and issues between Iran and the West have become more complicated over the past six years. There is no short- or medium-term solution in sight. Hardliners are trying to promote BRICS as a substitute for addressing Iran’s sanctions issues, but even the most optimistic experts believe it will take decades for BRICS to yield significant results. At least two of its most influential members, China and India, remain among the top ten U.S. trading partners.' Donald Trump's potential policies may follow the same path as his previous term but with greater intensity and a focus on threats beyond Iran’s nuclear program. Trump’s policies toward Iran were based on maximum pressure and targeting Iran's oil revenues, which in 2020 reduced Iran’s oil exports to an unprecedented level. These policies would likely be repeated in a new term with a stronger emphasis on economic pressure and limiting Iran’s regional influence and its support for proxy groups. Given that Trump and his team see the Iranian regime as the 'axis of evil' in the Middle East, the focus of their policies could be on Iran's nuclear threat and its regional policies and support for armed groups and militias. The goal of these actions could be an attempt to isolate the regime and weaken its bases of influence and survival in the region, which, according to some analysts, could lead to internal weakening of the regime and make it more vulnerable to domestic protests and organized resistance. Trump and his team would likely use stronger sanctions and a more extensive crackdown on Iran's oil trade and its supporters to push Iran into the most restricted economic and strategic position possible. These pressures, disregarding new regional conditions and developments, would pose a serious challenge for Iran and might lead to responses and decisions from Iran. In this regard The Wall Street Journal wrote: Donald Trump intends to significantly increase sanctions against Iran and reduce the country’s oil sales. His new team will quickly move to choke off Iran's oil revenue, including targeting ports and foreign traders handling Iranian oil.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXvSsGeDso5kF	2024-11-12T08:44:11-08:00	
COP29: Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter Publishes Its First Repo...	The Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC) published on November 11, its Baseline Report, setting a foundation to help prioritize and track progress on emissions reductions made by the 54 oil and gas companies - representing almost 45% of the global oil production, that have signed up to the Charter’s ambitions. These ambitions include to work toward net-zero operations by 2050, near-zero upstream methane emissions and zero routine flaring by 2030 in addition to measuring and publicly reporting progress towards meeting OGDC’s goals. The publication of the Baseline Report is a key milestone for OGDC that sets out the work achieved in the first year since the initiative was launched at COP28. In the past 12 months, OGDC has established a governance framework and launched a survey to determine signatories’ emissions reduction ambitions and implementation plans to set a baseline to track future progress. OGDC has also implemented a Collaborate & Share program to disseminate solutions, promote peer-to-peer collaboration and encourage the adoption of best practices to reduce emissions. In a sign of a positive momentum, the initiative has also attracted three new members, with Oil India Limited, PetroChina and Vår Energi joining. 'We are proud of the 54 companies that have already signed up to the Charter and are encouraged by the extent of their engagement in this first major piece of work that helps to establish a base on which to build future success,' OGDC’s three CEO Champions and founding members – Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) CEO Sultan Al Jaber, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser and TotalEnergies Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné, said in a joint statement. 'Each company is at a different phase of the decarbonization journey. For some, the Charter reflects existing commitments and aligns with pledges already made via other initiatives. For others, it marks their first steps toward climate action.' 'The diverse nature of our signatories is an opportunity as well as a challenge. Each company brings different experiences, capabilities, stakeholders and national circumstances. Signatories will have the opportunity to learn from the best practices and insights of peers from a wide range of backgrounds and from across the globe,' the CEOs said. OGDC’s Charter Baselining Survey found that the majority of signatories are already consistent with the Charter’s ambitions for net zero operations by 2050, and goals to reduce methane emissions to near zero and eliminate flaring by 2030. Gaps identified in the survey will help prioritize support and knowledge transfer from companies with relevant experience. The survey also found that a majority of the signatories already report on their greenhouse gas emissions, though there is a need for common standards and methodologies to establish a robust reporting framework for the group. According to the survey, most of the signatories are already investing in the energy systems of the future, including renewable energy, energy storage, low-carbon fuels, hydrogen, methane abatement, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and carbon removals technologies, and plan to increase investments. Bjorn Otto Sverdrup, the head of the OGDC Secretariat said: 'A survey of oil and gas industry climate performance has never been attempted on this scale. Participants ranged from companies that pioneered decarbonization decades ago to those still in the early phases – all with different capabilities and reporting methods. The lessons learned will be used to improve reporting visibility and data quality and to create more targeted programs.' This baselining survey sets the foundation for the collective work ahead: over the next year, OGDC will focus on providing the resources and guidance the signatories need to reduce their GHG emissions, methane emissions and flaring. OGDC will also help signatories to shape their net-zero roadmaps and develop emissions reporting to ensure progress can be tracked and to demonstrate how collective action can deliver positive climate impact on a global scale.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXsVKTEsRjnGi	2024-11-12T08:38:01-08:00	
Collective Actions On Climate Change Urgent Instead Of Empty Prom...	The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement on climate change, was signed on January 11, 1997 in Kyoto, Japan to limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Although the protocol entered into force in 2005, its achievement remains questionable. Many countries may be complacent that they have reduced carbon emissions. But from the review of the data, it is not seen anywhere, instead, many people have opined that the situation is getting worse day by day. Bill Clinton was the US president when the treaty was executed. He hailed it as an 'environmentally and economically robust deal'. But ironically, US lawmakers rejected the deal in the Senate, and Bill Clinton's successor, President George W. Bush, withdrew America's support for the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush administration has criticized the Kyoto Protocol, saying that 80 percent of the world's countries have been exempted from emission standards in the agreement. Also, there is a danger of economic damage to the United States due to this. Russia is a major power. According to Andrey Illaryonov, a former adviser to the country's President Vladimir Putin, since human civilization is now based on the use of hydrocarbons, the adoption of the Kyoto agreement could have a negative impact on the Russian economy. Several developed and developing countries are major sources of carbon dioxide emissions and have not imposed any restrictions on themselves. So Illarionov's comment regarding the Kyoto agreement is discriminatory. James E. Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and distinguished climate scientist, claimed that the United Nations Climate Change Conference (including the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change—Cop 15 and Kyoto) held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, 7–18 December 2009 included the Fifth Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol) a 'farce'. He planned to boycott it. According to him, it is essentially trading in the name of emissions cap, known as 'cap and trade'. Here 'cap' refers to limiting or capping the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions. This is accomplished by issuing emission credits or carbon credits, where a certain amount of carbon dioxide is allowed to be emitted. According to Hansen, through this 'they are selling luxury'. Through this, developed countries are trying to absolve themselves of their responsibilities in exchange for giving small financial assistance to developing countries without reducing their own country's emissions. The issue is very much like 'killing a cow and donating shoes'. Hansen prefers and emphasizes the imposition of a 'carbon tax' rather than the 'cap and trade' of the Kyoto Protocol. Under his proposal, the tax would start at the equivalent of about $1 per gallon of gasoline, and the revenue collected would be returned directly to the public as a dividend against the carbon footprint. States signatories to the Kyoto Protocol have committed to reducing emissions but do not appear to be keeping them. For example, Japan's fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions have increased despite their strong commitment to this. Their use of coal has increased and although they have used various pollution control materials (offsets) to meet their objectives, these do not significantly reduce pollution. Greenhouse gases are no longer confined to the region or country from which they are emitted; Rather, they circulate in the atmosphere and spread everywhere. Therefore, not only high-emitting countries, but all countries worldwide must work to reduce emissions. Otherwise, the desired result will not be possible. The agreement appears to be following a few charts like many other agreements without encouraging any innovation in greenhouse gas emissions to curb global warming. While the Kyoto Protocol emphasized carbon emissions, it did not mention any action on other serious air pollutants such as oxides of sulfur or oxides of nitrogen. Methane as a greenhouse gas causes various damages to the atmosphere, but the Kyoto Protocol does not provide any guidelines for its control. That's right, world leaders can meet once a year on the occasion of this protocol, as is the Conference of the Parties (COP), the 29th session of which is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, November 11-22. There will be discussions for a few days; There will be some agreements and disagreements. There will be politics of blaming each other; Airplanes used to transport participants to the conference will emit huge amounts of environmentally damaging nitrogen oxide gas. Finally, there will be a lot of talk in the media; However, there will be little effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing global warming. It is only possible to get good results for all if any protocol is signed considering the global interest and not just the national interest based on the consensus of the states. If not, the climate change situation will become more dire due to global warming. Collective climate actions are urgent instead of empty promises.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXsBbxmj5gdmq	2024-11-12T08:36:08-08:00
