Islamic Extremism In Sri Lanka: A Rising Threat To South Asian Se...	Since the onset of Israel’s war on Hamas, the first incident of Israeli tourists facing terrorist threats abroad occurred in Sri Lanka. The war began on October 7 after Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage. In October, Israel’s National Security Council urged Israelis to leave Sri Lanka’s Arugam Bay area and other beaches in the island’s south and west immediately, citing terrorism threats in the eastern part of Sri Lanka. This announcement from the Israeli Defense Ministry followed a warning from the US embassy in Sri Lanka, which stated it had 'received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations' in eastern Arugam Bay. Eastern Arugam Bay, a hotspot for surfing around 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Colombo by road, is a popular destination for Israeli tourists. The Indian Intelligence Agency had given a tip-off on October 7 that foreigners could be targeted, the local media reported, citing the Acting Inspector General of Police. The Sri Lankan government has now received intelligence reports of attempts to propagate extremist ideologies within the Muslim population in the Eastern Province. Most of such activities have been reported from the Kalmunai area, prompting SIS and military intelligence units to increase monitoring. Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala has confirmed this, highlighting evidence of a breeding ground for Islamic extremism in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake informed Parliament that six arrests were made following intelligence reports about possible attacks on tourists in the Arugam Bay area. The April 2019 Easter attacks highlighted Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to the transnational Islamic Jihadi network. Up to 280 people, including foreigners, were killed in a series of suicide attacks orchestrated by ISIS-Sri Lanka (ISIS-S), which had its roots in Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim area in the Eastern Province. The Zion Church in Batticaloa, one of the Catholic churches targeted, was symbolically selected due to the association of 'Zion' with the Land of Israel. The Eastern Province of Sri Lanka is an area where Muslims live in large numbers. Due to natural population growth and the migration of the main community, Hindu Tamils, Muslims are now approaching near-majority status in the Eastern Province. In the strategically important area of Trincomalee, Muslims are currently the majority community. Given this background, the view that the Eastern Province belongs to Muslims has been slowly taking root among the Muslim polity for a long time. What many fail to see is that support for Palestine has been the basis for the penetration of Western and anti-Israel ideologies among Muslims in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. In October 2022, a local media outlet reported that India and Israel were planning to invest jointly in the development of the agriculture sector in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. This plan was immediately opposed by Muslims, who viewed Indian-Israeli involvement in Sri Lanka as a disaster. This opposition was based on the belief that Israel should not be allowed to enter a place that belongs to Muslims. The opportunity to engage with religious organizations in Islamic countries has created an environment conducive to the spread of Islamic extremist ideas in East Sri Lanka. Whenever jihadists gain prominence internationally or Islamic attacks on the United States and Israel occur, there is a celebratory spirit among Muslim groups in the Eastern Province. For instance, during al-Qaeda’s peak, Osama bin Laden’s translated speeches were distributed in some local mosques. All South Asian-based Jihadi groups endorsed Osama bin Laden’s global jihad declaration and regarded al-Qaeda as the vanguard of jihadism. The activities of jihadists from Gaza to Kashmir are indirectly celebrated among Muslim groups in East Sri Lanka. This has fostered a continuing environment of anti-Western and anti-Indian sentiment among the younger Muslim generation. It is within this context that the ideology of ISIS was able to easily penetrate Kattankudy in the Eastern part of Sri Lanka. Moulavi M.C. Zahran, considered the architect of the Easter attack, has long been involved in the spread of jihadism in Sri Lanka. In August 2009, local media reported that he was the Propaganda Secretary of the Kattankudy-based Thawheed group. This group follows the Wahabi school, named after Muhammed ibn Abd al-Wahab (1703-1792), described as the first modern Islamic fundamentalist. Against this backdrop, Kattankudy has become known as the island of Islamic life, a fertile ground for Wahhabi-Sufi confrontations in Sri Lanka. Wahhabi-influenced youth from Kattankudy began targeting Sufis, who practice a mystical form of Islam. Grenades were thrown, and swords were thrust, resulting in hundreds of Sufis being forced from their homes. A 2007 academic policy paper warned that violence by hardline Muslims against Sufis in Sri Lanka could eventually lead to armed movements in parts of the country. Some analysts incorrectly attribute the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Sri Lanka to the failure of successive Sri Lankan governments to address the socio-cultural, political, and economic grievances of the affected communities. In reality, Muslims in Sri Lanka should not be viewed as a community oppressed by the majority Sinhalese. Instead, they should be recognized as a community that has economically thrived by capitalizing on the civil war. Muslim politicians have held powerful ministerial positions in every government, including the ministries of foreign affairs and justice. The roots of Islamic extremism in Sri Lanka should be understood within the context of the religious global bond among Muslims. There are groups that identify themselves as global Muslims rather than citizens of a single country. It is within this framework that their jihadist mentality should be examined. The Sri Lankan government failed to anticipate the potential rise of globally inspired Islamic fundamentalist groups during the civil war. By allowing the formation of Muslim Home Guards to counter Tamil separatist militancy, the government inadvertently created an opportunity for these fundamentalist groups. This environment facilitated their easy establishment and organization in the region. Consequently, the notion that the Eastern Province was their territory gradually took hold among Muslim extremist groups. This progression vividly illustrates how Wahhabi preaching evolved into ISIS-Sri Lanka. The Iran-aligned Yemen-based Houthi terrorist group’s recent attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea exemplify how Islamic terrorism can serve as a proxy tool in geopolitical competition. Amidst global geopolitical rivalries, the rise of Islamic fundamentalist groups in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province, a region of strategic investment for India—particularly the Trincomalee district—poses significant security concerns. This development threatens not only Sri Lanka’s security but also India’s national security. India’s longstanding security challenges with Pakistan are intricately linked to the broader transnational threat of terrorism. South Asia has already witnessed the emergence of new jihadist groups. According to sources, many of these militant groups in South Asia draw their guidelines from al-Qaeda’s ideology and tactics, despite many being Deobandis while al-Qaeda adheres to Takfiri-Salafism. Al-Qaeda popularized the notion of Ghazwa-e-Hind to capture the imagination and loyalty of South Asian jihadists. National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ) in Sri Lanka, founded by Zaharan, and the rapidly growing Tamil Nadu Thoweed Jamath in southern India both aim to foment militant Islamic fundamentalism. These groups have maintained a relationship for over a decade, as noted by MEMRI, a Washington-based think tank on the Middle East. In this context, the growth of Islamic extremism in Sri Lanka is intrinsically linked to South Asia’s security landscape.

Pakistan’s Hostage-Rescue Failures Exposed As BLA Siege Ends In H...	Conflicting narratives and military missteps emerge from the Jaffar Express crisis in Balochistan. The recent hijacking of Pakistan's Jaffar Express by militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has ended in tragedy, exposing serious flaws in Pakistan's military preparedness and counterterrorism capabilities. While Pakistani authorities quickly declared success in ending the siege, conflicting reports from militants and independent sources have cast serious doubts on the official version, indicating higher casualties and continuing insurgent resistance. On March 11, 2025, militants belonging to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist insurgent group seeking independence for Pakistan's Balochistan province, seized control of the Jaffar Express near the Mashkaf region in Balochistan. The attackers blew up railway tracks, derailing the train, which was carrying around 440 passengers from Quetta to Peshawar, and held hundreds hostage, including Pakistani security personnel. Initially, the BLA issued a demand for a prisoner exchange, threatening to execute hostages if Pakistani authorities failed to comply within 48 hours. In response, the Pakistani military launched a large-scale operation, employing both ground forces and airstrikes. By March 12, Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military's media wing, declared the operation successfully concluded, stating all 33 insurgents had been killed, 21 passengers and four Pakistani Army personnel had died, and all hostages had been rescued. Yet, the BLA swiftly disputed this victory declaration. The insurgent group categorically rejected ISPR's claims, labelling them 'propaganda.' In an official statement, BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch said, 'The claims made by the Pakistani army spokesperson are a failed attempt to cover up lies and defeat. The ground reality is that the battle continues on multiple fronts, and the enemy is suffering heavy casualties and military losses.' Independent media reports further exposed these contradictions. Reuters, citing security sources, reported only 155 hostages were rescued initially, leaving many passengers unaccounted for. Al Jazeera corroborated that several dozen hostages remained trapped even after the Pakistani military's claimed completion of operations. Reports emerging from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, provided an even grimmer picture. Local sources indicated at least 200 coffins being prepared for Pakistani soldiers, sharply contradicting the official military casualty figures. Additionally, the BLA publicly stated that it executed 50 hostages after Pakistani authorities refused to negotiate a prisoner exchange—highlighting the tragic cost of the military's refusal to engage diplomatically with insurgents. Security experts have pointed out that Pakistan's premature declaration of victory has damaged its credibility despite unclear ground realities. Military analysts noted the complexity of this particular hostage situation, mainly due to the insurgents reportedly having suicide bombers among their ranks, posing significant challenges for rescue operations. Islamabad, known for projecting its omnipotent intelligence apparatus and substantial counterterrorism experience, was expected to conduct a swift and precise operation. However, operational delays of approximately 30 hours suggest hesitations and logistical gaps, raising doubts about the military's preparedness for such high-stakes missions. Notably, Pakistan's approach stands in contrast to global best practices in hostage rescue operations. For instance, India's National Security Guard (NSG), internationally recognised for its counterterrorism capabilities, emphasises rapid deployment, real-time intelligence integration, and precision tactics. During the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, the NSG successfully rescued over 600 hostages in a heavily contested urban environment. Even India's Railway Protection Special Force, Commando for Railway Security (CORAS), specialises in handling hostage situations involving trains, highlighting operational deficiencies within Pakistan's elite Special Services Group (SSG). Moreover, the Pakistani authorities' swift declaration of victory, without independent verification, has undermined public trust and credibility domestically and internationally. Reports of ongoing clashes and accusations by insurgents suggest that the military's narrative was an attempt at controlling the information landscape rather than accurately depicting operational realities. The broader context of the Baloch insurgency highlights that the hijacking was not an isolated incident. Balochistan remains Pakistan's poorest yet most resource-rich province, with a long history of grievances over economic marginalisation, political suppression, and human rights abuses by state forces. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multibillion-dollar infrastructure initiative, further intensified these grievances by excluding local Baloch populations from economic benefits, leading insurgent groups to increasingly target both Pakistani and Chinese personnel and assets. Since its formation in 2000, the BLA has evolved into a more potent threat. Notable attacks include the 2019 assault on Gwadar's Pearl Continental Hotel and the 2022 Karachi University suicide bombing targeting Chinese nationals. The group recently formed a unified structure under Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), aiming to launch even more coordinated offensives against Pakistani forces. This crisis has prompted renewed attention to the underlying political issues in Balochistan. Former Balochistan chief minister Akhtar Mengal recently stated, 'There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority. They have lost this war—completely and irreversibly.' Mengal's statement suggests the insurgency is evolving beyond the state's control. Human rights groups and analysts have urged Pakistan to adopt a political solution alongside military operations. History shows that purely military strategies in Balochistan have only exacerbated local resentments, fostering further insurgency. The international community, which has remained largely silent, is also urged to reassess its stance and advocate for peaceful political solutions rather than tacitly supporting a purely militaristic approach. As the immediate crisis surrounding the Jaffar Express siege concludes amid confusion and controversy, deeper questions linger about Pakistan's broader counterinsurgency strategy and its repeated reliance on military solutions. The government's unwillingness to negotiate, combined with the military's mishandling of the operation and conflicting public claims, reveals a troubling lack of transparency and readiness to protect its citizens effectively. If the Pakistani state continues to prioritise military force over political dialogue, experts warn that the violence will escalate further, perpetuating instability and putting civilians at even greater risk. The recent siege stresses the critical need for Pakistan to rethink its approach to counterinsurgency—balancing security measures with genuine political reconciliation and respect for human rights. Unless such reforms are implemented promptly, Balochistan is likely to remain a flashpoint of conflict where both civilians and soldiers continue to pay the ultimate price.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6upjQa2cF4Wlj	2025-03-14T17:21:06-07:00	
Iran And The Price Of The ANC’s Nostalgia – Analysis	The African National Congress’ friendship with Tehran is becoming the main bugbear in US relations with South Africa. By Peter Fabricius Back in 2022 and 2023 after Russia invaded Ukraine and Pretoria refused to condemn Moscow, South Africa’s friendly relations with Russia were the most toxic in Western, especially United States’ (US) eyes. But US President Donald Trump has turned the world on its head by blaming Ukraine for allowing itself to be invaded, a position that aligns with Russia’s narrative about the war. Now South Africa’s ties with Iran are emerging as the most damaging to its relations with the US. Trump’s hostility to South Africa became official in an executive order terminating all US aid to the country, partly because of its new Expropriation Act but also because of South Africa’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) case against Israel, and its ‘[reinvigorated] relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.’ Pretoria has been trying to avoid a complete breakdown in its relationship with the US, largely to protect its lucrative duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The recent aid cuts also pose a significant risk to South Africa, especially its already ailing health sector. Despite this, the African National Congress (ANC) – the major partner in South Africa’s government of national unity – is actively promoting its good relations with Iran. Last week Nomvula Mokonyane, the ANC’s Deputy Secretary-General and Blade Nzimande, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, both separately hosted Iranian Ambassador to South Africa, Mansour Shakib Mehr, describing their relationship with Tehran as ‘warm and cordial.’ Despite US concerns and recent aid cuts, the ANC is actively promoting its good relations with Iran This undoubtedly added grist to the mills of South Africa’s many enemies in the US, who have had Pretoria’s relations with Iran in their sights for some time. The US embassy in Pretoria warned South Africa about possible sanctions when two Iranian warships docked in Cape Town in early 2023. South Africa’s relations with Iran came under scrutiny after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, which Iran openly supports. On 22 October, South Africa’s then foreign minister Naledi Pandor visited Tehran and met then president Ebrahim Raisi. At the time, foreign affairs officials told ISS Today she had among other things, delivered an invitation from Ramaphosa to visit South Africa, but that the visit had been called off. And then in January 2024, the ANC – which had been flirting with insolvency for years – announced it had managed to stabilise its finances without explaining how. Just days earlier, South Africa had charged Israel with genocide in Gaza before the ICJ. The timing raised suspicions, and a few commentators opined that Iran had paid off the ANC for taking Israel to court. The ANC and government denied this. A Daily Maverick fact check found no evidence of a payoff but concluded that the charges could not be proven or disproven, largely because the ANC accounts were not public. The ANC also aroused suspicion by hosting Hamas leaders for a Palestinian solidarity convention in South Africa shortly after the group attacked Israel. The ANC often seems to invite suspicion about its dealings with Iran and Hamas. Statements by top ANC executive and Minister of Mineral and Petroleum Resources, Gwede Mantashe – just days after Trump cut aid to South Africa this year – are a good example. He said Iran and Russia were both welcome to bid for South Africa’s planned contract to build a nuclear reactor to add 2 500 megawatts to the electricity. Trump is overreacting to SA’s positions, but countries shouldn’t be surprised if they are judged by the company they keep Yet, as Isabel Bosman, a Researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), told ISS Today, Iran has no known capacity or track record of building nuclear power stations abroad. She said Iran had required Russian assistance even to build its own nuclear power station. The fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency warned this month that Tehran is moving closer to being able to build nuclear weapons, has not helped South Africa’s cause. Even though, as Bosman says, there’s no evidence of any nuclear cooperation between the two countries. Chrispin Phiri, Spokesperson for South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola told ISS Today: ‘Regarding the baseless allegations of nuclear collaboration, we resolutely uphold the principle that nuclear weapons have no legitimate place in our shared future. South Africa remains unwavering in its dedication to international initiatives designed to curtail the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.’ It appears that the ANC is just being true to an old struggle-era ally, as it does with Cuba, Venezuela and Russia. (Even if, as Ukraine points out, the ANC’s struggle ally was the USSR not Russia, and Ukraine was part of the USSR.) South Africa and Iran’s official relationship goes back to the dawn of democracy when a Joint Commission of Cooperation was formed in 1995, and has met regularly ever since. But as Steve Gruzd, Head of the African Governance and Diplomacy Programme at SAIIA notes, the ANC’s relationship with Iran is even older than that and ‘when the ANC makes a friend, it's almost a friend for life and all sins are forgiven thereafter…’. He told ISS Today the ANC had admired Iran since the 1979 revolution, and that it falls into the category of ANC friends that ‘are not popular in the West.’ Is the rest of South Africa paying too high a price for the ANC’s revolutionary nostalgia? Gruzd notes that South Africa has defended Iran at the United Nations for its right to run a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes. He also said that the South African cellphone provider MTN is heavily invested in Iran, with a 49% share in one of the main cellphone companies. Yet it’s clear that national economic interests do not drive the relationship as total trade between the two countries barely reached R300 million in 2023. It is curious that the ANC is so friendly with Hamas’ main sponsor and Hamas itself, which is dedicated to a one-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Officially, the ANC still supports a two-state solution and is closer to the Palestine Liberation Organization – the co-architect of the two-state solution – than to Hamas. Phiri observes that ‘The narrative framing South Africa’s relationship with Iran echoes the now-discarded narrative towards Russia. Take for example [US] Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio’s statement on Russia relations – it refers to 'a commitment to restore a respectful and constructive interstate dialogue with Russia'’. Phiri adds that ‘As a sovereign state, South Africa unequivocally reserves the right to engage in dialogue founded on mutual respect and constructive intent with any nation, in alignment with its principles and national interests.’ That is of course true. It is also true that Trump is grossly overreacting to South Africa’s actions and positions. But countries should not be surprised if they are judged by the company they keep. Iran sponsors Hamas and Hezbollah to attack Israel, supplies drones to Russia to attack Ukraine and appears to be close to building nuclear weapons. As with other old ANC chums like Russia, one has to ask whether the rest of South Africa is paying too high a price for the ANC’s revolutionary nostalgia.

Russian Influence Operations In Georgia: A Threat To Democracy An...	By Vasil Sikharulidze (FPRI) -- Russia’s influence operations in Georgia represent one of the Black Sea region’s most comprehensive hybrid warfare campaigns. The Kremlin has employed military intervention and territorial occupation, economic embargos, energy leverages, political co-optation, corruption, and information warfare. The Kremlin’s objective is clear: to undermine Georgia’s statehood and derail the country from its democratic and economic development and Euro-Atlantic integration path, as well as entrench Russian strategic dominance. While Russia’s military occupation of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali remains a direct challenge to Georgia’s sovereignty, Moscow has expanded its influence through political co-optation, economic dependency, and information warfare. In Georgia, Russia has penetrated the ruling elite, manipulated public discourse, and fostered internal divisions, allowing it to exert control without open military action but with deeply embedded instruments of influence. While Georgia has demonstrated strong public resistance to these efforts, the growing authoritarian tendencies of its ruling elites—aided by Russian interference—pose a severe risk to the country’s future. Security Dimension To understand Russia’s influence in Georgia, we must begin with the security dimension. In 2008, Russia launched an open military invasion of Georgia. Currently, in violation of the EU-mediated ceasefire, Russia continues to occupy 20 percent of Georgia’s territory, establishing permanent military bases in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali. This occupation is a deliberate instrument of coercion aimed at limiting Georgia’s strategic choices. One of Russia’s hybrid tactics is 'borderization'—the gradual shifting of the occupation line deeper into Georgian-controlled territory. This tactic fosters insecurity, keeps border communities under constant pressure, disrupts local economies, and tests Western reactions. However, Russia’s influence in Georgia extends far beyond military pressure. Since 2012, following the electoral victory of the Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia Party (GD), founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili (a billionaire with deep ties to Russia), Georgia’s political alignment has gradually shifted as a result of Kremlin narratives and financial incentives. It has accelerated in recent years, most actively after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. What began as a 'normalization policy' with Russia has evolved into a systemic rollback of democratic institutions and growing alignment with Kremlin objectives. Eventually, it developed into a Kleptocratic authoritarian governance system that had many similarities to the Kremlin regime. Another key turning point came in 2023 when the European Union granted Georgia candidate status. Instead of embracing this historic opportunity, the ruling party reintroduced the Russian-style 'Foreign Agents’ law,' a measure designed to silence civil society and independent media. This move sparked massive protests that were met with brutality from the government. Yet the government doubled down on Kremlin-style rhetoric, accusing the West of orchestrating unrest and attempting to drug Georgia into the war with Russia. The GD party even came up with a unique conspiracy theory of the 'Global War Party,' framing all critics as part of this 'party' that was pushing Georgia towards war. GD has echoed Moscow’s narrative on the 2008 war, blaming past Georgian leaders instead of Russia. The Kremlin’s propaganda promotes appeasement as the path to stability while portraying the West as a disruptor. Economic Leverages Beyond security and politics, Russia maintains substantial economic leverage over Georgia through trade dependencies, energy supply, and penetration into Georgia’s financial System. Despite a trade embargo from Russia that started in 2006, Georgia had remarkable economic growth thanks to effective economic and governance reforms undertaken. Georgian exports to Russia resumed in 2013. Despite Georgia’s stated policy of economic diversification, trade data shows a steady increase in economic ties with Russia. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the structure of Russian business activities in Georgia underwent significant changes. Large Russian enterprises were compelled to exit the market, leading to a rise in small and medium-sized enterprises. Given that 38 percent of foreign investments in Georgia originate from offshore zones, accurately assessing the extent of Russian oligarchic influence remains challenging. In 2022, Russian foreign direct investment in Georgia reached a record $105.6 million, followed by a slight decline to $103.3 million in 2023. This increase has raised concerns among policymakers regarding Georgia’s long-term economic sovereignty. A particularly notable trend is the surge in real estate acquisitions by Russian citizens, which grew by 115 percent between 2022 and 2023, raising concerns about financial penetration and long-term economic influence. In 2023, the officially recorded trade turnover between Georgia and Russia reached $2.39 billion—a 47 percent increase compared to 2021, the year before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s share of Georgia’s total trade turnover fluctuated over the past three years, rising from 11.4 percent in 2021 to 13.1 percent in 2022 before declining to 11.2 percent in 2023. This increasing economic interdependence poses risks, particularly for Georgian manufacturers who face growing competition from Russian imports, which now constitute approximately 39 percent of Georgia’s total imports. Energy Dependence: A Strategic Vulnerability Georgia’s dependency on Russian natural gas remains very low—Georgia mainly relies on natural gas from Azerbaijan since the 2006 South Caucasus Pipeline (or the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum Pipeline). While Georgia receives natural gas from Azerbaijan, Russian pricing mechanisms remain opaque, raising concerns about potential energy coercion. However, Georgia has become heavily dependent on Russia for liquefied petroleum gas controlled by Moscow-backed enterprises. Furthermore, Georgia relies entirely on imported petroleum, and current trends show that Georgia is becoming more dependent on Russian oil products such as gasoline and diesel again, which wasn’t the case a few years ago. In 2023, Russian fuel imports declined by 11 percent ($70 million) due to supply disruptions, but overall, Georgia’s dependence on Russian petroleum has increased since 2021. One of the most concerning aspects of Georgia’s energy policy is the absence of a strategic gas reserve, which places the country at risk of severe supply disruptions. Despite receiving €120 million in funding from European institutions for the construction of a strategic reserve, the Georgian government redirected these funds during the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying the project until 2025. As a result, Georgia remains the only country in the region without a strategic gas storage facility, making it highly vulnerable to supply shocks and potential Russian coercion. Strategic Connectivity and the Anaklia Deep-Sea Port Georgia’s geostrategic position makes it a vital link between Europe and Central Asia, with great potential for strategic connectivity crucial for trade, energy, and transportation. By bypassing Russia, this network may reduce Moscow’s leverage over regional commerce and strengthen economic ties between Central Asia and Europe, contributing to EU energy security. The Anaklia Deep-Sea Port was designed to enhance Georgia’s role as a key transit hub, attract Western investment, and integrate the country into global supply chains. However, the GD government undermined the project by canceling contracts, delaying implementation, and handing it over to a Chinese firm. This move sidelined Western investment and raised concerns about Chinese and Russian influence over Georgia’s infrastructure. By obstructing Anaklia, the government weakened Georgia’s strategic connectivity, reinforcing economic dependencies that serve Moscow’s interests. The project’s failure highlights how political decisions, influenced by pro-Russian narratives and geopolitical pressures, continue to limit Georgia’s long-term economic potential. Soft Power: Intelligence & Propaganda Networks Russia has systematically invested in propaganda, disinformation, political influence, and intelligence penetration in Georgia. Beyond economic dependencies, Moscow has developed a multi-layered soft-power network designed to shape public discourse, foster pro-Kremlin sentiments, and undermine Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic integration. One of the key pillars of Russia’s influence strategy is disinformation and media control. Kremlin-backed media outlets, troll farms, and social media networks actively disseminate anti-Western narratives, portraying European and NATO integration as threats to Georgia’s sovereignty and traditional values. These efforts promote the notion that Russia is Georgia’s natural economic and security partner, reinforcing dependence on Moscow. The penetration of these narratives extends beyond media platforms into Georgia’s political landscape, where the GD political class echoes Kremlin rhetoric opposing NATO and EU integration. A particularly concerning development is the role of the GD party in advancing anti-Western narratives. Over time, the ruling party has cultivated a distinctly anti-American and anti-European political rhetoric that closely mirrors Kremlin propaganda. GD leaders and affiliated media outlets routinely claim that the West seeks to destabilize Georgia, interfere in its domestic affairs, and push the country into war with Russia. These accusations, similar to narratives promoted by Russian state media, serve to discredit Georgia’s Western allies and undermine public support for European and NATO integration. The party has also employed fear-based messaging by portraying Western engagement as a direct threat to Georgia’s sovereignty while simultaneously advocating for 'sovereign democracy'—a concept aligned with Moscow’s ideological framework, which rejects Western democratic models in favor of state-controlled governance. Moscow has also cultivated an extensive network of non-governmental organizations and intelligence-linked entities to advance its strategic objectives. Investigative reports indicate that at least tens of pro-Russian organizations operate in Georgia, engaging in activities that whitewash Moscow’s aggression, downplay the occupation of Georgian territories, and propagate anti-Western propaganda. These organizations not only shape public opinion but serve as instruments for intelligence gathering, political lobbying, and electoral interference. The depth of Russian influence within Georgia’s political elite was starkly revealed in April 2024 when Ivanishvili claimed that Russia’s invasions of Georgia and Ukraine were orchestrated by a 'Global War Party' in the West. Similarly, statements from Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze suggesting that external forces control the United States and the European Union further illustrate the extent to which Kremlin-aligned narratives have been internalized within the ruling establishment. These statements reflect a broader effort to shift public opinion away from Western integration and to normalize closer ties with Moscow. Beyond political and media influence, Russia uses economic and financial tools to expand its presence in Georgia. State-controlled businesses serve strategic interests, while covert funding supports pro-Russian parties, civil groups, and media outlets that amplify Kremlin propaganda. These resources also fuel electoral interference, shaping Georgia’s political trajectory. In the digital sphere, Russian troll factories and media networks manipulate public perception, particularly during elections. They discredit Western alliances, promote pro-Kremlin narratives, and compete with national broadcasters. The GD party and its affiliates play a key role in this information warfare, pushing anti-Western rhetoric, revisionist history on the 2008 war, and policies that weaken Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic ties. The 2024 Elections and Public Protests The October 26, 2024, parliamentary elections marked a major setback for Georgia’s democracy. Independent observers, including the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association, and international monitors, documented widespread electoral fraud, including voter intimidation, ballot stuffing, vote secrecy breaches, and suppression of election observers. Despite clear evidence of fraud, the Central Election Commission declared GD victorious with 54 percent, an outcome immediately rejected by opposition parties, civil society, and international observers. While the European Union and United States refused to recognize the results, Russia and other pro-Kremlin leaders endorsed them, reinforcing Georgia’s political shift toward Moscow. Mass protests erupted, now lasting for over eighty-five consecutive days, making them one of Georgia’s longest-running resistance movements. The government responded with Kremlin-style repression, including brutal police crackdowns with mass detentions and arrests, beating and torturing detainees, and smear campaigns labeling protesters as 'foreign agents.' In a further escalation, Ivanishvili’s regime enacted draconian legislation that violates fundamental rights, including freedom of assembly, expression, and due process. It also uses financial pressure as a tool of political suppression. Just one example is the weaponization of financial penalties against protesters. Authorities introduced harsh new fines of 5,000 GEL—a crippling sum in a country where the average pension is 350 GEL and salaries average 1,000 GEL. More than fifty political prisoners remain detained while a politically controlled judiciary rubber-stamps these penalties. By criminalizing peaceful protest, the GD consolidates its authoritarian rule, erodes democratic norms, and distances Georgia from its European aspirations. Despite repression, public resistance remains strong, marking a defining moment in Georgia’s democratic struggle. Georgia stands at a crossroads, facing a choice between preserving its sovereignty and the Euro-Atlantic path or falling deeper under Moscow’s influence. The resilience of the Georgian people and international support will be critical in shaping its future. Russia’s influence strategy in Georgia is comprehensive, integrating political, economic, and informational tools to weaken sovereignty and entrench dependence. By portraying closer ties with Moscow as necessary for stability, the Kremlin aims to consolidate its regional dominance. Georgia’s subordination is central to Russia’s broader revisionist ambitions in the South Caucasus. The Global Danger of Russian Influence Operations Russia’s hybrid warfare—propaganda, disinformation, corruption, and political subversion—extends far beyond Georgia. These tactics target democratic societies worldwide, eroding trust in institutions and manipulating political discourse. The same elite capture, economic coercion, and divisive narratives used in Georgia are actively deployed against Europe and North America. This challenge does not require military confrontation: It works silently, destabilizing democracies from within. Western nations have already faced election interference, cyber-attacks, and disinformation campaigns designed to fragment societies and weaken strategic cohesion. Addressing this threat demands urgent, coordinated action from NATO, the European Union, and democratic allies. Strengthening resilience, transparency, and counter-disinformation efforts is essential. Georgia’s experience is a warning: If left unchecked, Russia’s tactics will be replicated elsewhere.

Russia Plans To Turn Belarus Into Launching Pad For Intermediate-...	By Alexander Taranov On December 6, 2024, during a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State in Minsk, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) (Kremlin.ru, December 6, 2024). This deployment is planned for the second half of 2025 on Belarusian territory. As in the case of the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, this decision was purportedly made in response to a request from Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka (Belta.by, January 26). Putin justified his decision by referencing Russia’s obligations under the Treaty on Security Guarantees within the Union State, positioning it as a measure to ensure Belarus’s security against potential North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aggression (see EDM, February 12, 13). In March 2023, Lukashenka mentioned the possibility of Russian strategic missile systems being placed in Belarus. He stated that discussions were ongoing with the Kremlin regarding the potential deployment of Russian strategic nuclear weapons, specifically the RT-2PM2 Topol-M ground-based missile systems (GBMS) (President of the Republic of Belarus, March 31, 2023). In April 2023, Belarusian Armed Forces undertook first measures to restore and modernize Soviet-era infrastructure in Brest oblast, specifically the launch sites for the RT-2PM Topol GBMS (Telegram/@modmilby, April 23, 2023; (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, April 24, 2023). Belarusian officials have indicated that Minsk still lacks complete information about the specific parameters and plan of Russia’s deployment of the Oreshnik missile system (MS) in Belarus. For instance, Lukashenka instructed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Belarus to facilitate the deployment of the Russian Oreshnik MS in the country and carefully plan its combat use. According to Chief Major General Pavel Muraveiko, however, the Belarusian side has not been informed about the number of Oreshnik MS launchers that Russia will deploy in Belarus. Only the President of Russia knows this (Belta.by, December 12, 2024). Representatives of the top military-political leadership are addressing public concerns about this decision, which increases military dependence on Russia and affects Belarus’s sovereignty. In response, Lukashenka denied that Belarus is losing sovereignty to Russia. Contrary to his latest moves, he specifically stated that there is no 'Russian occupation' of Belarus and that such a situation will not occur as long as he remains the leader of the country (Reform.news, December 10, 2024; see EDM, February 12, 13). Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Belarus, Colonel Sergei Lagodzyuk, explains the decision to deploy the Oreshnik MS as a response to the deployment of similar U.S. medium-range weapons in Europe, the militarization of the region, Russia’s war against Ukraine, as well as an information campaign 'launched against Belarus to discredit the authorities and the leadership of the country to create conditions for the emergence or provocation of conflicts' ( Belta.by, December 12, 2024). The military-political leadership of Belarus believes that the MSs will produce a deterrent effect, such as nuclear weapons already on Belarusian territory, and will become a serious obstacle to potential aggression from NATO (Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus, December 7, 2024). The commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Colonel General Sergei Karakaev, explained that the Russian military command is only working on a decision to create new formations of the Strategic Missile Forces for a new medium-range missile system (TASS, December 16, 2024). The Oreshnik MS will be part of the Strategic Missile Forces of the Russian Armed Forces (RAF). In the event of deployment on the territory of Belarus, these systems will also be subordinate to the Main Staff of the RAF Strategic Missile Forces and/or the Joint Command of the Regional Troops Grouping (RTG) of Russia and Belarus, in which the Russian side dominates in the decision-making process, and the Belarusian side only has the right to an advisory vote (see EDM, February 3, 13). Lukashenka himself claims that, by agreement with Moscow, the military-political leadership of Belarus will select the targets for strikes with the Oreshnik MS (Belta.by, December 10, 2024; see EDM, February 3). He also stated that the military of the RAF will only service and carry out launches on certain targets, while and until Russian specialists train Belarusian military personnel (Belta.by, December 12, 2024). He also publicly confirmed the involvement of Belarus in the creation of this system, in particular the provision of chassis for its launchers manufactured by the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant, or MZKT. In his words, Belarus needs 'only missiles' from Russia, and Belarus will allegedly create the chassis and launchers itself (Belta.by, December 10, 2024). Specifically, in the first nine months of 2024, MZKT sent 36 railcars with equipment and components to the Federal Research and Production Center 'Titan-Barricady' (Volgograd), one of co-producers of the Oreshnik MS (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, November 22, 2024). Some Russian military experts estimate that it is preferable to launch the Oreshnik IRBMs from locations in Belarus that are protected from a direct disarming strike. The areas around the cities of Mogilev and Bobruisk in Mogilev oblast are considered suitable for its deployment due to adequate forests, low population density, existing airfields, roads, railways, air defense coverage, and proximity to the Russian border. Consequently, it will be challenging for U.S. ATACMS to target these locations. Deploying the Oreshnik IRBM further west, however, could be risky, as the missiles would become vulnerable to enemy air defense systems during their initial flight trajectory. According to Russian military experts, 8–12 launchers of Oreshnik MS can be placed at two sites, which is equivalent to a full-fledged missile regiment of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces (Topcor.ru, December 17, 2024). Another potential site for the deployment of the Oreshnik MS may be the village of Cheretyanka in Gomel oblast, where the abandoned base of the 369th missile regiment of the Strategic Missile Forces was located during Soviet times. A delegation of the RTG Joint Command visited it in June 2022 with an unclear inspection. In Soviet times, the RSD-10 Pioneer missile system and the RT-2PM Topol strategic missile system were based on it. Near and on the base’s territory, there is all the necessary infrastructure, including a platform for unloading nuclear missiles, a railway, boiler houses, barracks and warehouses, although in poor condition (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, June 12, 2022). Considering these infrastructural requirements for the deployment, it can be assumed that in Mogilev oblast, Oreshnik can be placed in areas between Chausy, Krichev and Cherikov, on one hand, as well as Krichev, Bykhov, and Kirovsky, on the other. This deployment seems to be based on the assumption that Ukraine will not strike these targets. Practically, however, the Ukrainian Armed Forces can easily destroy Oreshnik IRBMs in those areas (The Kyiv Independent, November 24, 2024). Lukashenka confirmed on December 26 that he wants to receive 10 units of the Oreshnik IRBM from Russia and deploy them closer to the Smolensk oblast of Russia, which borders Belarus (Reform.news, December 26, 2024, January 26). References to Russia’s neighboring regions likely concern Russian Strategic Missile Forces’ combat duty crews operating in Belarus, frequently changing routes and positions. Permanent deployment points may appear in Russia’s Smolensk oblast, while temporary deployment points could be set up in Belarus’s Mogilev and Gomel oblasts. The deployment of the Oreshnik IRBMs, even in the Mogilev oblast, does not guarantee bypassing the U.S./NATO missile defense systems in Redzikowo, Poland and Deveselu, Romania in the SM-3 Block IIA version (NATO, July 10, 2024). The direct distance from Mogilev to these facilities is 850 kilometers (530 miles) and 1,170 kilometers (730 miles), respectively. There is only one military scenario for using the Oreshnik IRBMs from the territory of Belarus. This scenario involves the preemptive destruction of U.S./NATO missile defense bases in Poland and Romania as a result of a massive missile attack and/or the use of tactical nuclear weapons to destroy them. After that, the Oreshnik IRBMs can be used from the territory of Belarus against targets in Europe without the threat of interception by missile defense systems. Such a scenario is possible if Russian leadership designs plans for a vertical escalation of the conflict with Ukraine to a regional war with NATO in the European theater of war. For this reason, Russia plans to expand the tactical nuclear weapon carrier supply to Belarus. In particular, since June 2024, two new hangars have been built on the territory of military unit No 12147 in Osipovichi—where the 465th Missile Brigade of the Armed Forces of Belarus is located—for the new Iskander-M operational-tactical missile systems. In size and appearance, the hangars are similar to those shelters for the MS, built here two years ago (Svaboda.org, June 7, 2024). The missile brigade itself is located 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from one of the alleged locations for Russian tactical nuclear weapons in the Balshaya Garozha village on the territory of the 1405th Artillery Ammunition Base (see EDM, April 30, 2024). Each of the hangars can accommodate 12 combat vehicles. In February 2024, Lukashenka mentioned that there were already two battalions of the Iskander-M MS in Belarus (RIA Novosti, February 20, 2024). Construction activities testify that a new missile brigade armed with the Iskander-M MS will be formed in Belarus. In this case, the total number of tactical nuclear weapon carrier launchers will reach 12 units in the near future in the missile brigade (Belarusinfocus.pro, June 9, 2024). At the same time, the Russian military-industrial complex is already modifying missiles for this system with a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) (Militaryrussia.ru, July 24, 2024). In this regard, Putin also mentioned Belarus regarding additional deliveries of long-range missile weapons and speculated about Russia’s right to supply similar weapons to the West’s opponents (TASS, June 7, 2024). By the end of 2025, Russia will additionally deploy missile systems with a maximum range of 1,000 to 6,000 kilometers (621 to 3,728 miles) on the territory of Belarus. It is not ruled out that an additional batch of Iskander-M as well as Oreshnik missile systems will also arrive in Belarus in connection with preparations for the Zapad-2025 strategic maneuvers and will remain permanently there, as it happened after the Soyuznaya Reshimost-2022 exercise (Interfax.ru, May 10, 2022; see EDM, November 7, November 18, 2024). The deployment of such systems so close to NATO’s eastern flank, a potential theater of operations, indicates that Russia and Belarus are preparing for scenarios of preemptive missile strikes against critical, military and logistical infrastructure in Europe both in conventional and nuclear versions. Investments in advanced missile defense and long-range strike capabilities by Ukraine and NATO could mitigate the threats coming from Russian missile systems’ deployment in Belarus.

Syria’s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham: The Jungle And The Leopard – OpEd	By Fernando Carvajal Events in Syria continue to evolve at lightspeed. In December 2024, regional and Western governments rushed to engage the new al-Qaeda-affiliated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) government, which is supported by NATO member Turkey. Jubilation intoxicated the general population and the diaspora following the anticlimactic fall of the Assad regime. Nearly three months later, the honeymoon has run its course and the jungle holds on to the spots. After the regressive series of events following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, regional and Western powers wait to see if the HTS government leaders can truly change their spots, as they traded fatigues for designer suits. The region has witnessed the chaos following the fall of notorious Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and most recently the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. In both cases, the region experienced a series of events where al-Qaeda and ISIS gained a lifeline, and women and minorities suffered from tremendous regressive policies under corrupt and extremist regimes. Damascus, the first Arab capital governed by self-made extremists listed as terrorists by the international community, surfaced as a unique case. In contrast to other extremist groups, HTS leaders immediately launched a well-coordinated 'charm offensive' and presented themselves as statesmen, surrounded by a jungle of militants marginalized by the victors, and away from the spoils. HTS leaders and their patrons aim to convince the world they’ve changed their spots. Can the jungle let it last? This is a loaded question. First, the international community must wait and see where the approach to de-radicalization since the September 11 attacks failed and the revolutionary spirit achieves change. The world waits to see the difference between al-Qaeda ideologues and their former hosts: the Taliban and ISIS. The experiment also raises the stakes for the Muslim Brotherhood — can it succeed in Damascus where it failed in Cairo? Damascus and the jungle On January 29, 2025, the HTS leadership gathered to confirm Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani (now Ahmed al-Shar’a) during a symbolic bay’a — Islamic oath of allegiance to a leader — summit in Damascus. Civilian and military loyalists gathered to consolidate the image of the State, but this was as much a message to rival Islamist factions as it was to international audiences. Under overt guidance and with material support from Turkey, the HTS government moved quickly to address a major obstacle to international legitimacy, removal from terrorist lists by the United States, European Union and United Nations. The new rulers in Damascus also need to consolidate authority and power over rival factions, ethnic minority groups, former regime remnants and hostile neighbors like Iran, Iraq and Israel. While HTS does not yet control all of Syria’s territory, it is relying on an extensive network of Islamist militants to deter fragmentation. Jawlani’s chess game smartly moved toward Iraq, where it hosted a meeting with former enemies in neighboring intelligence services. The meeting with Hamid al-Shatri, Head of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, aimed to mend fences from Jawlani’s ISIS days. It also sought to strengthen the rear front to prevent new incursions by Iran-affiliated militias and elements of Lebanon’s Hezbollah paramilitary group. By meeting with Iraqi intelligence rather than diplomats, Jawlani signaled a merging of interests with Turkey. More interesting, and of higher risk for HTS, has been the reported collaboration with the US. A US State Department delegation visited Damascus in late December 2024. Soon after, a report emerged of possible intelligence sharing between Washington and HTS leadership. The meeting with Iraq officials and sharing of intelligence with the US seems like a carrot from Turkey to sweeten up the deal with Damascus. US strikes against ISIS and al-Qaeda elements serve Jawlani’s interests as much as the West’s. Members of jihadist groups from the jungle resisting Jawlani’s authority may turn on Damascus, derail HTS governance and attract negative attention. Enemies inside and outside pose as much threat as the inability to govern a highly diverse Syrian environment. HTS’s move from a jihadist militant group to a government entity complicates funding. Damascus no longer must simply fund a patronage network of jihadists. As a central government, HTS must provide costly services beyond the center, beyond security. Collection of taxes beyond their safe haven in the city of Idlib is no longer a model, neither are 'extortion, kidnapping and oil-smuggling … [or] at least $94 million from prisoner-exchange deals with the Syrian government, Iran, Lebanon and Italy.' Damascus needs a deal with Kurds for access to oil supplies. This requires a delicate balance as Turkey lies in the middle of an agreement with them. Can the leopard change its spots? Just as Afghanistan under the Taliban, the potential for Syria to surface as a new safe haven for jihadist militants is a primary concern for the region and the West. Every militant group is bound to experience a struggle for power, and Jawlani is at the center. As he switches from jihadist field commander to head of state, he must guard his generals as much as rivals among militant factions beyond the center. It is still unclear how power will project beyond the core. Likewise, no one knows what role Jawlani’s loyalists will play. Security and State revenue beyond Damascus will undoubtedly depend on stability in areas with Shia, Druze, Kurdish and Yazidi populations. Relations with minority groups will test the ability to govern and the degree to which Islamist extremists can change their spots. Jawlani has spoken the magic words for the West and pointed to elections being held around five years from now.

Trump’s Presidential Diplomacy Is Surging – OpEd	The US President Donald Trump by far outstrips any of his predecessors in post-cold war era in the transparency of his foreign policy agenda and in his attempt to connect the public opinion with his America First ideology. Trump’s presidential diplomacy depends heavily on his media briefings, which have become a daily occurrence and are an absolute ‘must’ for any serious analyst or observer of world affairs. Trump’s press conference at the White House on Thursday during the visit of the NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte stood out for the following signposts in the US foreign policy agenda that he planted in a 48-minute event alone. One. Whereas the expectation was that Rutte’s visit was just the right occasion for Trump to bring the western alliance to the centre stage of his foreign policy and reclaim the leadership of the transatlantic alliance 'to project American power' (Rutte’s words), he was instead simply uninterested in NATO — although Rutte praised him sky-high for his contribution to making the alliance a 'strong' organisation by boosting its budget. Two. On the contrary, Trump spoke at length on the Ukraine peace process and expressed hope that the war is ending, taking even a swipe at NATO for having squandered its budget wastefully under the Biden presidency by intervening in a war that should not have happened. By the way, Rutte is known to be a super hawk on Russia (which actually inspired President Biden to handpick him for the present job late last year.) Rutte was a prominent fixture in the family photos of the recent string of EU summits that were pioneered by French President Emmanuel Macron to choreograph the future trajectory of the Ukraine war against the backdrop of the perceived US retrenchment in Europe, Three. Trump taunted Rutte openly by proposing that the latter could be 'instrumental' in his hugely controversial foreign policy venture to annex Greenland, which Denmark, a NATO country, claims as its integral part. Trump severely questioned the basis of the claim by Denmark to Greenland. Rutte tried to change the topic but Trump would have none of it and reminded him of NATO’s 'relevance'. To be sure, NATO finds itself like a cat on a hot tin roof if Trump’s strong hint of a likely boost in the US troop deployment in its two existing bases in Greenland goes ahead which will be tantamount to an annexation by military means, something Denmark will be hardly in a position to counter. Trump spoke in the presence of Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Four. Trump point blank rejected the narrative that Russia posed a military threat to Europe and that Russian victory in Ukraine will encourage Moscow to attack European states. Arguably, Trump’s ‘nyet’ not only knocks the bottom out of the legitimacy of the NATO and Europe’s intervention in Ukraine but also casts doubts on the raison d’être of the NATO. (Earlier in his remarks, Rutte had spoken forcefully of the imperative need to swiftly build up Europe’s defence industry to meet the Russian threat.) Five. Trump hinted that he may resume talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, which he began in the first term but got derailed as his presidency increasingly came under siege from the deep state and the neocon lobby with the support of the Democratic Party. A resumption of the US-DPRK talks can potentially realign the security alliance matrix in Northeast Asia and impact the US’ Indo-Pacific strategy on the whole. Six. Most important, Trump disclosed that much serious discussion had been taking place with Ukraine, including on the seemingly intractable territorial issues and the future status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in southeastern Ukraine, which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and among the 10 largest in the world, and has been under Russian control since 2022. Trump said, 'We’ve been discussing land with Ukraine… pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement. You know, we’ve been discussing concepts of land because you don’t want to waste time with a ceasefire if it’s not going to mean anything, They discussed (in Jeddah) NATO and being in NATO, and everybody knows what the answer to that is. They’ve known that answer for 40 years, in all fairness.' Trump seemed to suggest that conditions have been created for holding serious negotiations with Russia going forward. Trump spoke with great deliberation in Rutte’s presence, knowing that European capitals would be keenly listening. Suffice to say, Trump has left the US’ European allies in no doubt that he is the new sheriff in town and there are no two ways about it. Trump has shown no interest in Western troop deployment in Ukraine; nor does he envisage any European participation in the US-Russia dialogue. Trump sees this as a deal between him and Putin and sounded confident that Russia’s concerns can be properly addressed. However, it is doubtful whether the Russian side also sees the situation in such binary terms. If Putin’s address to the Russian Foreign Ministry last June (spelling out the conditions to be fulfilled before talks commenced) is applied as the yardstick today, there is a long winding road ahead. Indeed, there is much scepticism in Moscow even about Ukraine’s sudden turnaround on ceasefire. Russians see it as a tactical ploy to wriggle out of the devastating rout that thousands of its elite troops are facing in Kursk at the moment, and nothing more. At the press conference, Trump touched on Putin’s statement on March 13 and said that the latter 'put out a very promising statement, but it wasn’t complete. And, yeah, I’d love to meet with him or talk to him.' Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff met Putin on Thursday to discuss the results of US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week and to relay Moscow’s position back to Washington. based on Witkoff’s feedback from Moscow, Trump has since written on Truth Social, 'We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end — BUT, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!' In televised remarks later, Putin responded to Trump’s ‘demarche’ regarding the fate of Ukrainian troops. He said, 'We are sympathetic to President Trump’s call. If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment.' Trump had stated during the press conference yesterday that the US has already discussed many details of a potential 'final agreement' with Kiev and is now waiting to see 'whether or not Russia is there.' Apparently, Trump is conveying the impression that the latest signal from Witkoff’s meeting last night with Putin is that Russia is coming on board. However, appearances can be deceptive in such situations of smoke and mirrors in international diplomacy. A close reading of Putin’s statement of March 13 reveals that while Russia is, in principle, open to the US’ call for ceasefire, Moscow has serious reservations, and several questions remain to be answered. The ball is, arguably, in Trump’s court now, contrary to Washington’s facile argument. Suffice to say, the US-Russia dialogue appears to be at an inflection point.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uszy4Mi_i3JL	2025-03-14T17:12:31-07:00	
Kra Canal: The Impossible Dream Of Southeast Asia Shipping – Anal...	By Paulo Aguiar The idea of the Kra Canal has been a topic of discussion for centuries, as the promise of an alternative route between the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand could revolutionize shipping and reshape regional geopolitics. While the project has never come to fruition, its potential impact keeps it in strategic conversations, particularly in light of China’s expanding influence in Southeast Asia and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As of now, Thailand has opted for a different path, but debates over the canal’s feasibility and geopolitical consequences remain very much alive. Historical Background The concept of the Kra Canal dates back to 1677 when Thai King Narai commissioned French engineer de Lamar to survey the Kra Isthmus for a possible canal. At the time, the idea was not to connect the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea but rather to establish a navigable waterway between Songkhla and Marid (now Myanmar). De Lamar’s assessment concluded that the mountainous terrain, dense jungles, and the technological limitations of the era rendered the project unfeasible. The immense effort required to dig through the isthmus using 17th-century engineering methods made construction virtually impossible, leading to its abandonment. In the 19th century, as European colonial powers expanded their influence in Southeast Asia, the concept of the Kra Canal resurfaced. The British, who controlled key maritime trade routes through Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, viewed any alternative shipping channel with suspicion. They feared that a canal through Thailand would weaken Singapore’s strategic importance and threaten British dominance in regional trade. Meanwhile, France, eager to strengthen its presence in Indochina, saw the canal as a way to establish a stronger foothold in the region and counterbalance British influence. However, the Siamese government, wary of foreign intervention and territorial disputes, strategically resisted both British and French involvement. By carefully balancing diplomatic relations with European powers while preserving its sovereignty, Siam managed to prevent any progress on the canal during this period. Kra Canal in the Contemporary Context The Kra Canal attracted renewed interest in 1972 when an American firm, Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS), proposed a 102-km-long canal connecting Satun to Songkhla. This proposal was driven by the need for an alternative shipping route to alleviate congestion in the Malacca Strait and provide a more direct maritime passage between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The plan involvedadvanced engineering techniques of the time, envisioning a deep-water canal capable of handling large cargo vessels and oil tankers. However, with a projected cost of $5.6 billion and a projected 10–12 year construction period, the Thai government ultimately rejected the plan. Concerns included the massive financial burden, environmental impact, and the risk of regional instability, particularly stemming from foreign influence and internal security challenges. More recently, China has become increasingly interested in reviving the project as part of its Maritime Silk Road initiative, a key component of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In 2015, an MoU was signed between private entities from China and Thailand to explore the feasibility of the canal, highlighting its potential to reshape trade routes and reduce reliance on the Malacca Strait. However, both governments quickly distanced themselves from the agreement, likely due to political sensitivities and opposition from regional players like Singapore and India. The canal never progressed beyond preliminary discussions. As of 2025, Thailand has instead opted to prioritize a $28 billion land bridge project—an overland transport corridor designed to facilitate cargo movement between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. This alternative aims to achieve similar economic benefits without the political and environmental challenges posed by a canal, making it a more viable and strategically balanced solution. Geopolitical Stakes Why the Kra Canal Matters If constructed, the Kra Canal would provide a strategic alternative to the Strait of Malacca, reducing shipping distances by approximately 1,200 nautical miles. This shortcut would save fuel costs, cut transit times, and ease congestion in the Strait of Malacca, which currently handles nearly 94,000 vessel passages annually. As global trade continues to expand, particularly in energy and container shipping, the demand for efficient and secure maritime routes is higher than ever. The canal would create an additional passage, reducing bottlenecks and alleviating concerns about over-reliance on a single trade route. China, as the world’s largest trading nation, would stand to benefit immensely by reducing its reliance on the Malacca Strait for energy imports and trade. Currently, approximately 80% of China’s oil imports pass through the Malacca Strait, making it a critical vulnerability in times of geopolitical tensions. Diversifying maritime routes through the Kra Canal could enhance China’s energy security, providing an alternative supply chain for crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from the Middle East and Africa. China-US Competition For China, the Kra Canal would address its 'Malacca dilemma'—the vulnerability of its maritime trade routes to potential blockades by rival naval forces, particularly the United States. A hypothetical China-controlled canal would enhance Beijing’s control over its supply chain and maritime security, while boosting its geopolitical influence in the region. Notably, the canal would enable China to establish a stronger presence in the Indian Ocean, allowing the PLA Navy greater operational flexibility and enhancing its ability to protect critical sea lanes. The United States and its allies, particularly Singapore and India, oppose the canal’s construction owing in large part to these geopolitical considerations. A China-dominated Kra Canal could reduce Singapore’s significance as a shipping hub, potentially diminishing its economic and strategic value. Singapore, which benefits heavily from transshipment fees and trade facilitation, would likely experience economic losses if traffic were diverted to a new canal. India, which has growing concerns over China’s increasing influence in the Indian Ocean, sees the Kra Canal as another strategic asset that could strengthen China’s maritime footprint near its sphere of influence. As a countermeasure, Washington is supporting Thailand’s land bridge project, which offers an alternative trade corridor without directly benefiting China’s strategic interests. The land bridge project, consisting of highways, rail networks, and deep-sea ports, provides a non-maritime alternative for trade while maintaining the regional balance of power. The United States has also increased maritime cooperation with Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines to ensure the continued security and open accessibility of the Malacca Strait. Regional Impacts For Thailand, the Kra Canal presents both opportunities and challenges. Economically, it could transform the country into a key logistics hub, generating substantial revenue from transit fees, port services, and related industries. By cutting travel distances for major shipping routes, the canal could increase direct investment in Thailand’s maritime infrastructure and create thousands of new jobs in shipping, trade, and logistics. The long-term economic benefits could help Thailand strengthen its position as a regional powerhouse in maritime commerce. However, from a stability standpoint, the canal threatens to divide Thailand geographically, reinforcing separatist movements in the south. The country has long struggled with separatist tensions in its southern provinces, and a canal physically splitting the nation could exacerbate these internal divisions. There are also concerns about foreign control or heavy foreign investment in the canal project, particularly if China were to play a dominant role in its financing and construction. Such involvement would inevitably spark concerns over sovereignty, with the canal potentially becoming an extension of China’s influence in the region. Additionally, the project would disrupt existing maritime economies, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, which have consistently opposed its development due to fears of economic losses. The canal’s success would depend on the extent to which it diverts shipping away from traditional routes. If global shipping companies find it more cost-effective and efficient to use the new passage, Singapore’s role as a regional shipping hub could decline, prompting diplomatic tensions and resistance from ASEAN partners. Given these economic and political complexities, Thailand must carefully weigh its options. Kra Canal: A Reality Check Despite its apparent advantages, the Kra Canal comes with a host of economic, environmental, and security concerns. The latest estimated construction cost has ballooned to $30 billion, making financial feasibility a major hurdle. Beyond the initial investment, maintenance costs and the need for continuous dredging due to sediment buildup would add to long-term expenditures. Additionally, securing international financing could be challenging, especially considering the canal’s geopolitical implications and potential opposition from regional powers. The environmental impact is another major concern. Constructing a canal of this scale would require large-scale excavation, leading to habitat destruction for marine and terrestrial wildlife. The potential for oil spills, increased shipping traffic, and disruptions to local fisheries could have lasting ecological consequences. Moreover, altering water flow between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand could impact ocean currents, salinity levels, and even regional weather patterns. Due to these challenges, the Thai government remains cautious, choosing instead to prioritize port expansions and alternative infrastructure projects. The modernization of Laem Chabang and Map Ta Phut ports aims to improve Thailand’s maritime logistics without the risks associated with the Kra Canal. Furthermore, the land bridge initiative offers a feasible alternative to facilitate cargo movement between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea while maintaining national unity and minimizing geopolitical tensions.

Gaza’s Future – OpEd	The Arab League held a summit in Cairo on March 4 with the sole intention of considering a comprehensive plan for Gaza’s future, master-minded by Egypt. Costed at some $53bn, it focuses in a 112-page document on emergency relief, rebuilding shattered infrastructure and long-term economic development. The conference endorsed the plan, as far as it went. The later stages will require more detailed consideration. It was on February 4 that US President Donald Trump announced his proposal to turn the Gaza Strip into a US-run 'Riviera of the Middle East', having first evacuated the population to any nearby Arab states willing to accept a total of some 2 million people. The Arab world, as well as much of the rest of the globe, greeted the idea with a mixture of astonishment and ridicule. Some commentators, claiming to know Trump’s methods, maintained that he had deliberately used shock tactics to goad the Arab world into playing a more active role in considering Gaza’s future and how to achieve it. If this was indeed the method in Trump’s madness, it produced results. A couple of weeks later, on February 17, news media worldwide reported that Egypt was preparing an alternative to Trump’s proposal in which evacuating the territory and relocating the Gazan population would play no part. In the event the Egyptian proposal called for establishing 'secure areas' within Gaza, where Palestinians can live temporarily while Egyptian and international construction firms reconstitute the Strip’s infrastructure. More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part, and the reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs for Gaza’s population. Winding up the summit on March 4 Egypt’s President Abdel el-Sisi welcomed 'the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian people to stay on their land without displacement.' In a social media post after the conference, Sisi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations and the international community 'to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian Issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region and establishes the Palestinian State.' The Egyptian plan outlines a three-phase process taking five years, starting with a six-month 'early recovery period' involving the establishment of 'safe zones'. Some 1.5 million displaced Gazans would be moved into 200,000 prefabricated housing units and 60,000 repaired homes. This stage is estimated to cost some $3bn The second phase, lasting two years and costing $20bn, would see housing and utilities rebuilt. During the third phase, which would take another two years, an airport, two seaports and an industrial zone would be built at a cost of $30bn. As for the Strip’s governance, a key aspect of this plan is the establishment of a temporary Governance Assistance Mission from which Hamas would be excluded. This interim body would oversee humanitarian aid and initiate reconstruction efforts until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) can assume control. Despite this exclusion, Hamas has publicly welcomed the Egyptian plan as signaling strong Arab alignment with the Palestinian cause. Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the summit’s final communique calls on the UN Security Council to deploy an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. In addition, the communique said Egypt will host an international conference in cooperation with the UN to agree on Gaza’s reconstruction. Funding will probably require investment from oil-rich Gulf governments including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. A trust fund, overseen by the World Bank, will be established to handle pledges and donor-provided funds. A final stage, still open for Arab discussion and refinement, would start the process of creating a sovereign Palestinian state. Establishing inter-connectivity between the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip would be an early priority. In tackling this conundrum the planners need look no further than Trump’s own comprehensive plan, 'Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People', issued on 28 January 2020. The result of years of intensive diplomatic effort by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the plan envisaged the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank, excluding the settlements, plus a Gaza greatly expanded by a swath of Israeli territory south of the Strip. All Palestinian occupied territories would be made contiguous by way of a network of highways and a road tunnel linking the West Bank to Gaza. The published plan contained maps illustrating how all enclaves of a sovereign Palestine could be inter-connected. Trump’s plan was no sooner unveiled than it was vehemently rejected by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority (PA), and other voices in the Arab world. But not universally. Significantly, both Saudi Arabia and Egypt seemed prepared to give the plan a fair hearing. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: 'Egypt recognizes the importance of considering the US administration's initiative from the perspective of the importance of achieving the resolution of the Palestinian issue, thus restoring to the Palestinian people their full legitimate rights…' Egypt’s new plan for Gaza’s future, while carrying the whole-hearted approval of the Arab League, has not fared so well in US and Israeli circles. The AP news agency reported that White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes has dismissed the Egyptian proposal as unworkable. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable,' said Hughes on March 4, 'and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance. President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' A spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry, Oren Marmorstein, posted on X that the Egyptian plan 'fails to address the realities of the situation'. The plan, he said, remains 'rooted in outdated perspectives.' Nevertheless Egypt’s plan garnered backing from the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who attended the Arab summit. 'I welcome and strongly endorse the Arab-led initiative to mobilize support for Gaza’s reconstruction,' he said. 'The UN stands ready to fully cooperate in this endeavor.' Initial knee-jerk reactions by US and Israeli spokesmen to the Arab-endorsed plan may yet be modified, especially as the White Housse announced on March 5 that the US was engaged in direct talks with Hamas. The door Is open for discussion and negotiation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6ukLVxs5HAIk-	2025-03-14T17:05:15-07:00	
Iran: The IRGC’s Fuel Smuggling Mafia – OpEd	Amid the power struggle and the impeachment battle of Abdolnaser Hemmati, the Iranian regime’s minister of economy, the issue of large-scale fuel smuggling has resurfaced. On February 26, Iranian regime president Masoud Pezeshkian said, 'Who is responsible for taking this massive amount of reserves out of the country? It is not possible for someone to smuggle diesel by hand or in small barrels across the border. Such large-scale smuggling requires an extensive network, so it must be clarified who is involved in this cycle' (Jamaran website, February 26, 2025). Even if it is unclear to others who is involved in this cycle, Pezeshkian knows well. He understands that the fuel smuggling corruption is linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the military arm of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, for whose longevity Pezeshkian prays daily. On March 1, the state-affiliated Ham-Mihan newspaper highlighted Pezeshkian’s admission: 'Smugglers buy diesel at 3,000 rials per liter and sell it for 700,000 rials per liter.' It then questioned: 'Why don’t you name the smugglers? Is it against the policy of unity? Who are these smugglers? … When you publish an official report listing the names of these ‘respectable’ smugglers, the people will believe that you can actually stop it.' Pezeshkian knows well that 30 million liters of fuel cannot be smuggled daily using small containers. Fuel smuggling is different from garment smuggling—it is controlled by entities with the tools to regulate, monitor, and even legitimize such operations. The IRGC, leveraging its influence over ports, land borders, and international networks, has turned fuel smuggling into a highly profitable industry. Pezeshkian is not distant from this cycle either. He is not here to expose the IRGC’s secrets; rather, he aims to use the disappearance of oil barrels as a political weapon to pressure his economy minister. Pezeshkian, in turn, seeks to use this issue to force his rivals into retreat in the power struggle. That is why, once the uproar over the 'impeachment' and 'resignation' subsided, Pezeshkian also stopped talking about corruption and fuel smuggling. However, the trail of smuggled 20, 30, or even 50 million barrels of oil is such a massive scandal that its signs occasionally emerge in the regime’s internal power and wealth struggles, as voiced by its own figures and media. The Tabnak website, affiliated with former IRGC commander Mohsen Rezaei, reported on December 28, quoting Alireza Salimi, a member of the parliament’s presidium: 'The oil minister told our commission that we are buying nearly 9 million liters of fuel from smugglers. So you know who the smugglers are because you’re buying from them! The trail is in your hands. Losing 20 million liters is a big deal—it’s no joke.' Some regime-affiliated experts claim that the actual amount of fuel smuggling is far greater than 20 or 30 million liters per day. The state-run Arman-e Emrooz newspaper, on December 23, quoted an economic expert: 'We consume 120 million liters of gasoline per day. Of this, only 70 million liters are actual domestic consumption—the rest is smuggled out of the country… Hossein Raghfar stated that this cannot be carried out solely by border porters or ordinary individuals; rather, it is an organized operation—in other words, a government-run enterprise.' By 'government-run,' he refers to the regime’s own machinery of looting, crime, and oppression. The same apparatus that, under the banner of the IRGC, burned dozens of impoverished Baluchi fuel carriers alive in their vehicles in March 2021. At that time, the IRGC attempted to block fuel carriers by digging deep ditches and setting up roadblocks. At the Askan border point, they opened fire with tank-mounted machine guns on the fuel carriers and the people who came to support them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6ury-EUX16IZ5	2025-03-14T17:03:32-07:00	
Closing Signs Are Signs Of The Times – OpEd	By Mark Thornton It was not long ago when signs for 'Help Wanted' seemed to be in every store window. That is starting to be replaced in 2024 and 2025 with 'Store Closing' signs. This switcheroo tells us volumes about how people and the economy are adjusting to the Fed’s money printing business. While the government and the wealthy elite benefit from the money printing, consumers and workers only seem to suffer. I do feel sorry for the rank-and-file workers in the economy, but my greatest gratitude and admiration is for the entrepreneurs and managers that are responsible for our prosperity, provide all the real jobs, and, in addition, create the tax base. Their much-maligned work and the changes they have been forced to make are truly remarkable in the face of the onslaught of change that has been unleashed by the government and the Federal Reserve, especially since covid. According to the ABCT, firings, mass layoffs and closures are late-stage events that are predictable from the previous stages starting with the Fed’s money printing. It is not the result of some random or mysterious psychological process. Sure, managers make plenty of what appear to be bonehead decisions, but I don’t envy them for the tough decisions they have to make every day. We know it’s a Fed-caused business cycle because the trends happen in stages along with spikes in the data, rather than in a normal fashion, with no spikes and correlation—so large numbers of 'Help Wanted' signs followed later by large numbers of 'Store Closure' signs. The time of adjustment with business cycles is uncertain. We don’t know exactly how much time will be involved or exactly how events will unfold. We do know that Trump’s tariffs will make things worse, but not by how much. The ways in which people have been adapting is particularly illuminating to the cause of the cycle—the Fed’s money supply expansion, but also to the fact that it causes, not just higher prices, but that it does cause a cyclical disturbance and that it creates winners and losers, and that, above all else, paper money is not neutral! Last year, retail closures reached 3/4 of the covid peak (boosted by some corporate bankruptcies) including large numbers of Family Dollar stores, CVS pharmacies, and Big Lots. That number is expected to double in 2025, led by Party City, Walgreens, 7-Eleven, and Macy’s. According to Intelligent HQ, in 2024 the: Goldman Sachs survey found that 91% of small business owners are struggling with the current economic impact on their industries. 56% report that the situation has worsened since the beginning of the year. Are small business owners prepared for these upcoming challenges in 2025? Of course, many small independent businesses are also closing, partly for traditional reasons because small independent businesses fail a lot even in normal times, but also for cycle-related reasons, such as a downturn in the real income of their consumers and the abnormally and stubbornly rising costs due to monetary inflation by the Fed. Changing consumer trends have been happening forever and the online trend has been firmly in place for 25 years and the delivery trend for over 5 years. These are also chains that are both opening and closing stores in large numbers. The retail landscape has already been adapting to those changing trends. One trend that we have been pointing to is the economic pinch inflation has on low and middle-income families. See the recent episode on how inflation is impacting 'satisfaction' and voting patterns. There are also signs that consumers are trading down from Target, to Walmart, and to the dollar stores, in addition to just 'doing without.' The other dominant trend is the stubbornness of rising costs. Labor has become more expensive and scarce in many occupations. The costs of materials and goods continue to rise. Rent, utilities, insurance continue to rise. The cost of government red tape and access to capital are major problems. This is frustrating to consumers and business owners alike. Business closures and startups are visible, but entrepreneurs and managers have been working at a frantic pace to keep companies operational and profitable enough to stay in business and expand. Staffing and shift changes, input mixes, technological fixes, product lines, and operating hours are just some of the noteworthy aspects or 'margins' of the business that have been changing at revolutionary speed compared to normal conditions. Of course, customers don’t like price hikes, surcharges, and automated tipping, but—under the circumstances—it is completely understandable. There are also business-specific changes that have been made. A restaurant may have transitioned from dine-in only to take-out only, to dine-in and take out, added delivery, and become a catering-only business in a matter of a few years. The menu had to change, hours of operation, along with big staffing changes. Inventories and suppliers of food items, condiments, and cleaning supplies all changed. Washing dishes and glasses might now all be replaced with take-out containers. The industrial dishwasher might be just sitting there, taking up space, or replaced with some cooking unit and the dishwasher crew replaced with a delivery crew or social media contractor. Even the politicized choice of what type of straw to offer customers has become a tense business decision! As Hayek pointed out, the knowledge to make such changes only exists in the mind of individuals at the local level. Their incentive to profit and stay in business is the reason for the dependability of capitalism. You should read Ludwig von Mises’s article 'Profit and Loss.' Artificial intelligence might help with this small business decision-making and that of their franchise-chain big brothers, but it will never be able to replace it. Of course, Hayek’s point also lays bare the general ineptitude of government-run operations to even keep up under such dynamic or even normal conditions! Government bureaucracies can only continue to exist with subsidized, routinized operations. The main source of our frustrations as consumers is the Federal Reserve. I will continue to be grateful to the entrepreneurs and managers and their staff for trudging through these difficult times.

Trump Sees ‘Very Good Chance’ Of Peace After ‘Productive’ Talks W...	(RFE/RL) -- US President Donald Trump said he sees a 'very good chance' for peace between Ukraine and Russia after 'very good and productive discussions' between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a March 14 post on his Truth Social site, Trump also said the United States had urged Russia to spare the lives of 'thousands' of Ukrainian soldiers that Putin has said have been isolated by Russian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine disputes that claim. The post came just hours after the Kremlin said it was 'cautiously optimistic' following a meeting late on March 13 between Putin and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. 'We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,' Trump wrote. Trump added that 'thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position.' 'I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared,' he wrote. 'This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.' Putin said a day earlier that a group of Ukrainian troops were 'isolated' in the Kursk region, the site of a surprise incursion by Ukrainian forces last August. Responding to Trump's plea on March 14, he said the soldiers' lives would be spared if they surrendered and urged Kyiv to order them to do so. Officials in Kyiv have said that while Ukrainian forces have been slowly withdrawing in the Kursk region under heavy pressure from Russian troops, but the armed forces general staff said on March 14 that '[r]eports of the alleged 'encirclement' of Ukrainian units...in the Kursk region are false and fabricated.' 'There is no threat of encirclement of our units,' it said in a statement on social media. Zelenskyy Challenges Putin's Motives Earlier on March 14, Putin's spokesman said there were grounds for 'cautious optimism' over Trump's 30-day cease-fire proposal, which Ukraine accepted earlier this week at talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine, meanwhile, questioned Moscow's sincerity in ending the war, which is now in its fourth year since Russia's full-scale invasion on February 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Putin sent Trump a message about his cease-fire proposal after his talks with Witkoff in the Russian capital. 'When Mr Witkoff brings all the information to President Trump, we will determine the timing of a conversation (between Trump and Putin). There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic,' Peskov said. Putin said a day earlier that he agrees in principle with the US proposal for a temporary cease-fire with Ukraine, but added that 'there are nuances,' such as Western weapons deliveries to Kyiv, that he wants addressed first. The Russian leader also said any agreement should lead to long-term peace that addresses the 'root' reasons for the war, an apparent reference to NATO expansion and other developments Putin claims have put Russia's security in jeopardy. In a video posted late on March 13, Zelenskyy questioned Putin's motives, saying the Russian leader was preparing to reject the proposal but was afraid to tell Trump.'That's why in Moscow they are imposing upon the idea of a cease-fire these conditions -- so that nothing happens at all, or so that it cannot happen for as long as possible,' Zelenskyy said. He followed up on March 14 with a post on social media accusing the Kremlin of trying to 'complicate and drag out the process.' 'Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down,' he said on X after a call with the Secretary of State of the Holy See, cardinal Pietro Parolin. Putin's Response To Trump's Pressure Kyiv agreed to Trump's 30-day cease-fire proposal at a meeting in Jeddah on March 11, putting the onus for peace in Moscow's lap. Putin's response threw the ball back into US hands, at least to some degree. Trump called Putin's initial reaction to peace talk developments 'promising' but incomplete, though he added he hoped Russia would 'do the right thing' and agree to the deal. 'I think the Russians are keen not to be seen as the intransigent party as that could lead to consequences from Trump, such as sanctions. So that informed Putin's comments today,' John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank, told RFE/RL. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a top priority since taking office for a second term less than two months ago, and is wielding US leverage to get both Kyiv and Moscow to the table. On March 13, the US administration heightened pressure on Russia by increasing restrictions on the country's oil, gas, and banking sectors. Among the measures, the Treasury Department was allowing the expiration of a 60-day exemption put in place in January by the Biden administration that let some energy transactions involving sanctioned Russian banks continue. The move would make it more difficult for other nations, especially in Europe, to buy Russian oil. Meanwhile, the foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) -- which includes the United States, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan -- said they discussed imposing more sanctions on Russia and boosting support for Ukraine if the Kremlin does not agree to the cease-fire. Among the measures discussed during the March 13-14 meeting were caps on the price for Russian oil exports, they said in a joint statement. Western nations in late 2022 imposed a $60-a-barrel price cap on the export of Russian oil using Western ships or insurance. It is unclear if the G7 discussions touched on lowering the price cap. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, which account for a third of federal budget revenues. In a joint statement following the meeting, the G7 said that 'we reaffirmed our unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty, and independence.' 'We welcomed ongoing efforts to achieve a ceasefire, and in particular the meeting on March 11 between the US and Ukraine in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,' it added. Putin also said there were several unanswered questions in the proposal, such as what to do about Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. 'If we have a cease-fire, does that mean that everyone there would leave?' Putin said. 'Should we release them [Ukrainian troops] after they committed crimes against the population? Or would they surrender?' Ukraine denies committing such crimes, saying it abides by humanitarian law and does not target civilians. Why Should Russia Agree To A Cease-Fire? Kyiv seized a swath of the Kursk region in a stealth incursion in August, a move seen as an effort to divert Russian forces from eastern Ukraine and use the territory as a bargaining chip in any peace talks. That strategy is now failing as Russian forces supported by North Korean troops push the Ukrainians out of Kursk. Russia has regained more than half the territory in Kursk initially captured by Ukraine. Zelenskyy told reporters on March 14 that the situation in Kursk was 'obviously very difficult.' Among the other concerns Putin voiced about the cease-fire proposal is whether Ukraine would use the 30-day period to mobilize and train forces or rearm with the help of the West. He also raised the question of how the nearly 2,000-kilometer front would be monitored. Zelenskyy told reporters that the front could be monitored by US satellites. Experts had warned that Putin would likely seek to drag out cease-fire talks because his forces have the upper hand on the battlefield. Aside from the advances in Kursk, Russia is gaining territory in eastern Ukraine -- albeit at high human and material costs -- due to its significant manpower advantage. However, Zelenskyy said Ukraine has stopped Russian forces at the gates of Pokrovsk, a key logistical hub in Donetsk region, after months of fighting on the outskirts of the city. Zelenskyy asserted that the incursion into Kursk forced Russia to pull forces from eastern Ukraine, giving his troops time to defend the city. Russia is seeking to capture at a minimum the entirety of the four regions of Ukraine it claims to have annexed in September 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson. A cease-fire freezing the current front lines would leave them short of that goal. 'One way the Russians could slow down this process without coming out directly and saying 'no', is by dragging out those technical discussions on monitoring' the cease-fire, Hardie said. 'That could also give them ways to try to pin the blame back on Ukraine, by insisting on certain technical matters that Ukraine might find objectionable,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uk4N6JyS2bBV	2025-03-14T16:59:42-07:00	
NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 Launches To International Space Station	Four crew members of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission launched at 7:03 p.m. EDT Friday from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a science expedition aboard the International Space Station. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelled the Dragon spacecraft into orbit carrying NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov. The spacecraft will dock autonomously to the forward-facing port of the station’s Harmony module at approximately 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 15. Shortly after docking, the crew will join Expedition 72/73 for a long-duration stay aboard the orbiting laboratory. 'Congratulations to our NASA and SpaceX teams on the 10th crew rotation mission under our commercial crew partnership. This milestone demonstrates NASA’s continued commitment to advancing American leadership in space and driving growth in our national space economy,' said NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro.'Through these missions, we are laying the foundation for future exploration, from low Earth orbit to the Moon and Mars. Our international crew will contribute to innovative science research and technology development, delivering benefits to all humanity.' During Dragon’s flight, SpaceX will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Hawthorne, California. NASA will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. NASA’s live coverage resumes at 9:45 p.m., March 15, on NASA+ with rendezvous, docking, and hatching opening. After docking, the crew will change out of their spacesuits and prepare cargo for offload before opening the hatch between Dragon and the space station’s Harmony module around 1:05 a.m., Sunday, March 16. Once the new crew is aboard the orbital outpost, NASA will broadcast welcome remarks from Crew-10 and farewell remarks from the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 crew, beginning at about 1:40 a.m. The number of crew aboard the space station will increase to 11 for a short time as Crew-10 joins NASA astronauts Nick Hague, Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Don Pettit, as well as Roscosmos cosmonauts Aleksandr Gorbunov, Alexey Ovchinin, and Ivan Vagner. Following a brief handover period, Hague, Williams, Wilmore, and Gorbunov will return to Earth no earlier than Wednesday, March 19.Ahead of Crew-9’s departure from station, mission teams will review weather conditions at the splashdown sites off the coast of Florida. With this mission, NASA continues to maximize the use of the orbiting laboratory, where people have lived and worked continuously for more than 24 years, testing technologies, performing science, and developing the skills needed to operate future commercial destinations in low Earth orbit and explore farther from our home planet. Research conducted at the space station benefits people on Earth and paves the way for future long-duration missions to the Moon under NASA’s Artemis campaign and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uhFkACzhMr4z	2025-03-14T16:58:22-07:00	
How Merz Hopes To End The Indecisive ‘German Vote’ In Brussels	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- Europe's fate partly lies in the hands of sixteen Germans. That's how many negotiators will design the future European policy of the continent’s largest and most populous economy, as the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) thrash out a coalition agreement in talks that started yesterday. The section on European affairs in the agreement has not usually been a major priority. But this time around, the negotiators got a special assignment from the very top. After three years of German indecision in Brussels, Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democrat chancellor-in-waiting, wants the country to take on a major leadership role in deciding the response to the myriad of challenges facing the continent. His solution? An institutional redesign that would assign more power over European policymaking to himself. It would help avoid the chronic deadlock between successive multi-party governments that's left Berlin silent on key EU issues in recent years. But it's also likely to ruffle feathers in coalition talks that are only just getting underway. Merz stresses that the alternative would be dire, however: 'If Germany remains silent, (...) we are also damaging the ability of the entire European community to act,' he said in a programmatic speech on his future foreign policy in January. Chronic indecision in Berlin The SPD likely shares Merz's diagnosis, as few were happy about the impression that Germany's SPD-led three-party coalition left in Brussels over the last three years. With European decision-making divvied up between different parties and ministries, indecision on key issues has been a problem at least since the days of Angela Merkel's 'Grand Coalitions'. Where the French president has almost full authority over his country's European course, the chancellor must find a common position within his government. When German coalition partners fail to agree on a joint position, then Berlin must abstain from voting on EU legislation – an outcome that's become so common it's dubbed the 'German vote'. In Berlin, a multi-departmental legislative file like EU migration reform has to be greenlighted by all ministries involved, requiring – in the case of migration – the approval of the foreign and interior ministers. Even the responsibility for coordination is split. The Chancellery's EU department can step in to adjudicate political conflicts between the parties; but the Foreign Office and the Economy Ministry are formally in charge of coordination between ministries, government sources explained. They also split responsibility for prepping European Council summits with the Chancellery, while a junior minister at the Foreign Office controls the EU reform and enlargement portfolios. That gives the Foreign Office – typically held by a junior coalition partner – a good deal of influence over EU matters. In short, it is a patchwork of overlapping responsibilities that has often left little space for Berlin to put forward a cohesive European vision. Things deteriorated under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party government, which featured near-constant conflict between Scholz's Social Democrats, the Greens and the free-market liberal Free Democrats (FDP). 'In this past legislative period, almost all ministers [lacked] a sense for Europe,' acknowledged one SPD source, also pointing to Scholz's detachment from the issue, as he is mainly 'a transatlanticist'. The coalition partners repeatedly failed to engage with key EU legislation until the last minute, only to ultimately abstain from taking any position at all over a lack of agreement in Berlin. The most notorious example was the EU's proposed ban on the sale of new petrol cars, which had been fully negotiated in Brussels – only to be blocked when Germany pulled out just before the final vote due to an internal veto by the FDP. That Germany, home to a mighty car industry, hadn't weighed in earlier left many elsewhere in the EU baffled and irritated. Is a mightier Merz the answer? Merz has vowed to end all of the above. He is not planning on taking chances by relying on verbal commitments alone, as the previous coalition agreement did. Merz is aiming for an institutional redesign, as he outlined in January. The first pillar will be to create a powerful new national security council that he hopes to turn into 'the centre of gravity for the government's collective decision-making on all the main issues of foreign, security, development, and European policy'. The second pillar is to unite the steering power over European policy directly under the chancellor. The catch? Getting his perspective coalition partners to go along with that power grab won’t be easy. Creating a security council is likely the least controversial part, as the SPD had previously attempted to create such an institution under Scholz, only to be blocked by the Greens. But with an SPD politician almost certain to lay claim to the Foreign Office, it's unlikely they'd agree to shipping those European competences over to the Chancellery without a fight. 'I think we would protest strongly,' said the SPD source. 'We would not be smart if we left European policy entirely to the Christian Democrats, because European policy is also extremely important for the crucial areas of the economy and energy.' Experts still believe that Merz has a chance to improve European policy coordination, as the SPD's new leaders also have an interest in strengthening Germany's leadership in Europe, according to an analysis of the wider European impact of the German election by the Jacques Delors Centre's Johannes Lindner, Thu Nguyen, and Jannik Jansen. 'However, complete centralisation in the Chancellery will not be possible – if only because of [ministerial independence] and the need for coordination between the CDU/CSU and SPD,' Lindner told Euractiv. A lot will hinge on ministers' ability to improve timely coordination, he argued. 'The coalition negotiations now are a first test of how close they are to each other on the most important European policy issues.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uoPqLIm06F-w	2025-03-14T16:53:45-07:00	
All Eyes On Putin For Next Step To Ukraine Peace – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Global events can move quickly. Just two weeks ago, the world watched as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a heated exchange with US President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office. A planned rare earths mineral deal was scrapped at the last minute, and Zelensky was sent out of the White House in an unprecedented diplomatic standoff. But hard work and sincere diplomacy can pay off. Behind the scenes, both sides worked tirelessly to repair the relationship, culminating in a high-stakes meeting in Jeddah this week that brought the US-Ukraine relationship back on track and set the stage for what could be the first meaningful step toward ending Russia’s three-year invasion of Ukraine. Trump has been clear about his desire to end the war, but since returning to office in January he has learned that this is easier said than done. The meeting in Jeddah was the first concrete step in that process. One of Trump’s biggest criticisms of Ukraine during the heated White House exchange was that he did not believe Zelensky was sincere about wanting peace. After Jeddah, that perception has changed. The US and Ukraine agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire on land, at sea, and in the air — a deal that could be extended if all parties agree. However, Kyiv would not implement it unless Moscow agreed to do the same. Forty-eight hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a ceasefire but added conditions that make its implementation uncertain. The US and Ukraine also finalized the draft of the minerals deal that had been abandoned at the White House. Trump has even invited Zelensky back to the Oval Office, signaling a major turnaround in their strained relationship. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: 'The ball is in Russia’s court.' Last week I made my fourth visit to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Anyone who has spent time there knows that Ukrainians want an end to the war. They endure nightly air raids, missile strikes, and drone attacks. They also understand the long-term threat that Russia poses if there are no real security guarantees. For those of us who have seen wartime Ukraine firsthand, it has always been obvious that the Ukrainian people want the fighting to end. Yet some around Trump question whether Zelensky shares this view. After Jeddah, there is no longer any doubt. It is now up to Russia to decide whether to pursue peace. There is still a long way to go, and plenty of opportunities for setbacks. Even if a temporary ceasefire were agreed on, the war would be far from over. The night before the Jeddah talks, Ukraine launched its largest drone strike yet, sending nearly 400 to hit targets as far away as Moscow. Meanwhile Russia has continued its relentless bombardment of Ukraine with missiles and drones on a near-nightly basis. When I visited the front lines in the Kherson region, it was clear that decisions made in Jeddah, Washington, or Moscow are often irrelevant to those fighting on the ground. For the soldiers in the trenches, survival is the only priority. Until an actual ceasefire is implemented — not just discussed — nothing will change for them. Another major development in the war, and one that represents a significant setback for Ukraine, is Russia’s counteroffensive in its Kursk region. Ukraine launched a surprise attack last August and captured a sizeable portion of territory. The idea was to hold on to this land as a bargaining chip for future negotiations. But over the past seven months, Russian forces — bolstered by thousands of North Korean troops — have steadily regained control. Last week it appears that Moscow had completed its recapture of all the territory Ukraine seized. It will be up to future historians to assess whether the Kursk offensive accomplished tactical objectives or if it was a strategic miscalculation. In the short term, however, it does not help Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table. The loss of Kursk weakens its leverage. After traveling around Ukraine this past week, I am certain of one thing: the Ukrainian people are exhausted from the war. But they also know they have no choice but to keep fighting as long as Russia continues its aggression. If there is to be any lasting peace, it must include security guarantees ensuring that Russia will not attack again. This is the biggest challenge for Kyiv. Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and has shifted the responsibility for security guarantees on to Europe. However, because the U.S. and most European countries operate under the same security umbrella, in practice it would be difficult to separate American and European commitments. The road to peace is long, and the war is far from over. The ongoing fighting in Donetsk, Kursk, and Kherson proves that reality. The biggest question now is whether the progress made in Jeddah will hold. There is always the risk that Trump is looking for a short-term political victory rather than a lasting peace agreement. If the ceasefire collapses, the war will probably escalate again, and Ukraine may find itself in an even more difficult position than before. For now, all eyes are on Moscow. The coming weeks will determine whether Russia is serious about peace or if the war will continue indefinitely. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

California Endangers Self-Defense – OpEd	Last August in downtown San Francisco, an armed gunman stalked San Francisco 49ers rookie receiver Ricky Pearsall and demanded his watch along with everything he carried. Pearsall refused to comply and in the ensuing struggle took a bullet in the chest. The attack brought no public comment from Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, and state Attorney General Rob Bonta. Also holding off was Assemblyman Rick Zbur, Los Angeles Democrat and Harvard law alum. Zbur’s new bill makes a case that Pearsall should have handed over his valuables, run away, or both. According to Zbur’s Assembly Bill 1333, the use of deadly force by an innocent party—'homicide' in the bill’s text—is not justified: When the person was outside of their residence and knew that using force likely to cause death or great bodily injury could have been avoided with complete safety by retreating. When the person used more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against a danger. When the person was the assailant, engaged in mutual combat, or knowingly engaged in conduct reasonably likely to provoke a person to commit a felony or do some great bodily injury, except if either of the following circumstances apply: The person reasonably believed that they were in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, and had exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily injury. In good faith, the person withdrew from the encounter with the other assailant or assailants and indicated clearly to the other assailant or assailants that the person desired to withdraw and terminated the use of any force, but the other assailant or assailants continued or resumed the use of force. According to Zbur, his bill 'was never intended to limit a crime victim’s right to defend yourself, your family, or home.' In an X post now unavailable, Zbur claimed, 'the goal is to prevent wannabe vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse from provoking violence & claiming self defense after the fact.' The assemblyman failed to note that Rittenhouse, 18, deployed deadly force while under attack and was acquitted of all charges. Zbur did not cite the looters who gunned down retired St. Louis policeman David Dorn or any of the many homicides during the 2020 riots in cities across the nation. A politician concerned about public safety might also have cited James Hodgkinson, who in 2017 deployed an SKS rifle against members of Congress as they played baseball. The attack nearly killed Rep. Steve Scalise, who had no time to run away. Consider also wannabe assassin Thomas Mathew Crooks. On July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania, the 20-year-old Crooks eluded the Secret Service detail and got off eight shots, wounding presidential candidate Donald Trump, killing rally attendee Corey Comperatore, and wounding James Copenhaver and David Dutch. None of the attendees had time to flee. Californians can be forgiven for believing that AB-1333 benefits violent criminals while menacing the people’s right to self-defense. They might examine The Right to Bear Arms: A Constitutional Right of the People or a Privilege of the Ruling Class? by Stephen P. Halbrook, author of That Every Man Be Armed: Evolution of a Constitutional Right. And while debating AB-1333, know that a more dangerous bill is already state law. In September 2018, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 1391, which bars all prosecution of criminals under 16 in adult court. That means anyone under the age of 16 could murder Ricky Pearsall, be tried only in juvenile court, and gain release at age 25. The 49er miraculously survived and played well in his first season. His attacker has been charged with attempted murder, assault with a semiautomatic weapon, and attempted second-degree robbery. At this writing, the 17-year-old has yet to be publicly identified.

ComInfFest 2025: MTUCI Discusses Prospects For Exporting Russian ...	An initiative, designed to foster a strategic collaboration between educational institutions from Russia and Africa, is set to bring together exceptional young professionals in the field of information technology. On 13th March 2025, the Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) hosted a large-scale roundtable discussion on 'Exporting Russian IT Education' as part of the International Science Festival 'Festival of Communications and Informatics Science - ComInfFest 2025'. The event became an important platform for discussing issues of promoting Russian educational programs in the field of information technology in the international arena. The roundtable was attended by representatives of embassies of 15 foreign countries and diasporas, interested government bodies of the Russian Federation, leading IT companies, international student organizations, as well as the president of the Cameroonian diaspora in the Russian Federation and chairman of the commission for work with African diasporas of the Russian-African Club of Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Louis Gouend. MTUCI Rector Sergey Erokhin, the roundtable moderator, emphasized the growing interest in Russian IT education students from different countries, noting the need to create favorable conditions for their successful studies, adaptation, and professional development. Deputy Head of Rossotrudnichestvo Pavel Shevtsov emphasized the importance of creating attractive conditions for professional growth and employment of foreign students. Louis Gouend emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between the Russian and African educational communities and the role of the Russian IT sector in developing the potential of African students. He also touched upon the issues of adaptation of international students, proposing innovative integration methods and stressed that Africa will be a huge growing market for Russian IT education by 2050. The participants discussed issues of social and cultural adaptation, competitiveness of Russian education, and ways to overcome language barriers. The experts further emphasized the need for active interaction with foreign partners, popularization of Russian IT education, as well as interaction between educational institutions and businesses to create practical-oriented programs. At the end of the large-scale roundtable, Louis Gouend discussed with the university management the possibility of receiving subsidies for African students studying in the preparatory course. Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) is a Russian university which specializes in the field of information technology, telecommunications, and information security. It currently has an enrollment of approximately 15,000 students. In January 1992, in accordance with Order of the Government of Russia, it received the status of as a technical university and transformed into the Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uq9tKE1kHGaX	2025-03-14T16:46:06-07:00	
Iraq Says Key Islamic State Leader Is Dead	By Jeff Seldin One of the Islamic State terror group's most senior leaders is reportedly dead, killed in what Iraq is describing as a U.S.-supported operation. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani posted on social media Friday that the country's intelligence service 'successfully eliminated' IS deputy caliph Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufay'i. Sudani did not say when or how al-Rufay'i was killed, calling the death a 'significant security achievement.' Iraqi special forces, in a subsequent post on the X social media platform, said al-Rufay’i was killed Thursday in an airstrike targeting his location in Iraq’s Anbar desert. Officials said the strike was the result of a two-year effort to track his location, with breakthroughs coming in the past six months. The officials also said they arrested seven additional IS members, including two women, in a follow-up operation in Anbar. Intelligence collected at the scene of the airstrike further led to the arrest of another five people in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil. Iraqi officials said that al-Rufay'i, also known as Abu Khadija, was the top IS official for Iraq and Syria, and that he also played a key role in the group's external operations. A recent United Nations report, based on intelligence from U.N. member states, said al-Rufay'i ran IS operations across Iraq, Syria, Turkey and other parts of the Middle East. Other U.N. intelligence reports have identified al-Rufay'i as a member of IS' delegated committee, viewed as the terror group's most influential executive body. U.S. officials have yet to comment on the Iraqi claims. Various intelligence estimates put the number of IS fighters across Iraq and Syria at between 1,500 and 3,000, with the majority operating out of Syria. U.S. military officials warned in July of a possible IS resurgence in the region, saying the terror group was on a pace to more than double the number of attacks it had carried out in Iraq and Syria the previous year. More recently, in December, U.S. forces carried out a series of airstrikes against IS in Syria, hitting targets in areas abandoned by counterterror forces loyal to former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Despite those operations, intelligence shared by the U.N. indicated IS has been trying to take advantage of the fall of the Assad regime and resulting political turmoil. The U.N. report also said IS 'maintained the ability to operate and replace field commanders.' Yet while Iraq and Syria are central to IS' founding ideology, there has been a growing consensus among intelligence officials and experts that the terror group no longer sees the Middle East as its base for global operations. Officials, including those from the U.S., have said there is growing confidence that the group is now being led by Abdul Qadir Mumin, who has been based in Somalia, where he rose to prominence as the emir of the group's Somali affiliate, IS-Somalia. An offensive launched by forces in Somalia's Puntland region earlier this month, in part to chase after Mumin, has met with surprising success, pushing IS-Somalia out of some of its key strongholds. But the campaign has yet to find any traces of Mumin or other top IS leaders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6unM1X-0KuOaN	2025-03-14T16:44:34-07:00	
US Sanctions Thai Officials For Deporting Uyghurs To China	By Alex Willemyns U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday announced visa sanctions against Thai government officials involved in last month’s deportation of 40 Uyghurs to China, where they likely face torture as part of what American officials call an ongoing 'genocide.' The men had been held in immigration detention in Thailand since escaping China’s persecution in 2014. The Thai government’s decision to return them to China on Feb. 27 was criticized by the United States, European Union, United Nations and global human rights groups. Rubio said the U.S. visa bans will apply to Thai officials 'responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return of Uyghurs' to China, where he said 'they are subject to torture and enforced disappearances.' 'In light of China’s longstanding acts of genocide and crimes against humanity committed against Uyghurs, we call on governments around the world not to forcibly return Uyghurs and other groups to China,' Rubio said in a statement issued by the U.S. State Department. The statement also said some family members of the officials may be banned from traveling to the United States under the blacklisting. The State Department did not respond to an inquiry from Radio Free Asia about how many officials would be subjected to the ban. Officials at the department routinely decline to identify the names of those hit with visa bans, citing U.S. immigration laws around privacy. The United States has since 2021 described China’s persecution of the mostly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs as a 'genocide,' leveling accusations of torture, forced sterilization and slavery against Chinese officials. Beijing rejects the claims and says it only promotes development and vocational training in far-western Xinjiang, where most Uyghurs live. Close alliance The deportation of the Uyghurs and the visa sanctions is a rare case of acrimony between longtime allies in the United States and Thailand. In the days after the Feb. 27 deportation, a State Department official confirmed to RFA that U.S. diplomats offered to resettle the Uyghurs either in the United States or a third country, while a Thai opposition lawmaker said Australia and Sweden also made similar offers. Thai Vice Foreign Minister Russ Jalichandra eventually acknowledged that such offers had been made but said that Bangkok had finally agreed to return the Uyghurs to China to avoid inevitable 'retaliation from China that would impact the livelihoods of many Thais.' Rubio had said during his Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 15 that he believed he could use America’s close historical relationship with Thailand to ensure the Uyghurs were not returned to Thailand. 'The good news is that Thailand is actually a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally as well, and so that is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results, because of how important that relationship is and how close it is,' Rubio said at that time. World Uyghur Congress executive committee chair Rushan Abbas welcomed Friday’s visa bans, saying the move sent a clear warning to other governments that 'they will face consequences' for working with China to return escaped Uyghurs. 'This announcement is a critical step in holding those complicit in these egregious forced deportations accountable,' Abbas told RFA. 'For Uyghurs, forced return to China is tantamount to a death sentence, exposing them to torture, forced labor and enforced disappearances,' she said. 'This policy delivers a strong message that aiding China’s crimes will not go unpunished.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6upLVSL1FOAHP	2025-03-14T16:42:39-07:00	
End Of Unipolarity: A Chance For Change – OpEd	Global conflict and uncertainty are nothing new, but since the 2008/09 economic crash, they have worsened exponentially. The arrival of President Trump has dramatically exacerbated the situation, turning turbulence into chaos and anxiety into fear. Governments and institutions are reeling after just seven weeks of Trump, his vice president J.D. Vance, and Elon 'Chainsaw' Musk—figures so extreme they make Trump seem moderate by comparison. It is impossible to keep track of the carnage (executive orders alone – 73 signed in the first 30 days). The strategy appears to be to overwhelm everyone – the Democrats (who appear shell shocked), foreign governments, the media, and the public, so nobody will notice the details. Since 20 January, a barrage of barbaric policy decisions and executive lunacy has flowed from the Oval Office, often involving actions that shatter tradition, flout the law, and violate the Constitution. A new world order and shifting alliances are in the air. Could the storm being unleashed by Trump and Co. inadvertently lead to positive structural and systemic change? Global Disruption The dominant global structure since the Second World War has been one of U.S. unipolarity, marked by global domination in which America has faced no significant competition or threat from other states. It is from this position—one that, in the American context, has bred increasing levels of paranoia—that Trump speaks when he says the U.S. will 'have' Gaza, based on American authority. Trump appears intent on breaking everything, destabilizing global institutions, and shattering long-held ideals like global unity, shared prosperity, and a 'one world' vision. Such concepts are being abandoned as international bodies are attacked and long-standing rules of global exchange are dismantled. At the stroke of a chunky black pen, the U.S. was formally withdrawn from several United Nations bodies, including the World Health Organization (its largest donor), the Human Rights Council (UNHRC), and UNRWA, the UN agency supporting Palestinians. The World Trade Organization (WTO) also faces threats due to Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. A review of U.S. involvement in UNESCO (the UN’s educational, scientific, and cultural agency) and U.S. funding for the United Nations itself has been ordered. Citing ‘the wild disparities in levels of funding among different countries,’ White House staff secretary Will Scharf explained that the decision was also a protest against ‘anti-American bias’ within UN agencies, though no specific examples of such prejudice were provided. Old alliances are hanging by a thread; the Palestinians’ right to a homeland has been swept aside, with ethnic cleansing of Gaza openly touted, and Israel given free rein to be even more barbaric—if such a thing is even possible. Aid organizations have been decimated, Europe and Ukraine are criticized, and Russia and Putin receive accolades. Canada and Greenland are eyed as potential U.S. states, and Trump wants to reclaim the Panama Canal and transform Gaza into a Palestinian-free Mediterranean resort under ‘American authority. Whatever disruptive actions Trump takes, others can—and potentially will—mimic, particularly other far-right leaders. This is especially troubling in relation to the Paris Agreement and global support for United Nations agencies. The UN is entirely reliant on member states for funding to carry out its life-saving work. Should nations begin to argue over their contributions and withhold payments, the valuable work the UN is doing around the world would be threatened The Trump Storm has thrown governments and organizations worldwide into turmoil, and after 70 years of U.S. hegemony, during which Western geopolitics and global affairs have overwhelmingly been designed and administered from Washington—often with disastrous consequences—there is talk of a new world order. It is not, however, a visionary, hopeful new world based on unifying principles and the oneness of humanity. Instead, it’s yet another divisive model rooted in power, ideology, and global dominance: Will China take over? Will Russia seek to expand its territory? What role will Europe play? Is the Trans-Atlantic Alliance shattered? And so on. The conversation centers around uncertainty, security, and defense capabilities. It’s more of the same unimaginative, duplicitous rhetoric we’ve heard for decades—a shocking reflection of the appalling quality of leaders currently in office, the corrupt nature of politics, and the extent to which the military-industrial complex and the corporate world hold sway. A Vision for Fundamental Change What is needed is not a new old world order, but a creative reimagining of civilization—a shift in values and ideals that shapes new and just systems and cultivates principles of goodness—cooperation, sharing, tolerance, and understanding. Gradual yet fundamental change that moves beyond manipulating existing patterns to establish a global order based on social justice and freedom; only this will lead to peace. While far-reaching reforms designed to bring about such change could, in principle, be introduced without the total destruction of existing systems, those in power—both political and corporate—having benefited the most, are determined to maintain the status quo, regardless of the consequences for society and the natural world. This leads to the rather depressing conclusion that only a seismic downfall will enable the changes billions of people around the world long for.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uq1SJkUpma6S	2025-03-14T16:41:09-07:00	
Forceful Taiwan Reunification: China’s Targeted Military And Civi...	By Suyash Desai (FPRI) -- For nearly a century, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan have largely avoided direct military confrontations across the Taiwan Strait. However, there have been four notable exceptions: the Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–55, 1958, 1995–96, and most recently, 2022–23. In the first three instances, the status quo was primarily restored following the crisis. However, recent events suggest worrying trends highlighting that Beijing is preparing for a forceful reunification with Taiwan. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping has already made reunification with Taiwan a part of his signature China Dream, announced during the 19th Party Congress meeting in 2017. However, this was not the first time Taiwan was featured prominently in speeches by top Chinese leaders. As political scientist Ketian Zhang highlights in her book China’s Gambit: The Calculus of Coercion, annexing Taiwan is considered a core interest of China, with official references to its significance appearing regularly since 2003. The most recent instance was Xi Jinping’s New Year’s speech on December 31, 2024, where he declared, 'No one can stop the historical trend of reunification of the motherland' (誰也不能充實祖國統一的歷史大勢). But beyond rhetoric and political posturing, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has taken concrete measures over the past decade to advance Beijing’s reunification agenda. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have intensified, reinforcing China’s willingness to use force. This article highlights the PLA’s systematic and incremental military and civilian-military measures—capabilities that might provide China with the tools to successfully conduct a potential forceful reunification with Taiwan in the near future. These measures include changing the institutions and patterns of PLA mobilization, constructing and using civilian infrastructure in military exercises, and establishing a new status quo through increasingly coercive military exercises around Taiwan. They also include standardization of the PLA for greater efficiency, effectiveness, combat readiness, stockpiling resources, and re-enlisting veterans with specific skills. This article builds upon Oriana Skylar Mastro’s arguments in her piece 'The Taiwan Temptation,' which contends that China’s expanding military capabilities and rising nationalism could drive Beijing to contemplate using force for reunification with Taiwan. It identifies granular military details, especially post-2020, but it doesn’t venture into arguments about the timing of the reunification, potential diplomatic backlash, or economic costs of the invasion. Recent Military-Civilian Measures Since 2015, the PRC has undertaken significant organizational, legal, and structural reforms to enhance the National Defense Mobilization System (NDMS) (國防動員系統). As China scholar Devin Thorne highlights in his recent testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, NDMS enables the PRC to harness its political, economic, technological, cultural, social, and other civilian resources from peacetime to wartime. This helps China to address a wide range of threats, such as escalations on its border, domestic instabilities, natural disasters, and other crises. It also bolsters China’s military logistics. As Thorne highlights, the key developments include the enactment of the National Defense Transportation Law in 2017, the introduction of updated auditing and surveying data on natural resources protocols in 2018 and 2021, the establishment of new NDMS offices beginning in December 2022, the creation of a new type of highly trained and professional local militia force since 2021, and the enhancement of cross-militia training initiatives starting in 2024. The PLA can mobilize private and civilian resources through the NDMS during national emergencies. It highlights China’s determination to prepare for potential contingencies, including escalation activities on its borders with India, the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea. Lessons from the Russian-Ukrainian War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have further shaped these efforts. Once operational, the NDMS would ultimately allow the PRC to mobilize society and harness civilian and military resources more systematically and institutionally in case of a potential forceful reunification attempt with Taiwan. However, mobilizing resources and force is insufficient, as China would need to reach the other side of the Taiwan Strait during a potential escalation. Some scholars dismiss the idea that the PLA remains incapable of conducting amphibious operations at the scale needed to take control of Taiwan. Amphibious operations (landing assault) are one of the five most important campaigns (alongside anti-landing, island blockade, border area counter-attack, and counter–air-raid campaigns) discussed at length in the PLA’s first written doctrine on joint operations, Joint Campaign Outline, as operational requirements to take over Taiwan by force. Taiwan has 169,000 active military personnel, backed by 1.66 million reservists. As career naval officer Harlan Ullman explains, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, the PLA would need to mobilize at least 507,000 soldiers. By extension, to cross the 106-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait to conduct landing operations, China would need thousands of ships—far more than the current PLA Navy capabilities of 234 operating warships. However, China has long been working to mobilize its civilian infrastructure to support its military campaign. For instance, the PRC has emphasized the construction of roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) (滾裝船) ships, which can use their power to set up ramps on docks or beaches to transport vehicles. Each RO–RO ship is estimated to carry at least three hundred vehicles and about fifteen hundred passengers. Since establishing the 'strategic projection support ship fleets' in China’s major ship-building companies in 2012, the PLA has actively cooperated with local shipping companies to improve maritime 'strategic delivery' capabilities by prioritizing the production of RO-RO ferries. According to naval strategist J. Michael Dahm, in January 2023, China had around thirty-one RO-RO ferries in operation. However, the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out that the mainland shipyards would deliver up to two hundred RO-RO ships in the four years from 2023 to 2026. Furthermore, the PLA has used these ferries in military exercises in the Taiwan Strait since 2019. For instance, the first fifteen-thousand-ton ferry, Bang Chui Dao RO-RO ship (棒槌島滾裝船), participated in an amphibious assault exercise in 2019. Since then, the PLA has conducted such military exercises regularly. In July 2020, the PLA experimented with launching amphibious assault craft from civilian ferries toward the beach rather than port facilities, and it conducted day and night exercises off the coast of Guangdong Province. August 2021 was the first time the PLA used a ten-thousand-ton–class civilian ferry ship to land military exercises. Furthermore, in August 2022, after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, six of these RO-RO ships, which are operated by the Bo Hai Ferry Group Company (渤海輪渡集團公司) and are affiliated with the PLA Maritime Militia 8th Transport Brigade (海上民兵第8運輸旅), headed south toward Xiamen—the closest point to Taiwan. The RO-RO ferries were used more frequently in cross-transportation military exercises in July and September 2023. Furthermore, it was also discovered in January 2025 that China is building at least five landing barges at the Guangzhou shipyard with unusually long road bridges that extend from the bow of the ship, which makes them relevant to amphibious landing operations. Although these vessels and barges are extremely susceptible to attacks from Taiwanese F-16s, warships, and submarines, they would be supported by the PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, and PLA Rocket Force. The Changing Nature of Coercion and Military Exercises around Taiwan On September 17, 2020, the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense published its first real-time military update, documenting PLA incursions into Taiwan’s de facto air defense identification zone (ADIZ). As meticulously recorded by Ben Lewis and Gerald C. Brown, by January 2025, there had been approximately eight thousand PLA violations of the ADIZ, including multiple crossings of the median line. Notably, Chinese warplanes crossed the median line in 2019 for the first time since 1999. However, Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan provided the PLA with a pretext to escalate its activities, culminating in multiple advanced military exercises conducted around Taiwan from all sides. Since August 2022, the PLA has conducted five large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. Most of them coincided with significant political events. For instance, the first military exercise in August 2022 followed Pelosi’s visit. This was succeeded by the inaugural PLA Joint Sword exercises in April 2023, coinciding with former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to the United States and her meeting with then-Speaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy. Subsequent exercises included Joint Sword A in May 2024 and Joint Sword B in October 2024. These exercises aligned with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te’s tenure and his National Day speech. The most recent military exercises, conducted in December 2024, were held shortly after President Lai Ching-te’s travels through the United States. Notably, President Lai did not engage with any major US leaders during his transit. However, the recent exercises display the opportunistic Chinese behavior of leveraging situations to establish a new normal through increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait. The Joint Sword A and B exercises and the December 2024 drills are particularly significant for understanding the evolution of China’s coercion pattern and the difference between China’s military posturing and its intentions in the Taiwan Strait. While the Joint Sword A and B drills were declared in advance and focused on anti-intervention and amphibious assault near Taiwan, recent December 2024 exercises intended to perform blockade, strategic deterrence, and anti-interventionism exercises. The latest exercises occurred across expanded locations like Fujian, Zhejiang, and the Western Pacific. Significantly, the December 2024 exercise, for the first time, witnessed all three of the PLA’s sea-facing theater commands—North, East, and South—jointly participating in an operation in the eastern waters of China, a key demand by the leadership to achieve multi-domain joint operations capabilities. Notably, these instances reveal that the Chinese leadership is keenly aware of the PLA’s pre-existing weaknesses, like amphibious assaults and anti-intervention operations, and has been pushing the PLA to address this gap gradually. They also leveraged elements of strategic deterrence and surprise while adhering to steps toward joint combat operations, a prerequisite for a forceful reunification. Geographically, these exercises extended beyond the Taiwan Strait to cover broader areas, including Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and the Western Pacific, indicating a shift toward controlling key maritime zones in the First Island Chain. Thus, with active participation from all major PLA services and the three sea-facing theater commands, and indulgence in numerous aspects of warfare targeted toward the PLA’s primary strategic direction—Taiwan—these exercises signalled a more nuanced and multi-layered operational focus. Multiple Standardizations within the PLA Over the past seven years, particularly in the post-pandemic period, China has prioritized comprehensive standardization of procedures with the PLA and its auxiliary support systems—non-combat systems and components that support and sustain military operations. PLA leadership has issued numerous directives to achieve uniformity across various domains, such as the construction of barracks, military equipment procurement, and the establishment of standardized military training grounds. These efforts are extended to standardizing resource allocation, engineering procurement, equipment support, logistical operations, medical services, communication infrastructure, cybersecurity systems, and intelligence gathering and analysis mechanisms. These initiatives highlight China’s attempt to enable standardization within the PLA’s military operations to enhance its overall efficiency, effectiveness, and combat readiness. Streamlining key processes, including operational logistics, equipment maintenance, and strategic communication networks, would help the PLA to accelerate achieving capabilities to perform multi-domain integrated joint operations. Standardization facilitates interoperability across services, theaters, and arms, resulting in seamless coordination among ground, naval, air, space, and cyber units. Developing these capabilities is a prerequisite for conducting multi-domain integrated joint operations, a requirement for forceful Taiwan reunification. They are also indicative of the PLA’s steps toward achieving operational readiness. It is particularly relevant in regional and near-regional escalations, such as those in the South China Sea and the Western Pacific Ocean, which could be possibilities during the Taiwan reunification campaign. Resource Stockpiling Resource stockpiling is an important indicator of a nation’s preparedness for a potential conflict. It involves the systematic accumulation of critical materials, energy reserves, food supplies, and industrial inputs essential during wartime. Such activities are often undertaken to ensure self-sufficiency, mitigate vulnerabilities, and maintain resilience in the face of potential embargoes, trade disruptions, or blockades. Agricultural economist Gustavo F.C. Ferreira highlights in his testimony to the US-China Economy and Security Review Commission that China has been significantly increasing its energy resource reserves, particularly coal, crude oil, and natural gas. The country has built an extensive storage capacity for crude oil, estimated to exceed 1.8 billion barrels, including strategic petroleum reserves and underground storage facilities. Additionally, he points out that China’s coal production has ramped up aggressively, with approval of expansion projects equivalent to the European Union’s annual coal production in just one year. He notes that beyond energy resources, the stockpiling extends to other critical areas such as food (grains and protein sources), strategic metals (rare earth, copper, and lithium), and technological components (semiconductors). These measures are supported by state policies to reduce China’s reliance on global markets and ensure continued operation during a conflict or escalation. Similarly, there are reports about China’s record 105.03-million-metric-ton import of soybeans in 2024. This marks a 6.5 percent increase from 2023. This surge is possibly due to China’s efforts to prepare for a contingency, particularly in anticipation of intensified trade tensions with the United States. Researcher Zongyuan Zoe Liu’s work highlights China’s strategies to shield its economy from potential Western sanctions by drawing lessons from sanctions imposed on Russia. She notes China’s attempt to increase economic and technological self-sufficiencies by immunizing its economy against sanctions and building financial resilience against potential sanctions by the United States. Re-enlistment of Veterans Since 2017, the PLA has notified several enlistment orders for veterans with specific skill sets. A key focus has been the integration of veterans into civil-military roles. This is supported by policies to re-enlist them in specialized units adhering to Xi’s stated and revealed military goals for the PLA. For instance, in the case of Taiwan-focused operations, the PLA’s re-enlistment efforts focus on operational readiness by re-enlisting veterans skilled in amphibious operations, cyber warfare, and missile systems. Since 2022, there has been an emphasis on integrating these veterans into critical roles, such as reserve forces, militia coordination, and rapid mobilization units. Beyond these six measures, several other developments—China’s heavy investment in dual-use infrastructure such as ports and airfields on the east coast, development of amphibious and airborne military capabilities like the large Type 075 landing ships and Y-20 aircraft, investment in offensive intelligence and cyber capabilities, deployment of strategic missile systems like the DF-15 and DF-21, training of the maritime militia with the PLA and their expansion to support the armed forces whenever required, and the integration of real-time battlefield awareness via the BeiDou navigation system—are additional factors to conclusively determine the PLA’s intention and readiness for a potential reunification campaign with Taiwan. Conclusion It is a political decision to pursue the reunification campaign. Western scholars dismiss such arguments on the basis of the PLA’s perceived lack of military preparedness and the significant economic costs China would incur during and after a reunification attempt. However, as this essay highlights, China is keenly aware of these considerations and is taking proactive steps to limit the fallout, if not eliminate it. This essay doesn’t argue whether China would attempt a forceful unification campaign or the cost of its campaign. Instead, it argues that through a combination of military and civilian measures, an effort has been made to address the possible critical vulnerabilities in military and economic sectors. The question remains about the PLA’s ability to execute and sustain complex cross-strait operations, especially after targeted military purges in 2023 and 2024. Every measure mentioned here can be seen in isolation and not as a part of a complex puzzle that indicates that the PLA is preparing to invade Taiwan. However, these measures involve systemic integration with military logistics, enabling rapid deployment and sustainability when required. A steady accumulation of capabilities indicates deliberate preparation for eventualities that may align with China’s political-military objectives across the Taiwan Strait.

Forceful Taiwan Reunification: China’s Targeted Military And Civi...	By Suyash Desai (FPRI) -- For nearly a century, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan have largely avoided direct military confrontations across the Taiwan Strait. However, there have been four notable exceptions: the Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–55, 1958, 1995–96, and most recently, 2022–23. In the first three instances, the status quo was primarily restored following the crisis. However, recent events suggest worrying trends highlighting that Beijing is preparing for a forceful reunification with Taiwan. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping has already made reunification with Taiwan a part of his signature China Dream, announced during the 19th Party Congress meeting in 2017. However, this was not the first time Taiwan was featured prominently in speeches by top Chinese leaders. As political scientist Ketian Zhang highlights in her book China’s Gambit: The Calculus of Coercion, annexing Taiwan is considered a core interest of China, with official references to its significance appearing regularly since 2003. The most recent instance was Xi Jinping’s New Year’s speech on December 31, 2024, where he declared, 'No one can stop the historical trend of reunification of the motherland' (誰也不能充實祖國統一的歷史大勢). But beyond rhetoric and political posturing, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has taken concrete measures over the past decade to advance Beijing’s reunification agenda. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have intensified, reinforcing China’s willingness to use force. This article highlights the PLA’s systematic and incremental military and civilian-military measures—capabilities that might provide China with the tools to successfully conduct a potential forceful reunification with Taiwan in the near future. These measures include changing the institutions and patterns of PLA mobilization, constructing and using civilian infrastructure in military exercises, and establishing a new status quo through increasingly coercive military exercises around Taiwan. They also include standardization of the PLA for greater efficiency, effectiveness, combat readiness, stockpiling resources, and re-enlisting veterans with specific skills. This article builds upon Oriana Skylar Mastro’s arguments in her piece 'The Taiwan Temptation,' which contends that China’s expanding military capabilities and rising nationalism could drive Beijing to contemplate using force for reunification with Taiwan. It identifies granular military details, especially post-2020, but it doesn’t venture into arguments about the timing of the reunification, potential diplomatic backlash, or economic costs of the invasion. Recent Military-Civilian Measures Since 2015, the PRC has undertaken significant organizational, legal, and structural reforms to enhance the National Defense Mobilization System (NDMS) (國防動員系統). As China scholar Devin Thorne highlights in his recent testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, NDMS enables the PRC to harness its political, economic, technological, cultural, social, and other civilian resources from peacetime to wartime. This helps China to address a wide range of threats, such as escalations on its border, domestic instabilities, natural disasters, and other crises. It also bolsters China’s military logistics. As Thorne highlights, the key developments include the enactment of the National Defense Transportation Law in 2017, the introduction of updated auditing and surveying data on natural resources protocols in 2018 and 2021, the establishment of new NDMS offices beginning in December 2022, the creation of a new type of highly trained and professional local militia force since 2021, and the enhancement of cross-militia training initiatives starting in 2024. The PLA can mobilize private and civilian resources through the NDMS during national emergencies. It highlights China’s determination to prepare for potential contingencies, including escalation activities on its borders with India, the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea. Lessons from the Russian-Ukrainian War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have further shaped these efforts. Once operational, the NDMS would ultimately allow the PRC to mobilize society and harness civilian and military resources more systematically and institutionally in case of a potential forceful reunification attempt with Taiwan. However, mobilizing resources and force is insufficient, as China would need to reach the other side of the Taiwan Strait during a potential escalation. Some scholars dismiss the idea that the PLA remains incapable of conducting amphibious operations at the scale needed to take control of Taiwan. Amphibious operations (landing assault) are one of the five most important campaigns (alongside anti-landing, island blockade, border area counter-attack, and counter–air-raid campaigns) discussed at length in the PLA’s first written doctrine on joint operations, Joint Campaign Outline, as operational requirements to take over Taiwan by force. Taiwan has 169,000 active military personnel, backed by 1.66 million reservists. As career naval officer Harlan Ullman explains, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, the PLA would need to mobilize at least 507,000 soldiers. By extension, to cross the 106-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait to conduct landing operations, China would need thousands of ships—far more than the current PLA Navy capabilities of 234 operating warships. However, China has long been working to mobilize its civilian infrastructure to support its military campaign. For instance, the PRC has emphasized the construction of roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) (滾裝船) ships, which can use their power to set up ramps on docks or beaches to transport vehicles. Each RO–RO ship is estimated to carry at least three hundred vehicles and about fifteen hundred passengers. Since establishing the 'strategic projection support ship fleets' in China’s major ship-building companies in 2012, the PLA has actively cooperated with local shipping companies to improve maritime 'strategic delivery' capabilities by prioritizing the production of RO-RO ferries. According to naval strategist J. Michael Dahm, in January 2023, China had around thirty-one RO-RO ferries in operation. However, the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out that the mainland shipyards would deliver up to two hundred RO-RO ships in the four years from 2023 to 2026. Furthermore, the PLA has used these ferries in military exercises in the Taiwan Strait since 2019. For instance, the first fifteen-thousand-ton ferry, Bang Chui Dao RO-RO ship (棒槌島滾裝船), participated in an amphibious assault exercise in 2019. Since then, the PLA has conducted such military exercises regularly. In July 2020, the PLA experimented with launching amphibious assault craft from civilian ferries toward the beach rather than port facilities, and it conducted day and night exercises off the coast of Guangdong Province. August 2021 was the first time the PLA used a ten-thousand-ton–class civilian ferry ship to land military exercises. Furthermore, in August 2022, after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, six of these RO-RO ships, which are operated by the Bo Hai Ferry Group Company (渤海輪渡集團公司) and are affiliated with the PLA Maritime Militia 8th Transport Brigade (海上民兵第8運輸旅), headed south toward Xiamen—the closest point to Taiwan. The RO-RO ferries were used more frequently in cross-transportation military exercises in July and September 2023. Furthermore, it was also discovered in January 2025 that China is building at least five landing barges at the Guangzhou shipyard with unusually long road bridges that extend from the bow of the ship, which makes them relevant to amphibious landing operations. Although these vessels and barges are extremely susceptible to attacks from Taiwanese F-16s, warships, and submarines, they would be supported by the PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, and PLA Rocket Force. The Changing Nature of Coercion and Military Exercises around Taiwan On September 17, 2020, the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense published its first real-time military update, documenting PLA incursions into Taiwan’s de facto air defense identification zone (ADIZ). As meticulously recorded by Ben Lewis and Gerald C. Brown, by January 2025, there had been approximately eight thousand PLA violations of the ADIZ, including multiple crossings of the median line. Notably, Chinese warplanes crossed the median line in 2019 for the first time since 1999. However, Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan provided the PLA with a pretext to escalate its activities, culminating in multiple advanced military exercises conducted around Taiwan from all sides. Since August 2022, the PLA has conducted five large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. Most of them coincided with significant political events. For instance, the first military exercise in August 2022 followed Pelosi’s visit. This was succeeded by the inaugural PLA Joint Sword exercises in April 2023, coinciding with former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to the United States and her meeting with then-Speaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy. Subsequent exercises included Joint Sword A in May 2024 and Joint Sword B in October 2024. These exercises aligned with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te’s tenure and his National Day speech. The most recent military exercises, conducted in December 2024, were held shortly after President Lai Ching-te’s travels through the United States. Notably, President Lai did not engage with any major US leaders during his transit. However, the recent exercises display the opportunistic Chinese behavior of leveraging situations to establish a new normal through increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait. The Joint Sword A and B exercises and the December 2024 drills are particularly significant for understanding the evolution of China’s coercion pattern and the difference between China’s military posturing and its intentions in the Taiwan Strait. While the Joint Sword A and B drills were declared in advance and focused on anti-intervention and amphibious assault near Taiwan, recent December 2024 exercises intended to perform blockade, strategic deterrence, and anti-interventionism exercises.

Renewed US–China Tensions Spell Trouble For Australia’s Economy –...	By Madison Cartwright Trump 2.0 is in full swing and it is already causing major anxieties for the global economy. Australia must navigate US–China tensions with careful consideration of its economic realities. Ongoing negotiations for exemptions from US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported metals do not shield Australia from reinvigorated US protectionism, especially as most of Trump’s ire has been targeted at China. While Australia’s trade relationship with China gets a lot of attention, its importance is not always fully grasped. Australia’s access to the Chinese market has significantly impacted how Australia’s political economy developed, creating path dependencies that are costly to break. The China-fuelled mining boom of the 2000s influenced the allocation of economic resources, raised its standard of living and affected its political culture. It has also shaped expectations on government dealings with issues like fiscal policy and economic prosperity that benefit from the booming Chinese commodity imports and deflationary exports. What about now? When China banned Australian coal imports in 2020, many assumed that the industry would be devastated. Yet it was not. Australia found other buyers for its coal. In 2021, China accounted for less than 1 per cent of its coal exports, even as Australia’s total coal exports increased by US$19 billion. By 2023, trade in coal had resumed but China still accounted for only 8 per cent of Australian coal exports, less than half the share in 2020. If Australia could adapt to losing the Chinese market for its coal, will Trump’s tariffs on China really be so bad? It is important not to draw the wrong lessons from this experience. Australia’s vulnerability lies in how much its exports rely on the Chinese market, the high share of these goods on Australia’s total exports and China’s share of the market for these goods globally. Energy is crucial to Australia’s trade with China, but its most important commodity is by far iron ore. In 2023, China purchased 84 per cent of Australia’s US$85.4 billion iron ore exports. Iron ore accounted for 23 per cent of Australia’s total exports in 2023. Finding alternative buyers would be difficult — China purchased 69 per cent of global iron ore exports in the same year. Australia’s third largest export is petroleum gas, with a 13 per cent share of its export mix. China, the largest importer of petroleum gas in the world, accounts for just under a third of these exports. China is a big importer of Australian services as well as goods. In the 2024 financial year, China was the largest importer of Australian education services, with a 24 per cent share. Australia’s trade surplus with China accounted for 4 per cent of its GDP in the 2024 financial year. The growth in the trade surplus with China also accounted for 10 per cent of the growth in GDP — measured in current prices — from 2023–24. If the trade surplus with China was to shrink or even fail to grow due to tariffs imposed by Trump, it would have a significant impact on Australia’s economy. Australia must also understand that the threat is not just tariffs or Trump. Political consensus on US–China economic relations is souring in the United States. Trump started the trade war with China in 2018, but president Joe Biden retained the Trump-era tariffs. Trump first sanctioned Huawei and proposed a ban on TikTok, but Biden expanded these sanctions to the entire Chinese semiconductor industry and shepherded a TikTok ban through Congress. China is flexing its economic power too, imposing its own export bans on materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Rising economic tensions between the United States and China is the new normal — and Australia is caught in the middle. The big risk for Australia is increasing US demands on its allies to join efforts to decouple from China. This is happening in semiconductors already. Can we expect the United States to demand Australia to follow a path of decoupling from China or else face sanctions, risks to AUKUS and ANZUS or other forms of coercion? And what would that mean for Australia’s economy, standard of living and political stability? These are the questions Canberra should be considering. Decoupling from China will be costly for Australia not just because of exports. If Australia and other US allies stop buying Chinese computers, toys or smartphones, where will they turn? China supplies 49, 60 and 59 per cent of global exports of these products respectively and dominates many other markets. Of course, all of this could be manufactured elsewhere, but that would require substantial investment in domestic manufacturing or foreign production. It could also significantly increase inflation, as new manufacturing would likely incur higher costs. Meanwhile, Australia’s ability to afford these higher priced imports would weaken as foreign exchange earnings from commodity exports and mining investments decline, ultimately lowering incomes. Despite the legitimate security concerns over China’s policies, Australia must be realistic about its economic vulnerabilities. The Australian government should embrace the ‘pragmatic’ approach that had previously characterised Australia’s foreign policy towards China. Policymakers should also focus on deepening ties within the Asia Pacific to reduce Australia’s security reliance on the United States and economic reliance on China. Existing institutions, such as the ASEAN-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, provide good mediums to engage with China productively. Cooperation with other regional actors which face common challenges is key to navigating the ramifications of rising great power tensions.

Meanwhile, Australia’s ability to afford these higher priced imports would weaken as foreign exchange earnings from commodity exports and mining investments decline, ultimately lowering incomes. Despite the legitimate security concerns over China’s policies, Australia must be realistic about its economic vulnerabilities. The Australian government should embrace the ‘pragmatic’ approach that had previously characterised Australia’s foreign policy towards China. Policymakers should also focus on deepening ties within the Asia Pacific to reduce Australia’s security reliance on the United States and economic reliance on China. Existing institutions, such as the ASEAN-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, provide good mediums to engage with China productively. Cooperation with other regional actors which face common challenges is key to navigating the ramifications of rising great power tensions.

Why Did The ICC Arrest Ex-Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte? –...	By Jason Gutierrez Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is in custody after authorities in his home country arrested him on a warrant from the International Criminal Court and put him on a plane bound for the Netherlands, where the world court is headquartered. Philippine authorities had served Duterte with an arrest warrant from the ICC, as part of the court’s years-long investigation into his past administration’s bloody crackdown on illegal drugs. The 79-year-old Duterte was arrested in Manila on Tuesday as he disembarked from a flight from Hong Kong. He was held for hours at an air base next to Manila’s international airport before being put on another plane that whisked him away to The Hague. Here’s what you need to know about the ICC arrest order against Duterte: What are the potential charges against Duterte? As detailed in the ICC warrant, the former leader stands accused of committing crimes against humanity in connection with thousands of killings that occurred during a counter-narcotics crackdown under his watch as president (2016-22) and dating back to 2011, when he served as mayor of southern Davao city. Human Rights Watch and other rights advocacy group have said that the police under Duterte had regularly falsified evidence to justify the killings of suspected drug dealers and addicts. The Philippine government has given conflicting figures on how many people were killed in his administration’s so-called drug war. The last figure it gave was 6,252 suspects, who were killed from July 1, 2016 to May 31, 2022. Rights groups, however, have put the death toll as high as 20,000-plus. They have noted that statistics for many of those who were killed had been placed into the government’s 'death under investigation' category, and were therefore not logged as fatalities of Duterte’s anti-narcotics campaign. What evidence is there that Philippine police used excessive force? Evidence has been piling up. Eight police officers have so far been convicted of murder carried out in the name of the drug war. In June 2024, a court convicted four officers for the September 2016 killing of Luis Bonifacio, 45, and his 19-year-old son, Gabriel, inside their home. The court had said the victims’ injuries – including multiple gunshot wounds to their bodies – 'glaringly show the brutality employed upon them, despite the pleading for mercy of the victims.' In November 2018, a court in northern Manila convicted three police officers for killing 17-year-old teenager Kian Loyd delos Santos while he begged for mercy. It was not a shootout as police had claimed, and evidence later showed that he was also mistakenly killed. His death galvanized opposition to Duterte’s drug war. In March 2023, another policeman was found guilty of torturing two teenagers who were later found dead. Duterte has made no effort to hide his 'kill, kill, kill' order, and during his appearance before Congress in October, doubled down on his reason for doing so. 'If you think you will be killed, shoot him in the head. That would be one less criminal,' Duterte had said. He also admitted to the existence of his own private army, 'I can make the confession now if you want. I’m really doing it, but don’t involve the police,' Duterte told the hearing. 'I have a death squad, seven men, but they’re not police. They’re gangsters.' The former president refused to name them. Is the ICC arrest warrant still valid, given that the Philippines withdrew from the world court under President Duterte? The warrant is valid because the ICC jurisdiction covers crimes that took place before the Philippines withdrew from the statute that created the international court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands. However, crimes committed after the country’s withdrawal – which took effect on March 17, 2019 – aren’t covered. Does the ICC still have jurisdiction over Philippine cases? As a court of last resort, the ICC prosecutes cases only when a government is unwilling or unable to do so 'genuinely.' Duterte’s arrest on Tuesday was a sign that the ICC felt that the Philippines could not or would not conduct genuine investigations into the allegations. What are the political ramifications of Duterte’s international arrest? The Duterte and Marcos families are two of the leading political families in the Philippines. But Rodrigo Duterte has been openly feuding with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and has repeatedly taunted the chief executive in public appearances. Sara Duterte, Marcos’ vice president, is the former leader’s daughter. Despite leading in popularity surveys before the 2022 presidential election, Sara Duterte successfully opted to contest the polls as Marcos’ running mate. The political alliance, which trampled the opposition in the May 2022 national polls, ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the Marcos government to allow an international investigation into the drug war waged by former President Duterte. Last month, the House of Representatives impeached Sara Duterte for alleged constitutional violations, corruption, plotting to assassinate Marcos, betrayal of public trust and other high crimes – accusations which her family rejected as 'political persecution.' She is expected to face an impeachment trial before the Senate later this year.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlKAsEdqddXRp	2025-03-11T17:45:46-07:00

Conclave: Is A Hungarian Pope In The Smoke? – Analysis	Prominent among candidates to succeed Pope Francis is Hungary’s primate, Cardinal Peter Erdo. His potential election raises questions about both the direction of global Catholicism and Viktor Orban’s scope to wield influence through the Vatican. By Alexander Faludy The 72-year-old Hungarian primate Peter Erdo is tipped as a frontrunner among the candidates to succeed Pope Francis: the 88-year-old pontiff has now been under treatment in Rome’s Gemelli hospital for over three weeks, where his condition continues to be described as 'complex'. Cardinal Erdo is a popular figure internationally among conservative Catholics, and has had a close – if sometimes complicated – relationship with Hungary’s nationalist-populist government since Fidesz returned to power in 2010. Erdo became archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, and a cardinal, in 2003. A distinguished church lawyer, he first developed an international profile by leading the Council of Bishops' Conferences of Europe (CCEE), the representative body for Europe’s Catholic bishops, from 2006 to 2016. As rapporteur for the global Synod on the Family (2014-15), he resisted radical change to the church’s approach to divorced and gay Christians. His efforts, although not fully successful in halting reforms, won him sympathy among conservatives in Africa and America. More recently, his response to Pope Francis’s decree Fiducia Supplicans (December 2023), which permitted priests to bless same-sex couples informally, challenged the Vatican position. Preaching at midnight mass in Budapest’s St Stephen’s Basilica in December 2023, Erdo stated: 'If we are Christians, we must not only follow a pious philanthropic philosophy, perhaps with content that changes every decade according to fashion.' Instead, he said, 'the teachings, life, death and resurrection of Jesus are the eternal standard.' His words were widely viewed as a veiled criticism of the decree. Even so, Erdo, who is generally guarded in public statements, may still be able to position himself as a compromise candidate, offering the church an interval of calm after a period of accelerated change under Pope Francis. 'He is conservative but not reactionary, and comes across as both pragmatic and diplomatic,' observes Zoltan Laky, a Catholic journalist with the Hungarian outlet Valasz Online. While resistant to radical departures from church teaching, Erdo 'lacks the confrontational tone of some traditionalists', Laky continues, meaning that in the conclave he could 'appeal to both traditionalists and to moderate progressives as a stabilising force'. Orban’s man in the Vatican? The degree of Hungarian government interest in Erdo’s possible election worries some observers. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hinted at his concern with the topic in his annual set-piece policy speech at the Fidesz summer camp in the Romanian spa town of Ballie Tusnad in July 2024. Citing a number of historical missteps from which Hungary should learn lessons for its geopolitical positioning, Orban included the country’s failure in 1513 to secure the papal election of the Hungarian candidate Tamas Bakocz. This has prompted obvious questions about the example’s contemporary relevance. Fidesz communications efforts reveal clear signs of support for Erdo’s papal candidacy. According to BIRN’s sources, Catholic Church affairs are a 'restricted topic' for the government- and Fidesz-controlled media in Hungary, one on which journalists are known to require special clearance to write about. Notably, each time Erdo’s possible election to the papacy is mentioned in the foreign press, that is immediately reported by such outlets as a news item in its own right. Hungarian reporting of the foreign coverage is then, in turn, amplified in English translation on the websites of Fidesz-organised ‘civil’ organisations, suggesting a co-ordinated strategy to drive discussion of the topic. Erdo’s candidacy may also have been boosted by the 2021 International Eucharistic Congress in Budapest, attended by several hundred bishops and cardinals from around the world. This congress provided Erdo with a platform to impress peers and make useful connections, The event was underwritten by the Hungarian state at a cost of about 80 million euros. Such an approach would echo, in both objective and technique, the successful efforts of Hungary’s Cold War Communist regime to secure the election of Bishop Zoltan Kaldy as president of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). The latter was achieved at the 1984 meeting of the LWF General Assembly in Budapest, again hosted at government expense and preceded by a focused international influence campaign lasting several years. Lately, Hungary has also played host to a number of individual visits by cardinal electors (and potential electors) attending conferences and events at a frequency surprising relative to Hungary’s size and location. Program costs for such visits are underwritten by government bodies, including the Prime Minister’s Office and the State Secretariat for Assisting Persecuted Christians. A mixed record During the 2015 migration crisis, Erdo declined to criticise the government’s hostile messaging about migrants, and in 2016 stormed out of a live TV interview when asked if Fidesz’s vilification of asylum-seekers was compatible with Catholic teaching on compassion for such people. He has also been silent in the face of the effective criminalisation of homelessness in a 2018 annexe to the constitution and the introduction of Russian-style legislation stigmatising the LGBTQ+ community in 2021. 'Not once did Peter Erdo speak out; he did not take the opportunity of prophetic criticism,' accuses Dr Rita Perintfalvi, a lay Catholic theologian from Hungary who teaches at the University of Graz in Austria. Indeed, Perintfalvi claims that when it comes to the mistreatment of vulnerable minorities, 'it has become clear that if Peter Erdo has to choose between papal guidance and the Hungarian government’s view on how churches should behave, he will always choose the latter.' The cardinal has also been notably silent on democratic backsliding in Hungary, rampant corruption, and the restriction of freedom of religion or belief for smaller faith communities. Yet Erdo’s relationship with Fidesz has not always been smooth. He opposed introducing compulsory religious education in Hungary’s state schools in 2013, warning it would compromise the viability of church youth groups, and he critiqued the quality of religion textbooks devised by government educators to support the curriculum. His opposition, together with other bishops, to the nationalisation of Hungary’s IVF clinics, citing church teaching on bioethics, caused an 18-month delay in implementing the policy while Fidesz unsuccessfully sought compromise with the church. The dispute occasioned public friction with then families minister (and later president) Katalin Novak. Overall, according to Zoltan Laky, 'While he [Erdo] hasn’t fully upheld the Church’s independence from political entanglements, neither did he align as closely with Viktor Orban’s government as have some other bishops.' Perintfalvi is more pessimistic: 'At a time when we are on the brink of the third world war and when Western civilisation, democracy and the future of human rights are at stake, I think the election of such a man as pope would be a disaster.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlA8wE549_9fD	2025-03-11T17:44:06-07:00

Ukraine World’s Biggest Arms Importer: US’ Dominance Of Global Ar...	Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but Russia (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind France (9.6 per cent), while Italy (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period. ‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘However, some major arms importers, including Saudi Arabia, India and China, saw large declines in import volumes for a variety of reasons, despite high threat perceptions in their regions.’ European NATO members increase dependence on US-supplied arms Arms imports by the European NATO members more than doubled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+105 per cent). The USA supplied 64 per cent of these arms, a substantially larger share than in 2015–19 (52 per cent). The other main suppliers were France and South Korea (accounting for 6.5 per cent each), Germany (4.7 per cent) and Israel (3.9 per cent). ‘With an increasingly belligerent Russia and transatlantic relations under stress during the first Trump presidency, European NATO states have taken steps to reduce their dependence on arms imports and to strengthen the European arms industry,’ said Pieter Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘But the transatlantic arms-supply relationship has deep roots. Imports from the USA have risen and European NATO states have almost 500 combat aircraft and many other weapons still on order from the USA.’ USA further increases its share of arms exports, while Russian exports slide Arms exports by the USA increased by 21 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and its share of global arms exports grew from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. The USA supplied major arms to 107 states in 2020–24. For the first time in two decades, the largest share of US arms exports in 2020–24 went to Europe (35 per cent) rather than the Middle East (33 per cent). Nevertheless, the top single recipient of US arms was Saudi Arabia (12 per cent of US arms exports). ‘The USA is in a unique position when it comes to arms exports. At 43 per cent, its share of global arms exports is more than four times as much as the next-largest exporter, France,’ said Mathew George. ‘The USA continues to be the supplier of choice for advanced long-range strike capabilities like combat aircraft.’ In contrast to the USA, arms exports by Russia fell sharply (–64 per cent) between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. ‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. ‘Two of Russia’s most important arms-trading relationships had already weakened before 2022, with India increasingly favouring other suppliers, and China sourcing more arms from its own burgeoning arms industry.’ Russia delivered major arms to 33 states in 2020–24. Two thirds of Russian arms exports went to three states: India (38 per cent), China (17 per cent) and Kazakhstan (11 per cent). France became the world’s second largest arms supplier in 2020–24, delivering arms to 65 states. France’s exports of major arms to other European states almost trebled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+187 per cent). This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The second largest recipient of major arms from France was Qatar (9.7 per cent of French arms exports). China was the fourth largest exporter of arms in 2020–24, with 5.9 per cent of global arms exports. Despite China’s efforts to increase its arms exports, many large importers do not buy Chinese arms for political reasons. Asia and Oceania remains largest arms-importing region; China’s imports more than halve The share of global arms transfers going to states in Asia and Oceania fell from 41 per cent to 33 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. A 21 per cent drop in imports to the region was in large part due to arms imports by China shrinking by 64 per cent between the two periods, as it increasingly substituted imports—mainly from Russia—with locally designed and produced weapon systems. China’s arms imports are likely to keep falling as the capacity of its domestic arms industry grows. Four states in Asia and Oceania ranked among the 10 largest arms importers globally in 2020–24: India, Pakistan, Japan and Australia. China dropped out of the top 10 arms importers for the first time since 1990–94. The main suppliers to the region in 2020–24 were the USA, which accounted for 37 per cent of regional arms imports, Russia (17 per cent) and China (14 per cent). India was the world’s second largest arms importer, with its imports reflecting perceived threats from both China and Pakistan. However, its imports decreased by 9.3 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The largest share of Indian arms imports (36 per cent) came from Russia, a significantly smaller share than in 2015–19 (55 per cent) and 2010–14 (72 per cent). Arms imports by Pakistan grew by 61 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. China became even more dominant as its supplier, accounting for 81 per cent of Pakistan’s arms imports in 2020–24, compared with 74 per cent in 2015–19. With the sharp drop in China’s arms imports, and marked decreases in imports by Taiwan (–27 per cent) and South Korea (–24 per cent), arms imports by East Asian states shrank by 22 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. Japan (+93 per cent) was the only East Asian state that saw an increase in its arms imports. ‘While arms imports to Europe and the Middle East continue to grab media attention, Asia and Oceania remained the largest arms-importing region in the world in 2020–24, as it has been almost invariably since the early 1990s,’ said Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Threat perceptions concerning China are behind much of the arms procurement in the region.’ Middle East arms imports dip Arms imports by states in the Middle East fell by 20 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. Four of the top 10 global importers in 2020–24 were in the Middle East: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait. Qatar was the world’s third largest arms importer in 2020–24 (up from 10th largest in 2015–19). Between 2015–19 and 2020–24, Saudi Arabia’s arms imports decreased by 41 per cent. More than half of arms imports to the Middle East came from the USA (52 per cent), while 13 per cent came from Italy, 9.8 per cent from France and 7.6 per cent from Germany. ‘Regional conflicts and tensions continue to drive demand for arms imports in the Middle East,’ said Zain Hussain, Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Given the volume of pending deliveries, the Middle East will remain a major arms-importing region.’ Despite the ongoing war in Gaza, arms imports by Israel remained largely stable between 2015–19 and 2020–24. In 2020–24 the USA supplied the biggest share of Israel’s arms imports (66 per cent), followed by Germany (33 per cent) and Italy (1.0 per cent). Israel was the 15th largest arms importer globally in 2020–24, down from 14th in 2015–19. ‘Israel has received substantial military aid from the USA following the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023,’ said Zain Hussain. ‘However, for its recent military operations, Israel has employed mainly US-supplied weapons it had received earlier. Israel’s adversaries Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis have relied on Iranian arms, and Hezbollah and the Houthis have used Iranian-supplied missiles and drones against Israel.’ Insecurity and conflict drive large increase in arms imports to West Africa Arms transfers to West Africa have been rising sharply in the past 15 years as the security situation has deteriorated. The combined arms imports of West African states almost doubled (+82 per cent) between 2010–14 and 2020–24. Nigeria accounted for by far the biggest share (34 per cent) of arms imports to West Africa in 2020–24. ‘The growth in arms imports to West Africa has been striking. While the volume of imports remains relatively small, it has important geopolitical implications,’ said Katarina Djokic, Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘States like Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal seem to be rapidly increasing their imports. Arms suppliers are using arms exports to boost their influence in this part of the world, including emerging suppliers—primarily Türkiye—alongside more established actors such as China, France, Russia and the USA.’ Other notable developments African arms imports fell by 44 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. This was mainly due to large decreases in imports by Algeria (–73 per cent) and Morocco (–26 per cent). Arms imports by states in sub-Saharan Africa increased by 4.2 per cent. Combat aircraft are the main long-range strike weapon imported by states, but interest in long-range land-attack missiles is increasing. In 2020–24 the USA supplied 45 per cent of global long-range land-attack missile exports, delivering them to 7 states, with deliveries to 13 states pending. Arms imports by states in the Americas increased by 13 per cent. The USA was the biggest importer in the region (accounting for 3.1 per cent of global arms imports and 50 per cent of imports by states in the Americas). Brazil’s arms imports increased by 77 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and accounted for 49 per cent of all arms imports to South America in 2020–24. The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent). North Korea exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. With this, both states violated the United Nations sanctions on North Korea.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlBG2QUsGO5nU	2025-03-11T17:42:06-07:00	
Ukraine World’s Biggest Arms Importer: US’ Dominance Of Global Ar...	Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but Russia (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind France (9.6 per cent), while Italy (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period. ‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘However, some major arms importers, including Saudi Arabia, India and China, saw large declines in import volumes for a variety of reasons, despite high threat perceptions in their regions.’ European NATO members increase dependence on US-supplied arms Arms imports by the European NATO members more than doubled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+105 per cent). The USA supplied 64 per cent of these arms, a substantially larger share than in 2015–19 (52 per cent). The other main suppliers were France and South Korea (accounting for 6.5 per cent each), Germany (4.7 per cent) and Israel (3.9 per cent). ‘With an increasingly belligerent Russia and transatlantic relations under stress during the first Trump presidency, European NATO states have taken steps to reduce their dependence on arms imports and to strengthen the European arms industry,’ said Pieter Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘But the transatlantic arms-supply relationship has deep roots. Imports from the USA have risen and European NATO states have almost 500 combat aircraft and many other weapons still on order from the USA.’ USA further increases its share of arms exports, while Russian exports slide Arms exports by the USA increased by 21 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and its share of global arms exports grew from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. The USA supplied major arms to 107 states in 2020–24. For the first time in two decades, the largest share of US arms exports in 2020–24 went to Europe (35 per cent) rather than the Middle East (33 per cent). Nevertheless, the top single recipient of US arms was Saudi Arabia (12 per cent of US arms exports). ‘The USA is in a unique position when it comes to arms exports. At 43 per cent, its share of global arms exports is more than four times as much as the next-largest exporter, France,’ said Mathew George. ‘The USA continues to be the supplier of choice for advanced long-range strike capabilities like combat aircraft.’ In contrast to the USA, arms exports by Russia fell sharply (–64 per cent) between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. ‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. ‘Two of Russia’s most important arms-trading relationships had already weakened before 2022, with India increasingly favouring other suppliers, and China sourcing more arms from its own burgeoning arms industry.’ Russia delivered major arms to 33 states in 2020–24. Two thirds of Russian arms exports went to three states: India (38 per cent), China (17 per cent) and Kazakhstan (11 per cent). France became the world’s second largest arms supplier in 2020–24, delivering arms to 65 states. France’s exports of major arms to other European states almost trebled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+187 per cent). This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The second largest recipient of major arms from France was Qatar (9.7 per cent of French arms exports). China was the fourth largest exporter of arms in 2020–24, with 5.9 per cent of global arms exports. Despite China’s efforts to increase its arms exports, many large importers do not buy Chinese arms for political reasons. Asia and Oceania remains largest arms-importing region; China’s imports more than halve The share of global arms transfers going to states in Asia and Oceania fell from 41 per cent to 33 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. A 21 per cent drop in imports to the region was in large part due to arms imports by China shrinking by 64 per cent between the two periods, as it increasingly substituted imports—mainly from Russia—with locally designed and produced weapon systems. China’s arms imports are likely to keep falling as the capacity of its domestic arms industry grows. Four states in Asia and Oceania ranked among the 10 largest arms importers globally in 2020–24: India, Pakistan, Japan and Australia. China dropped out of the top 10 arms importers for the first time since 1990–94. The main suppliers to the region in 2020–24 were the USA, which accounted for 37 per cent of regional arms imports, Russia (17 per cent) and China (14 per cent). India was the world’s second largest arms importer, with its imports reflecting perceived threats from both China and Pakistan. However, its imports decreased by 9.3 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The largest share of Indian arms imports (36 per cent) came from Russia, a significantly smaller share than in 2015–19 (55 per cent) and 2010–14 (72 per cent). Arms imports by Pakistan grew by 61 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. China became even more dominant as its supplier, accounting for 81 per cent of Pakistan’s arms imports in 2020–24, compared with 74 per cent in 2015–19. With the sharp drop in China’s arms imports, and marked decreases in imports by Taiwan (–27 per cent) and South Korea (–24 per cent), arms imports by East Asian states shrank by 22 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. Japan (+93 per cent) was the only East Asian state that saw an increase in its arms imports. ‘While arms imports to Europe and the Middle East continue to grab media attention, Asia and Oceania remained the largest arms-importing region in the world in 2020–24, as it has been almost invariably since the early 1990s,’ said Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Threat perceptions concerning China are behind much of the arms procurement in the region.’ Middle East arms imports dip Arms imports by states in the Middle East fell by 20 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24.

Qatar was the world’s third largest arms importer in 2020–24 (up from 10th largest in 2015–19). Between 2015–19 and 2020–24, Saudi Arabia’s arms imports decreased by 41 per cent. More than half of arms imports to the Middle East came from the USA (52 per cent), while 13 per cent came from Italy, 9.8 per cent from France and 7.6 per cent from Germany. ‘Regional conflicts and tensions continue to drive demand for arms imports in the Middle East,’ said Zain Hussain, Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Given the volume of pending deliveries, the Middle East will remain a major arms-importing region.’ Despite the ongoing war in Gaza, arms imports by Israel remained largely stable between 2015–19 and 2020–24.

Brazil’s arms imports increased by 77 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and accounted for 49 per cent of all arms imports to South America in 2020–24. The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent). North Korea exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. With this, both states violated the United Nations sanctions on North Korea.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcyPosbFQglPIBbbVNaE-u	2025-03-11T17:42:06-07:00	
Ukraine Agrees To US-Brokered Cease-Fire Deal, Unlocking Military...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day cease-fire in the war against the Russian invasion, prompting the United States to say it would immediately lift the suspension of military aid, including the sharing of intelligence. The outcome of nine hours of talks on March 11 in Jeddah marked a stunning turnaround less than two weeks after an acrimonious meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The clash between the two leaders preceded the US pause in aid and limits on intelligence sharing, which the United States said were imposed because of doubts that Ukraine was committed to seeking peace. 'The President wanted this war to end yesterday... So our hope is that the Russians will answer 'yes' as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after the agreement was announced. A joint statement issued by the two countries said Ukraine expressed a 'readiness' to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire, 'which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation.' Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a meeting with Russia would take place later on March 11 or the following day. Rubio, who attended the talks in Saudi Arabia along with national-security adviser Mike Waltz, said the cease-fire plan puts the ball in Russia’s court. 'We’re going to tell them this is what’s on the table,' he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government. 'Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it’ll be up to them to say yes or no.' Russian officials have repeatedly said that they want a comprehensive peace deal, not a cease-fire or other temporary arrangement. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it wouldn't rule out contacts with US officials over next several days, but gave no further comment. The US and Ukrainian delegations said they also discussed the importance of humanitarian relief efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the cease-fire, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. 'I have confirmation that the security assistance from the United States has been restored,' Pavlo Palisa, deputy head of the Ukrainian President's Office and a member of the delegation, said in a post on Facebook. 'Arrangements are starting to be fulfilled.' In addition, Ukraine and the United States agreed to conclude a pact on joint development of Ukrainian critical minerals and other resources as soon as possible. That deal had been expected to be signed at the White House meeting on February 28, but Zelenskyy left early after the argument in the Oval Office, leaving it in limbo. The talks were closely watched across Europe, which has grown concerned Washington's renewed contacts with the Kremlin would sideline both Kyiv and Brussels from the peace process. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who recently traveled to the White House to meet Trump, congratulated the US and Ukrainian delegations, saying it is now up to Moscow to end the fighting. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the proposal for a ceasefire agreement and the resumption of U.S. intelligence sharing and security assistance was a welcome development.'This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine. The ball is now in Russia’s court,' she added. The talks in Jeddah on March 11 followed a large-scale Ukrainian drone attack that struck the Moscow region and other Russian provinces overnight, killing three people. John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said before the joint statement that restoring intelligence cooperation should be seen as a positive result for Kyiv. He also said sequencing in future negotiations will be crucial. While an early cease-fire can be key part of a future peace process, he stresses that it's important that it be followed by further steps toward a lasting peace deal, such as continued military shipments to Ukraine, a potential demilitarized zone, and a greater role for European countries, including their forces deployed as peacekeepers. 'These are all serious ideas that have been floated,' Herbst said. 'That might not be a just peace, because a just peace wouldn’t see Ukraine have to concede territory, but it could still be a durable one that makes it very hard for Russia to renew aggression.' What Role Will Russia And Europe Play In Peace Talks? As Ukrainian and US officials met in Saudi Arabia, attention was also shifting to the other two players that will decide how the war ends: Russia and Kyiv’s European allies. Top military officials from more than 30 nations met in Paris on March 11 for talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine. The force is being envisaged by Britain and France. Its aim is to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any cease-fire. The force might include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine’s defense. Russia has so far said it is against accepting European troops in Ukraine as part of a deal. The Kremlin has also spoken about getting Western sanctions lifted on its economy as part of a peace process, including in Saudi Arabia where US and Russian officials held talks nearly a month ago. Marie Dumoulin, a former French diplomat and an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, says that this gives European governments some leverage when the dust settles from the talks in Jeddah. She said that doubts remain in European capitals about whether Russia is willing to make any concessions of its own and that Europe can use both its own offer of security guarantees to Ukraine and the possibility of lifting European Union sanctions on Russia as a way to shape discussions in both Moscow and Washington. 'This gives Ukraine a few more cards to hold at the table,' Dumoulin told RFE/RL. 'These can give Ukraine some room to say whether the deal being offered to them is good enough yet or not.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlIHs3l1_N3P3	2025-03-11T17:40:33-07:00

What Was It Like for Our Sapiens Ancestors To Meet And Mix With C...	Between 50,000 and 35,000 years ago in Eurasia, the disappearance of hominin species or their biocultural assimilation with anatomically modern humans is one of the biggest questions in prehistory today. Until now, at least 14 different species have been assigned to the genus Homo since it emerged in Ethiopia some 2.8 million years ago revealing branching evolutionary stories of survival, intermixing, and extinctions. Archaeology is increasingly allowing us to glimpse into one of those epochs, from 50,000 to 35,000 years ago—the period of transition between the Middle and the Upper Paleolithic eras when modern humans emerged as the last representative of our genus on the planet. In 2017, new finds from the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco were published, indicating that our species—H. sapiens—appeared on the scene as early as 300,000 years ago. Spreading into Eurasia l00,000 years later, these early anatomically modern humans rubbed shoulders with Neandertals and Denisovans, and may also have had encounters with five other distinct hominin populations that have only very recently been identified, including H. floresiensis, H. luzonensis, H. longi, and H. juluensis in Asia and Nesher Ramla Homo in the Levant. Given what we know from historical events that chronicle human population exchanges through time, many archeologists question whether the 'disappearances' of these other human lineages might have had anything to do with their coming into contact with modern humans. Taking an example of human interactions that took place more than half a millennium ago helps us to understand how these interactions can deeply impact the human condition on multiple levels, many of which would be incomprehensible in the prehistoric archeological record without written documents. The people of Western Europe living in hierarchized social configurations had reached a stage of technological readiness that led them to innovate ways to sustain life over extended periods of seafaring. As a result, they came into contact with the great civilizations established in the precolonial Americas over hundreds of generations. Before this encounter, the millions of people who lived in the Americas were oblivious to the existence of Europeans who would build powerful empires on the ruins of their treasured territorial and cultural heritage. The consequences of the ensuing exchanges were both cataclysmic and transformative. Notwithstanding their immeasurable human impact, this contact altered the course of animal demography and deeply affected the global distribution of countless species of plants and trees that the colonizing populations freely displaced and exploited to enrich their own countries. Against the backdrop of this extraordinary scenario was the unprecedented spread of bacterial, viral, and fungal assemblages that indelibly modified evolutionary systems established over millennia—decimating an estimated 90 percent of Indigenous populations in their wake soon after the consolidation of colonization. While it is difficult for us to conceive the magnitude of global turbulence generated after this event, we know that it led to a new world order that used human slavery to build systems of unidirectional wealth distribution whose ramifications still resound today. Written records provide information about this period of global turmoil that help us to build our understanding of complex events that occurred in the past. Thirty thousand years from now, how will the multilevel repercussions of this period of human history be reflected in the archeological record? Unlike the chaotic shifts that rocked the world at the cusp of the European Renaissance, archeologists studying the remote past cannot rely on written accounts of how ancient population interactions played out. In retrospect, it should be pointed out that the decimation of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas involved exchanges among a single human species, whereas the transition from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic involved human forms with distinct or even mosaic genetic, anatomic and sociocultural traits, with only one species remaining by around 35,000 years ago. In conformity with the doctrines of their time, Europeans justified their actions by evoking cultural and racial differences that they believed made them superior to the populations they subjugated, while uneven levels of technological hegemony allowed them to consolidate domination. Scientific results emanating from ancient genomics are shedding light on these paleo-interactions and painting a new picture of how humanity evolved, migrated, adapted, and reproduced during this key period of prehistory. Each individual's genetic code is transcribed in the sequence of the base pairs composing the double-stranded helix of the DNA moleculecarrying biological information passed on by reproduction. Discrete sections of a DNA strand are composed of the genes that define phenotypic (observable) and genotypic (hidden) traits defining a population. Throughout the world today, the human genetic code differs between individuals by only around 0.1 percent. Under the right conditions, genetic data retrieved from ancient human fossils can be a powerful tool to study similarities and differences separating human lineages and is complementary to classical paleontological methods like Linnaean taxonomy and morphometric determination. Recent reconstructions of the genomic histories of fossil H. sapiens, Neandertals, and the Denisovans confirm not only that interspecific breeding took place but also that it produced fertile offspring, suggesting biological mixing played a role in the outcome of the modern human condition. Having successfully occupied a huge territorial range stretching from the Levant to Western Europe and northward into Siberia for thousands of generations, our cousin species H. neanderthalensis is at the center of the enigma. The paleo-genetic data obtained from Neandertal fossils indicates a complex scenario with physical encounters taking place with modern humans between 65,000 and 47,000 years ago. Meanwhile, a Neandertal genetic inheritance of between 1 and 4 percent has been documented in present-day non-African populations, and gene flow from early modern humans to some Neandertals also took place as early as 100,000 years ago. Analyzing genetic records from early modern humans living in Siberia and Central Europe 45,000-35,000 years ago revealed comparatively higher and relatively recent admixtures of Neandertal DNA, with these individuals believed to have contributed little to the gene pool of later European populations. In some cases, fossil human remains and their genomic signatures have even been found to display a mosaic of archaic and derived features, leading some paleoanthropologists to consider the possibility that Neandertals did not 'disappear,' but rather, they were assimilated into a modern human clade developing in Eurasia at the time. This raises the possibility of an ancestral population of anatomically modern humans that migrated out of Africa and subsequently underwent speciation as they spread into the ecologically diverse regions of Eurasia, where they evolved locally into diverse groups that occasionally interbred with one another, producing fertile offspring. From the Darwinian viewpoint, the decrease in Neandertal DNA genetic sequences shows that they were not selected in the natural evolutionary process that gave way to modern humans. To explore this puzzling scenario, some archeologists turn to the cultural record left behind by these ancient human groups. Specific methods applied to study human-made artifacts are used to link them to predefined stages of techno-social evolution traditionally equated with distinct cultural complexes. Since the early 20th century, prehistorians have ascribed these cultural entities to different types of humans. But the apparent inter-specific mixing evidenced by the genetic data and the emergence of H. sapiens far earlier than previously thought have contributed to changing this traditional human-culture equation. Once conveyed as brutish and primitive, Neandertals were alleged to have been incapable of matching the relatively 'advanced' esthetic and technological capacities of their modern human counterparts. But this premise has also changed with new data demonstrating that Neandertals lived in socially advanced groups, that they appear to have practiced some form of art and body ornamentation, and that they intentionally buried their dead, suggesting powerful symbolic and even ritual practices. So what do the artifacts tell us about the transitional period that saw the replacement of H. neanderthalensis by H. sapiens? A number of archeological sites preserve a record of this transitional phase, with Middle Paleolithic layers yielding the so-called Mousterian artifacts made from prepared stone cores attributed to Neandertals, overlain by strata containing Upper Paleolithic stone blades or bladelets attributed to H. sapiens. The blade industries attributed to modern humans are also associated with finely crafted bone, ivory, and antler artifacts, shell beads, ochre, and diverse forms of figurative art. Using detailed technological and typological criteria, archeologists further subdivide these cultural complexes, refining the cultural groupings to reconstruct a chrono-cultural framework reflecting human population turnover in time and space. Because only one species of Homo lived during the Upper Paleolithic (after around 35,000 years ago), changes observed in the tool kits are thought to reflect different traditions, rather than different hominins. These shifts are attributed to multiple factors, including cultural transmission through inter-populational contact. However, since multiple species of Homo were present during the Middle Paleolithic, cultural change is often thought to signal the disappearance of one lineage and its replacement by another. This begs the question: Do we observe a gradual or an abrupt transition from one phase to the next? If modern humans and Neandertals were interbreeding, then we might assume that they could also have exchanged cultural and technological know-how. This means that we might anticipate finding some blending of cultural evidence, just as we might expect to find hominin fossils with intermediate anatomical traits. Still, in most cases, the different cultural complexes defined for the Upper Paleolithic—generally beginning with the Early or Proto-Aurignacian cultures—appear sequentially above the Middle Paleolithic deposits, without intermixing of technological, typological, or stylistic features. Paradoxically, what we now know to have been a long period of contact between Neandertals and modern humans is not clearly reflected in the cultural materials found in the archeological record. But there are some intriguing exceptions. In Western and Central Europe, the Near East, and Siberia, where these intra-specific exchanges are being validated by paleo-genomics and comparative anatomy in several archeological sites, the 'intermediary' cultural scenarios are also becoming clearer. In some cases, transitional assemblages with elements inherited from the Middle Paleolithic combine with tools conveying innovative features commonly attributed to the Upper Paleolithic. For now, there is little consensus about which hominin was responsible for making these 'transitional' took kits in the timeframe that witnessed the disappearance or assimilation of the Neandertals and resulted in the ultimate domination of H. sapiens. Further research is needed to clarify humanity's complex evolutionary history that—in the 3 million years since the emergence of Homo—has only been condensed into a single representative species since around 35,000 years ago. When we compare this prehistoric chronicle to a transformative historical event for which we have a rich body of written information, we can see how huge revolutions can take place swiftly, almost imperceptibly, on the geological time scale. As archeologists discover more about the transitions in time that led us to where we are today, the subtleties of the complex biocultural mixing nascent to the contemporary globalization of our species are being revealed.

What Was It Like for Our Sapiens Ancestors To Meet And Mix With C...	Between 50,000 and 35,000 years ago in Eurasia, the disappearance of hominin species or their biocultural assimilation with anatomically modern humans is one of the biggest questions in prehistory today. Until now, at least 14 different species have been assigned to the genus Homo since it emerged in Ethiopia some 2.8 million years ago revealing branching evolutionary stories of survival, intermixing, and extinctions. Archaeology is increasingly allowing us to glimpse into one of those epochs, from 50,000 to 35,000 years ago—the period of transition between the Middle and the Upper Paleolithic eras when modern humans emerged as the last representative of our genus on the planet. In 2017, new finds from the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco were published, indicating that our species—H. sapiens—appeared on the scene as early as 300,000 years ago. Spreading into Eurasia l00,000 years later, these early anatomically modern humans rubbed shoulders with Neandertals and Denisovans, and may also have had encounters with five other distinct hominin populations that have only very recently been identified, including H. floresiensis, H. luzonensis, H. longi, and H. juluensis in Asia and Nesher Ramla Homo in the Levant. Given what we know from historical events that chronicle human population exchanges through time, many archeologists question whether the 'disappearances' of these other human lineages might have had anything to do with their coming into contact with modern humans. Taking an example of human interactions that took place more than half a millennium ago helps us to understand how these interactions can deeply impact the human condition on multiple levels, many of which would be incomprehensible in the prehistoric archeological record without written documents. The people of Western Europe living in hierarchized social configurations had reached a stage of technological readiness that led them to innovate ways to sustain life over extended periods of seafaring. As a result, they came into contact with the great civilizations established in the precolonial Americas over hundreds of generations. Before this encounter, the millions of people who lived in the Americas were oblivious to the existence of Europeans who would build powerful empires on the ruins of their treasured territorial and cultural heritage. The consequences of the ensuing exchanges were both cataclysmic and transformative. Notwithstanding their immeasurable human impact, this contact altered the course of animal demography and deeply affected the global distribution of countless species of plants and trees that the colonizing populations freely displaced and exploited to enrich their own countries. Against the backdrop of this extraordinary scenario was the unprecedented spread of bacterial, viral, and fungal assemblages that indelibly modified evolutionary systems established over millennia—decimating an estimated 90 percent of Indigenous populations in their wake soon after the consolidation of colonization. While it is difficult for us to conceive the magnitude of global turbulence generated after this event, we know that it led to a new world order that used human slavery to build systems of unidirectional wealth distribution whose ramifications still resound today. Written records provide information about this period of global turmoil that help us to build our understanding of complex events that occurred in the past. Thirty thousand years from now, how will the multilevel repercussions of this period of human history be reflected in the archeological record? Unlike the chaotic shifts that rocked the world at the cusp of the European Renaissance, archeologists studying the remote past cannot rely on written accounts of how ancient population interactions played out. In retrospect, it should be pointed out that the decimation of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas involved exchanges among a single human species, whereas the transition from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic involved human forms with distinct or even mosaic genetic, anatomic and sociocultural traits, with only one species remaining by around 35,000 years ago.

Remember Kerensky: The Failure of Reformist Regimes – OpEd	The Trump administration assumed power in the thick of public fury, following five years of brutal despotism, economic decline, and many years, if not decades, of declining trust. The intensity of the public mood is rarely reported by legacy media without condemnation. The denials of regime failure by the entire establishment in every sector has only caused incredulity to grow and spread. No matter how much you think people are angry, you are likely underestimating the level of public disgust with the regime, not just in the US but all over the industrialized world. In 2024, it reached such a fevered pitch that the seemingly impossible happened with the election of a former president who had been subject to nonstop media demonization, lawfare without precedent, and even assassination attempts. The attacks only helped him. Trump’s party was swept into power. That includes control of a Congress with many members who seem to be unaware of the urgency of the moment. Under such conditions, this cannot be the end of the story. There is a long history of reformist governments failing to act fast enough to quell public demand for change. It is typical that such governments underestimate the fire behind the historical forces at work. They come to believe that the problem is fixed by a personnel change, whereas the real issue is systemic and comprehensive. The classic case is Russia, 1917. The government of Alexander Kerensky (1881-1970) ruled Russia for only eight months, following the toppling of the Romanov monarchy and before the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. It was supposed to be an agent of calm reform; it ended as a parenthesis between the old regime and the new. Kerensky was a lawyer, a reformer, and a non-communist supporter of labor-led social democracy. Active in anti-government protests and denunciations for years, Kerensky seemed like the right man for the job. He had one foot in the old world and one in the new. On taking power, he found himself in the position of making judgments about the pace and path of reform efforts. He had to deal with a collapsing economy, revolutionary fervor among the workers and peasants, and grave suspicion toward the whole of the ruling classes, the military in particular. He proclaimed Russia to be a Republic of the Western variety and had every intention of holding elections and shepherding into being a new type of ruling regime in Russia. The war would end, land would go to the peasants, inflation would stop, and people would find their voice in government. Just not yet. It had to be orderly, in Kerensky’s view. His mistake was in thinking that he was in charge of the motion of history. He made a fateful judgment in thinking it was all about him and not the movement that gave rise to his position. He decided to continue the war and make one final push for victory. That included an intensification of conscription in the midst of inflation. That decision ended in disaster. What was he thinking? In his view, Russia had already sacrificed so much for the war effort. His plan was to make good on these sacrifices by granting the Russian people the pride of victory. He had hoped to tap into the magically forgiving power of patriotism, never more enlivened than by triumph in war. His gamble did not work out. His more fundamental error was in believing that his rule was more secure than it was. One can see why. The Russian state had a very long history of compelling assent. With church and state united, the public had a long history of acquiescence. He had not realized fully that the bond with the people broke when the Czar was unseated. Kerensky could not imagine the level of public doubt surrounding his position. He was brutal enough to draft people to get killed and maimed in war but lacked the military prowess and loyalty to enforce his new role. Plus, his stated role was to be provisional and bring about elections. That presented to the public a message of vulnerability. Meanwhile, in his own thinking, he was overly deferential to the financial and influence networks of the past. He wanted them on board with the next phase of Russian history, which he would lead. He underestimated the massive gap in perceptions that separated the ruling class and the people on the ground. He tried but failed to heal the chasm. The October Revolution seems inevitable in retrospect, but it was not. Had Kerensky acted quickly to dismantle the machinery of power, immediately withdraw the troops, unplug the money printers, and slash the spending and bureaucracy, his reformist efforts might have led to orderly elections and the normalization of society. Maybe. Instead, Russia experienced a revolution that began with great joy at home and abroad and quickly turned murderous as the entire royal family was slaughtered, the government turned on dissidents, the economy fully collapsed, and a regime far more ferocious than the one it replaced grabbed power and held it for 70 years. Kerensky’s failure to move quickly doomed his country to ruin for all but the last ten years of a full century. This is due to a single miscalculation: underestimating the public’s demand for dramatic change. He and his reformist cronies believed they could make the shift from the center, satisfying critics on all sides with slow-go moves and deference to the status quo. It is only obvious in retrospect that this plan was completely unworkable. It is typical for reformist governments to get carried away congratulating themselves for displacing their hated predecessors. They also tend to overestimate the extent of their hold on power. They are squeezed from two directions: legacy institutional corruption, which hates the intrusion of earnest newcomers, and a public deeply impatient for overthrowing evil. Navigating this maze of influence and pressure is not easy, obviously, but the error is usually the same: too much deference to the existing order and not enough push to accommodate public demands. Trump has his cabinet, which is earnest and includes top leaders of the dissident faction. He has DOGE and Elon Musk, who is said to be powerful due to his net worth, but maybe not. Trump has loyalists around him. He has the confidence of his movement and an aura of personal heroism in overcoming every attempt to defeat him. Trump’s political party has the Congress. But this Congress shows no signs of understanding the seriousness of the moment. Their budgets read as if nothing is going on, that there is no real need for drastic action. Even the foreign aid that Trump has tried to end is fully funded with a budget that adds more trillions to the debt. The larger problem is the machinery that undid his last tenure as president. The Trump administration, even if it is moving as fast and furiously as it is able, constitutes a small faction within a much larger apparatus, including hundreds of agencies, millions of employees, millions more in contractors, and unfathomable webs of finance and influence into every sector of life at home and abroad. It is not possible to describe the fullness of the opposition to change. On the fifth anniversary of lockdowns, X (formerly Twitter) has been subjected to DDOS attacks that took down a platform that was built to be impenetrable. The culprits are unknown. But those with an interest in stopping reform are known: they are the people powerful enough to have shut down the world five years ago. They want no upheaval and will use every resource to prevent it. The Trump administration came to power swearing to take on all of this, beginning with finally bringing some light on the financial books long held in secrecy. It had early successes with an avalanche of executive orders that deleted the most hated features of life under the regime. A month and weeks in, there has been a noticeable slowing of momentum with priority given to cabinet confirmations, budget battles, and trade concerns, which might turn out to be the obsession that distracts from myriad immediate needs. The hold that Trump has on government is more fragile than it looks from the outside. This might be the first administration in a century that has fully understood the problem of the administrative state and has had the determination to do something about it. Most other presidential administrations have either approved of the status quo, pretended not to notice that they are not in charge, or otherwise lacked the driving motivation and mandate to gut it. So too, the Kerensky government faced pressure in two directions: from the establishment that wanted the status quo and the people who wanted revolution. He chose a middle ground. Eight months later, he was gone and replaced by a new ruling junta that made the Romanovs look liberal by comparison. This is justified worry today: Can the reformist government in the US move hard and fast enough to please the fury at the grassroots? Can it stay focused enough to achieve the aim, overcoming myriad obstacles? Or will it go the way of previous post-despotic reformers and become a parenthesis in history, with every earnest aim foiled by a powerful establishment it failed to overthrow?

Most other presidential administrations have either approved of the status quo, pretended not to notice that they are not in charge, or otherwise lacked the driving motivation and mandate to gut it. So too, the Kerensky government faced pressure in two directions: from the establishment that wanted the status quo and the people who wanted revolution. He chose a middle ground. Eight months later, he was gone and replaced by a new ruling junta that made the Romanovs look liberal by comparison. This is justified worry today: Can the reformist government in the US move hard and fast enough to please the fury at the grassroots? Can it stay focused enough to achieve the aim, overcoming myriad obstacles? Or will it go the way of previous post-despotic reformers and become a parenthesis in history, with every earnest aim foiled by a powerful establishment it failed to overthrow?

Europe Faces A MAGA ‘Vibe-Shift’ As Trump Moves To His Primordial...	President Trump wants Ukraine settled, full stop. This is so that he can move ahead quickly – to normalise with Russia, and begin the ‘big picture’ project of setting a new World Order, one that will end wars and facilitate business ties. The point here – which Europe feigns to not understand – is that the end to the Ukraine conflict simply is Trump’s ‘gateway’ to the entire rationale and platform on which he stood: The Great Reset of the Geo-Political landscape. Ukraine, simply said, is the obstacle to Trump’s pursuit of his primordial objective: The Global Reset. Starmer, Macron and the eastern wing of the Euro-élites are blind to the sheer scale of the global vibe-shift towards traditionalist U.S. politics and ethics. They miss too, the barely concealed fury in the Trump world that exists behind this nascent revolution. 'The Maga Right has none of the inhibitions of its predecessors. It is planning to leverage the power of a recaptured state to annihilate its enemies', Allister Heath writes. The European Ruling Class is in desperate trouble and increasingly isolated, in a world shifting ‘Rightward’ at breakneck speed. 'The U.S. is now the enemy of the West', the FT proclaims. European leaders wantonly won’t understand. The reality is that the U.S. is engaged now in rolling up Europe’s foreign policy. And, is about to start exporting U.S. traditional Republican values to roll up the European wokeist belief-system. The European Ruling strata – far removed from its base – has failed to grasp the threat to its own interests (a scenario outlined here). The Trump administration is trying to rebuild the ailing Republic, and Americans in this new era do not care for the European obsession with ancient feuds and their entailing wars. Trump reportedly views with utter disdain the UK and European boast that should the U.S. not do it, then Europe will. The Brussels class claims to be able still – after three years of losing in Ukraine – to be able to inflict a humiliating defeat on President Putin. More profoundly, however, Team Trump – committed to the task of taking down the American Deep State as the ‘inexorable enemy’ – perceives (rightly) the British security state to be co-joined at the hip with their American counterparts, as a part of its global meta-structure. And its oldest and deepest component has always been the destruction of Russia, and its dismemberment. So when Macron, in an address to the nation this week, rejected a ceasefire in Ukraine and declared that 'peace in Europe is only possible with a weakened Russia', calling the country a direct threat to France and the continent, many in ‘Trump world’ will interpret this defiant declaration (that ‘Ukraine defeating Russia is preferable to ‘peace’’) is nothing more than Macron and Starmer ventriloquising the aims of the Meta Deep State. This notion is lent substance by the sudden plethora of articles appearing in the European-(managed) MSM to the effect that Russia’s economy is much weaker than it appears and might collapse in the next year. Of course it is nonsense. This is about managing the European public to believe that keeping the war going in Ukraine is a ‘good idea’. The absurdity of the European position was perhaps best captured, as Wolfgang Münchau notes, in its full hubris last year by the historian and writer Anne Applebaum when she won a prestigious German peace prize. During her acceptance speech, she maintained that victory was more important than peace, asserting that the West’s ultimate goal should be regime change in Russia: 'We must help Ukrainians achieve victory, and not only for the sake of Ukraine,' she said. Zelensky and his European fans want ‘to negotiate’ – though later, rather than sooner (perhaps in a year, as one European Foreign Minister reportedly told Marco Rubio privately). 'This', Münchau writes, 'is what the very public disagreement in the Oval Office [last week] was all about. Peace through untrammelled victory — essentially the Second World War model — as the lens through which virtually all European leaders, and most commentators view the Russia-Ukraine conflict'. America sees things differently: It views almost certainly the European Deep State to be putting a spoke into Trump’s ‘normalisation with Russia’ wheel – a normalisation to which they are viscerally opposed. Or, at the very least, as the Europeans chasing a 'mirage that no longer exists, stubbornly hiking ‘tax and spend’, whilst doubling down on mass immigration and overpriced energy, oblivious to the flashing red lights in the [financial markets] as government debt yields rocket to their highest levels since 1998', as Allister Heath outlines. In other words, the suggestion is that Friedrich Merz, Macron and Starmer are talking about how they are going to turn around their countries – via a massive infusion of debt – into defence superstates. Yet, at some level of consciousness, they must realise that it is not doable, so they settle instead for presenting themselves as ‘world leaders on the international stage’. The European élites are deeply unstable ‘leaders’ who are risking the prosperity and stability of the continent. It is clear these countries do not have the military capacity to intervene in any concerted manner. More than anything, it is the European economy circling the drain that is the reality at the gates. Zelensky is accomplice to the European insistence that defeating Russia takes priority over achieving peace in Ukraine, in spite of lacking any strategic rationale as to how it may be achieved after three years of a worsening military situation. Both plans – crushing the Russian economy with sanctions and attrition of the Russian military to the point of collapse – have failed. Why then does Zelensky resist Trump’s peace proposals? On the surface, it makes no sense. The explanation likely goes back to the post-Maidan era when the western ‘Meta Security State’ (principally, the British and the Americans) entrenched hardline Banderites (then a tiny minority) into the Ukrainian Police, Intelligence and Security State. They are still today the controlling force. Even were this faction to acknowledge that their war cannot be won, they understand what happens if they lose: Russia will not deal with them. They view them as extremists (if not war criminals) who are in no way ‘agreement capable’ and must be replaced by a leadership who is actually capable of compromise. Russia would likely pursue and bring these men to trial. Zelensky has to be frightened at what the Banderites might do to him (despite his British team of bodyguards). Well, Trump is not entertaining these European ‘games’: He is administering a slap-down to Zelensky and European leaders, perhaps bringing Zelensky into line; or perhaps not … Team Trump, Politico reports, has now entered into direct talks with the Ukrainian opposition on holding early elections to unseat Zelensky – who is on his way to being removed, members of Team Trump say. Zelensky may be finished, but interestingly Zaluzhniy wasn’t discussed either. He is being groomed by the British as a replacement – it looks like the Americans are going to make this decision independently of the British, too. President Trump has ordered intelligence sharing with Ukraine stopped. What he technically did was to stop allowing Ukraine to use exclusive U.S. targeting systems controlled by U.S. Intelligence, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office and the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. What has been suspended is the exchange of so-called ‘lethal’ data, including information for HIMARS targeting. However, the defensive information needed for protection is still being provided to Ukraine. 'The extent of the intelligence-sharing freeze, which appears to have been imposed alongside the halt in military aid Mr Trump announced on Monday, initially appeared to be somewhat limited … But by Wednesday afternoon it became clear that the Trump administration, ignoring overtures from Mr Zelensky the previous evening, had gone much further. A military intelligence officer in Kyiv told The Telegraph that the freeze amounted to 'more or less a total blackout''. Put bluntly, the earlier munitions freeze will undoubtedly affect Ukraine’s military abilities over time, however the impact might not be felt for some weeks. The loss of vital intelligence, however, will make its mark immediately. It will – simply put – blind Ukraine. In Ukrainian command posts, the battle tracking and satellite online feeds on tablets and TV screens have indeed been disconnected. What Trump’s slap-down has done is to puncture the fiction that Ukraine is able to defend itself with a little substitute of European support. That has always been nonsensical bravado. NATO, the CIA and the global Intelligence Community have been in control of the war fighting from the outset. And that, for now, has been switched off. So, Europe wants to shoulder the U.S. burden? Bloomberg reports that European bond markets are in meltdown. If Europe pretends to replace the U.S., it is going to be extremely expensive, very politically costly, and it will fail.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlPZTyabhfd6j	2025-03-11T17:32:48-07:00

Spending Cuts Won’t Weaken The US Economy: They Will Strengthen I...	By Daniel Lacalle The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model projection for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2025) is now showing a slump to -1.5 percent. This marks a significant downward revision from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent on February 19, 2025. Such an enormous decline is strange. How did we go from +2.3 percent to -1.5 percent in less than a month? That kind of collapse in an economy as large as the United States is exceedingly rare. The immediate reaction from the media is to call this the beginning of a 'Trump recession' and blame it on President Trump’s policies. Interestingly, on June 1, 2022, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimated the second quarter of 2022 growth at +1.3 percent. By July 1, 2022, it had dropped to -2.1 percent, a shift of 3.4 percentage points in 30 days. What did the media call it? 'Growth scare'. A similar thing happened in the third quarter of 2021. The estimate fell from 6.1 percent (July 30) to 2.3 percent (October 1), a 3.8-point drop over two months. In 2022, real GDP declined for two consecutive quarters under Biden’s administration. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the first quarter saw a decrease of -1.6 percent in the annualized rate, followed by a 0.6 percent drop in the second quarter. Hundreds of analysts, commentators, and economists, along with the NBER, swiftly declared that this was not a recession. Thus, it is hilarious to read the hundreds of comments arguing that the Atlanta Fed NowCast means that the new administration’s policies are causing a recession. As I wrote a few months ago, the United States has been in a private sector recession for months. However, an abnormal increase in government spending during a period of growth and a risky borrowing policy led to a bloated Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The United States had a $7.59 trillion nominal GDP increase between 2021 and 2024 compared to a rise of $8.47 trillion in government debt. This marks the worst GDP growth adjusted for government debt accumulation since the 1930s. Many analysts are warning that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts will cause a recession if government spending is aggressively reduced. However, cutting spending may 'reduce' GDP but does not harm productive economic growth; it will likely strengthen it. We must remember that US government spending financed by increasing federal debt accounted for about 22 percent to 25 percent of the total US GDP growth over 2021–2024. This extraordinary increase in government spending in the middle of a recovery led to record-high government debt and was the leading cause of money supply growth and, with it, the inflation burst that Americans are suffering today. A research study from MIT Sloan published on July 17, 2024, by Mark Kritzman et al., titled 'The Determinants of Inflation,' concluded that federal spending was the overwhelming driver of the inflation spike in 2022, estimating it was two to three times more significant than any other factors. Government spending was out of control, leading money supply growth to soar, and the cumulative inflation suffered by Americans in the past four years is over 20.9 percent, with groceries and gas prices rising by more than 40 percent. Excessive government spending was not only the cause of the rise in money supply growth and the burst of inflation but also led to an $8.47 trillion increase in debt and an unsustainable path to financial ruin if policies remained the same. According to the Congressional Budget Office, with no policy changes, the United States would have accumulated deficits of $12.6 trillion between 2025 and 2030. Net interest outlays were expected to grow from $881 billion in 2024 to $1.2 trillion by 2030, even assuming no recessions or unemployment increases. Cutting government spending is essential to reduce prices, bring inflation under control and stop the looming public finance disaster. By 2024, it became evident that revenue measures would not reduce the United States federal deficit. Deficits are always a spending problem. We must remember that 2024’s 2.8 percent GDP growth reflected almost $2 trillion in borrowing, a roughly one-to-one spending-to-growth ratio and a dangerous path to a debt crisis. Private GDP should measure the economy, as government spending and debt do not drive productive growth. Stripping government spending can give us a more accurate picture of the reality of the productive sector in America. The latest Atlanta Fed estimates show a massive decline in net exports (-3.7 percent) due to a large increase in imports, a small decline in consumption of goods (-0.09 percent) but strong services (+0.62 percent) and rises in government expenditure (+0.34 percent) and a healthy increase in investment (+0.62 percent). Thus, the surprising factor is an abnormal slump in exports and a rise in imports that may be revised, because the trade deficit in December 2024 rose to a record $98.4 billion and GDP did not reflect such a massive slump in net exports. The concerning thing is that government spending continues to be excessive, and the United States is running an annualized $2.5 trillion deficit. The United States will not enter a recession due to the change of administration, but because of the excess spending policies of the Biden years. Reducing federal spending, deficit, and debt accumulation is essential to recover the health of the economy. Bloating GDP with public spending and debt is not growing; it is the recipe for disaster.

What Should Republicans Do About Medicaid? – OpEd	Republicans are in a bind. In order to give substance to their new budget bill, they need to cut Medicaid spending by billions of dollars. Yet the White House and many congressional Republicans insist that they do not want to cut Medicaid benefits. Here is where DOGE can come to the rescue. In mainstream economics there is a technical definition of 'waste.' A system is wasteful if it is possible to make a change that can in principle make everyone better off. Fortunately, Medicaid is so inefficient that it provides us with a rich bundle of opportunities. We can make changes that vastly improve services for the beneficiaries and free up billions in savings for the tax bill—at the same time. Here are some examples. Paying market prices. When people are newly enrolled in Medicaid, their visits to the ER increase by 40 percent! A likely reason is that many doctors won’t see Medicaid patients and even if they do, they are the last patients doctors want to see. Also, many of our best medical centers won’t take Medicaid managed care. Medicaid rates are often half the prices charged at walk-in clinics and urgent care centers. Even if some accept Medicaid fees, they rarely locate in areas where Medicaid enrollees live. One answer is to let Medicaid patients buy medical care the way they buy food. In the supermarket, low-income shoppers are free to combine food stamp funds with out-of-pocket money and pay market prices. In health care we have made that option illegal. In a reformed system, Medicaid enrollees could still get free care at the emergency room, and possibly lose a day’s pay. (The in-and-out time at Parkland, a safety net hospital in Dallas, is almost 6 hours!) Or they could save time and taxpayer money by getting care where middle-class patients go. If this reform (coupled with the 24/7 primary care described below) cut Medicaid emergency room spending in half, it would save the federal and state governments as much as $135 billion over 10 years. Roth Health Savings Accounts. Private companies managing Medicaid (or the state itself) should be ableto make deposits to an account that would cover, say, all primary care. Enrollees would be restricted to using the money for health care during an insurance year. Afterward, they could withdraw any unspent funds for any purpose. If there were no penalties for non-medical withdrawals, health care and non-health care would trade against each other on a level playing field under the tax law. People wouldn’t spend a dollar on health care unless they got a dollar’s worth of value. An early study by the RAND Corporation suggests that these accounts would reduce Medicaid spending by 30 percent. Aside from payments for the disabled and nursing home care, if Medicaid spending could be reduced by 30 percent, the savings would amount to almost $1 trillion over ten years. This saving would be shared by the beneficiaries and the taxpayers who fund Medicaid. We could probably double that number by creative programs of self-management and self-directed care for the rest of the Medicaid population. 24/7 primary care. What we used to call concierge medicine is now commonly called 'direct primary care' (DPC) and the prices have come way down. In a national model that originated in Wichita, Kansas, the monthly fee is $50 for a mother and $10 for a child. In return the family gets the doctor’s phone number and 24/7 access to all primary care.

They could make deposits to these accounts and let enrollees pay market prices for their care. They could also allow HSA money to be used to pay the fees of direct primary care doctors, providing 24/7 care.

What Should Republicans Do About Medicaid? – OpEd	Republicans are in a bind. In order to give substance to their new budget bill, they need to cut Medicaid spending by billions of dollars. Yet the White House and many congressional Republicans insist that they do not want to cut Medicaid benefits. Here is where DOGE can come to the rescue. In mainstream economics there is a technical definition of 'waste.' A system is wasteful if it is possible to make a change that can in principle make everyone better off. Fortunately, Medicaid is so inefficient that it provides us with a rich bundle of opportunities. We can make changes that vastly improve services for the beneficiaries and free up billions in savings for the tax bill—at the same time. Here are some examples. Paying market prices. When people are newly enrolled in Medicaid, their visits to the ER increase by 40 percent! A likely reason is that many doctors won’t see Medicaid patients and even if they do, they are the last patients doctors want to see. Also, many of our best medical centers won’t take Medicaid managed care. Medicaid rates are often half the prices charged at walk-in clinics and urgent care centers. Even if some accept Medicaid fees, they rarely locate in areas where Medicaid enrollees live. One answer is to let Medicaid patients buy medical care the way they buy food. In the supermarket, low-income shoppers are free to combine food stamp funds with out-of-pocket money and pay market prices. In health care we have made that option illegal. In a reformed system, Medicaid enrollees could still get free care at the emergency room, and possibly lose a day’s pay. (The in-and-out time at Parkland, a safety net hospital in Dallas, is almost 6 hours!) Or they could save time and taxpayer money by getting care where middle-class patients go. If this reform (coupled with the 24/7 primary care described below) cut Medicaid emergency room spending in half, it would save the federal and state governments as much as $135 billion over 10 years. Roth Health Savings Accounts. Private companies managing Medicaid (or the state itself) should be ableto make deposits to an account that would cover, say, all primary care. Enrollees would be restricted to using the money for health care during an insurance year. Afterward, they could withdraw any unspent funds for any purpose. If there were no penalties for non-medical withdrawals, health care and non-health care would trade against each other on a level playing field under the tax law. People wouldn’t spend a dollar on health care unless they got a dollar’s worth of value. An early study by the RAND Corporation suggests that these accounts would reduce Medicaid spending by 30 percent. Aside from payments for the disabled and nursing home care, if Medicaid spending could be reduced by 30 percent, the savings would amount to almost $1 trillion over ten years. This saving would be shared by the beneficiaries and the taxpayers who fund Medicaid. We could probably double that number by creative programs of self-management and self-directed care for the rest of the Medicaid population. 24/7 primary care. What we used to call concierge medicine is now commonly called 'direct primary care' (DPC) and the prices have come way down. In a national model that originated in Wichita, Kansas, the monthly fee is $50 for a mother and $10 for a child. In return the family gets the doctor’s phone number and 24/7 access to all primary care. This is a competitive market and if at any time the family is unsatisfied, they can switch to another DPC doctor. Currently, employers are not allowed to put funds in an HSA to be used for DPC. By contrast, the Roth HSAs for Medicaid described above would be a perfect vehicle to facilitate DPC. Reducing fraud. According to the General Accounting Office, fraud in Medicare and Medicaid amounts to $100 billion a year, and the office admits that’s a low estimate.

The Democrats’ Necessary Apology – OpEd	An old friend asked me to write a short piece on what I think we (progressives) should do now. I mentioned some immediate ways to stem the Trump Blitzkrieg. I largely agree with the Nicholas Kristof price of eggs approach, although I think it’s also essential to demonize 'Elon the Nazi.' Politicians should be embarrassed to take his money, just as they would be embarrassed to take money from ISIS or Al Queda. But the Democrats really do need to take some big steps to reform themselves. There are many good progressive policies they should be pushing, like a big hike in the minimum wage, cracking down on drug prices, preventing insurers from ripping people off. But they also need a moment of reckoning with their past. The Democrats were considered the party of the establishment in the 2024 election. This is a bad place to be when people are angry. And people have cause to be angry. The Democrats supported a variety of policies that had the effect of redistributing income upward, from ordinary workers to highly paid workers (e.g. professionals, high-level corporate executives, and Wall Street types). The most visible policy in this category was trade. And Democrats have their fingerprint all over it, with NAFTA having been signed by Clinton and China being admitted to the WTO, also under Clinton. It’s true that more Republicans than Democrats in Congress supported these trade policies, but that doesn’t matter. The person sitting in the White House was a Democrat. And these deals really were bad news for workers without college degrees. By exposing manufacturing workers to direct competition with low-paid workers in China and other developing countries they cost the country millions of good-paying union jobs in manufacturing, and they lowered the pay for the jobs that remain. With unionization rates in manufacturing now only slightly higher than the rest of the private sector, the wage premium that workers used to enjoy in manufacturing has largely been eliminated. Not only was the Democrats’ trade policy very bad news for the country’s workers. They also lied about it. I don’t know how many times I have seen this graph showing manufacturing employment as a share of total employment. The story here is that there is a steady decline from the 1970s until 2010. In this story, there is nothing to see in the decade of the 00s, when the trade deficit exploded. But then there is the other graph showing manufacturing employment since 1970. The basic story is that there are cyclical ups and downs, but only a modest decline until 2000. Then we lost 3.4 million manufacturing jobs, 20 percent of all manufacturing jobs, from 2000 to 2007, before the Great Recession. This was the impact of trade. Millions of workers saw their lives ruined. Cities and towns across the Midwest saw their main employers lay off much of their labor force or go out of business altogether. The workers and communities affected have a right to be angry. Also, we should be clear, it was a lie to say this was 'free trade.' We didn’t expose our doctors to competition with their lower paid counterparts in the developing world or even Europe and Canada. As a result, our doctors get paid twice as much as doctors in other wealthy countries. We also made government-granted patent and copyright monopolies longer and stronger, a move that is 180 degrees at odds with free trade. This redistributed a huge amount of income upward, most obviously in the case of prescription drugs. We pay hundreds of billions of dollars a year ($4,000 per household) more than we would if drugs were sold in a free market. Pushing trade deals that were designed to screw ordinary workers and redistribute income upward predictably made the victims angry at the Democrats. An apology is definitely in order, even (especially) if that means throwing Bill Clinton under the bus.

Criticism Of Israel Is Misrepresented As Anti-Semitism – OpEd	By Jonathan Power In the New York Times, columnist Roger Cohen argued that anyone who queries the Jewish right to Israel is anti-Semitic. More than that, he accuses us of being racist, even though many of us fought against South African apartheid. He accuses us of 'pursuing the systematic 'Nazification' of Israel.' This is accusation by association. Israelis make this accusation daily. Let’s look at the facts. I’m anti-Israel, especially its present government, but for good reason I’m anti-Semitic. The Semitics bend history. After the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 70 the Jews were thrust into the outer world — many into Arab countries, later to become Muslim, where they were extended protection, and later into the Roman and then Christian world where they were accepted for many centuries. There were no pogroms until the Middle Ages and then they were centuries apart. Over two millennia many big tribal groups have been dispersed — the Slavs, the Moguls, the Bantu, the Kurds, the Tamils, the Celts — the list is a long one — but only the Jews have had an idée fixe about where they want to go back to. During the last thousand years, while the Jews were in the diaspora, the Arabs reinforced their settlements on the same land that some Jews yearned for, just as pre-Arab tribes had settled it in the time before Moses — and just as the Celts settled in Ireland, the Europeans in North America, the Moguls in India and the Russians in Siberia. When in 1897 the rabbis of Vienna sent a fact-finding mission to Palestine, they reported back that the bride 'was beautiful but married to another man.' Theodor Herzl, the convenor of the first Zionist Conference, was not obsessed by a return to Palestine. Almost anywhere would do. Argentina was the first choice with its empty fertile spaces. The Uasin Gishu plateau near Nairobi, Kenya, was another. But the Zionist conference overruled him. The course of the First World War and the likely break-up of the Ottoman Empire led the British to think that Jewish control of Palestine would be more secure for British interests than Arab. In 1917 came the Balfour Declaration whereby the British cabinet declared that they viewed 'with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.' Lord Curzon, the former Indian viceroy, denounced it as an act of 'sentimental idealism' and said ironically that Britain had a 'stronger claim to parts of France.' Old Testament According to the texts of the Old Testament, the ultra-religious, settlement inclined, Israelis have it partly right — the whole of Palestine did once belong to them. But only partly. Read Genesis. When the Lord spoke to Moses and told him that he would deliver the Jews from Egypt he also said he would bring them into 'a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.' In other words, the Jews were to conquer and displace other tribes who had been long possessors of the land now called Palestine, and even other tribes further south such as the Midianites. Later in the Book of Numbers, the Lord told Moses to 'vex the Midianites and smite them'. Moses and his army did. 'They slew all the males' and took the women and children captive. Then Moses said to his commanders, 'Have you saved all the women alive?……Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him.' He claimed that God told him to do this. The Jews would stop at almost nothing. Genocide, on occasion, was the tool of total conquest. Is this the proud history that present day Jews are fighting to uphold millennia later? The Jews of the Old Testament were as cruel as the Moguls and Tartars, and it is as difficult to justify the present-day Israeli occupation of Palestine as it would be to justify a Mogul regime in Russia or an Islamic one in northern India. If the Jews want the rest of the world’s sympathy, they have to be able to justify their modern-day presence in Palestine better than they do. They have to recognize how wrong were their conquests, both old and present. But now the Jews are in Palestine in such significant numbers the only solution is to honour the rest of the text of the Balfour Declaration. 'Nothing should be done that may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine', it said. This was the British condition. The Israelis overlook it today at their peril.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlAf3IDnsLhOv	2025-03-11T17:20:54-07:00

Cracking Down On US Colleges, For Israel – OpEd	The United States government does not need to give a dime to any college. But, if it does continue its funding of colleges, the First Amendment of the US Constitution bars that funding from being denied to a college because the college is determined to have insufficiently prevented speech the US government opposes, such as speech the US government deems to be critical of the Israel government. For this reason, President Trump’s effort to crack down on and bar funding to colleges the US executive branch concludes have insufficiently prevented anti-Israel or 'antisemitic' speech should be, and can be expected to be, struck down by courts. ('Antisemitic' under the peculiar definition being pushed by the Trump administration includes speech against the Israel government, not just speech against an ethnicity or religion as the term 'antisemitic' is generally understood to indicate.) This conclusion of unconstitutionality follows from a basic understanding of constitutional law that System Update host and astute politics commentator Glenn Greenwald described well in a video monologue he released this week.

Azerbaijan Creates Pathway To Reconciliation With Russia	(Eurasianet) -- An arrangement is in place that would allow Azerbaijan and Russia to move on from a bitter dispute over the accidental Russian shoot-down of an Azerbaijani civilian passenger jet. Russia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since late December when the Azerbaijani plane bound for the city of Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya was accidentally hit by anti-aircraft flak and ultimately crash landed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people aboard. The refusal of Russian officials to take responsibility for the crash and apologize stoked a series of acrimonious verbal exchanges between officials in Baku and Moscow, threatening to cause a rupture in their strategic partnership. In late February, however, the tone of the bilateral tiff shifted noticeably. It started with a post on the Telegram social media channel by Chechnya’s warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov, announcing that he will award medals for valor to the two plane crew members who survived the crash. He added that a memorial plaque to the crash victims will be installed in the Chechen capital. 'Their actions have become an example of true service and humanity,' Kadyrov wrote, referring to the plane’s crew members. Kadyrov’s comments apparently have soothed tempers in Baku and opened a pathway to reconciliation. In the days immediately after the crash, Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev reportedly refused to take a call from Kadyrov. Azerbaijani anger stemmed from the fact that Kadyrov had awarded a medal to his nephew for supposedly leading a stout air defense against a Ukrainian drone attack on Grozny shortly before the Azerbaijani airliner was hit by flak. The official stance in Baku towards Chechnya immediately softened following Kadyrov’s good-will gesture. 'The decision by Chechen authorities to award certain individuals after the crash understandably sparked strong outrage in Azerbaijani society. However, investigations have confirmed—and Azerbaijan has precise information—that the Chechen leadership had no involvement or responsibility in the incident,' a government source was quoted as saying by the Trend news agency on February 27. The source also told Trend that Russian military personnel were directly responsible for bringing the plane down. 'In Azerbaijan, the voiced position on this matter is deemed acceptable, even if it comes late,' the source added, referring to Kadyrov. Economic considerations are likely the reason for Baku’s softening stance. 'Despite the tensions, both sides have too much to lose from a lasting fallout,' Maxim Trudolyubov, an expert at the Kennan Institute in Washington, stated in an analysis published by the institute’s website. 'Russia relies on Azerbaijan for transport routes vital to its relations with Iran and the Persian Gulf, while Baku’s geopolitical pragmatism and shared strategic interests will likely push both countries toward reconciliation—though on terms that reflect Azerbaijan’s growing assertiveness.' Baku’s apparent absolution of Chechen involvement makes it easier for Putin to find a way to satisfy Azerbaijani complaints. Chechnya is perhaps the only corner of Russia where Putin’s word is not law; Kadyrov controls a private army numbering in the tens of thousands and operates with a wide degree of latitude from Moscow. In short, Putin couldn’t easily pin the blame on Chechens and compel Kadyrov to come up with some scapegoats for punishment. Now, Putin has a bit more leeway to act. If he so desires, he can identify a few unfortunate Russian recruits for punishment and all parties involved can move on. The question now is whether Putin will walk through the door that Azerbaijan has opened for him?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlGa0gBnU2P4q	2025-03-11T17:16:27-07:00

The question now is whether Putin will walk through the door that Azerbaijan has opened for him?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcyPosbFQglLdGzqSts9U-	2025-03-11T17:16:27-07:00	
Portugal’s Government Collapses After Confidence Vote (Again)	By Charles Szumski Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro's centre-right government lost a crucial vote of confidence amid a conflict of interest scandal, reigniting a cycle of dysfunction in the country's poiltics that stretches back years. Montenegro's government collapsed late Tuesday just over a year after his Democratic Alliance took power. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is expected to announce a snap election for mid-May. Scandals The current political turmoil stemmed from allegations concerning Montenegro's family business, Spinumviva, a consultancy firm specialising in compliance and personal data protection services. Investigations revealed that the company continued receiving payments from clients, including the casino group Solverde, even after Montenegro assumed office as prime minister in 2024. Montenegro's transfer of shares in the company to his wife also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. The revelations led opposition parties, notably the Socialist Party and the far-right Chega, to announce their intention to vote against the government's confidence motion. increasing the likelihood of early elections later this year instead of in March 2028. Critics said new elections alone would not solve the underlying culture of corruption that many observers fear has taken hold of Portuguese politics. 'Elections do not replace or dispense with explanations,' Portuguese commentator Pedro Norton wrote on Publico, warning that the scandal would further corrode the health of Portugal's battered democracy. Third time's the charm With the fall of the Montenegro government, Portugal will have held three general elections in three years. The first was in January 2022, following the rejection of the Socialist Party (PS) government's budget in October 2021. The impasse led President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to dissolve parliament and call early elections. The PS, then led by Prime Minister António Costa, the current Council president, secured an absolute majority and formed a new government in March of the same year. In November 2023 however, Costa's administration was embroiled in a corruption scandal of its own involving his chief of staff, Vítor Escária, and Infrastructure Minister João Galamba. The investigation, known as Operation Influencer, centred on alleged irregularities in the awarding of contracts for lithium mining, green hydrogen projects, and data centres in the country. Under mounting pressure, Costa resigned, leading to early elections in March 2024. These elections brought Montenegro's centre-right Democratic Alliance to power with a minority government. However, his tenure was short-lived. Far-right boon The succession of political crises has led to frequent electoral cycles and heightened public disenchantment with traditional political institutions. According to sociologist António Barreto, quoted by Publico, the repeated political crisis caused two of the most damaging phenomena in the country's life: abstention from politics and the far-right party Chega. The instability has created fertile ground for populist movements, notably the far-right party, which has capitalised on the prevailing discontent to expand its influence. During the last elections, Chega secured 18.1% of the vote, resulting in 50 seats in the 230-member Assembly of the Republic, ranking third after the Socialist party and the centre-right Social Democrats. Portuguese voters did not respond to calls for a 'meaningful vote,' resulting in the 'most fragmented parliament ever', and with Chega being the 'big winner' of the last election, according to political experts who then spoke to Euractiv's partner Lusa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlNy5i4sYWtgx	2025-03-11T17:10:57-07:00

Trump’s Address To Congress Highlights The Absence Of Opposition ...	The relentless resistance that defined Trump's first term has faded into an unsettling quiet. A perfect storm of factors has granted him relatively unchecked power to push drastic domestic and international changes. During his address to Congress on March 4, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump faced brief heckling from Democratic Representative AI Green and scattered jeers from his colleagues. But the overwhelming response was silence, reflective of the reality that opposition to Trump has sharply weakened, even as his administration pushes sweeping domestic and international policy upheaval. The opening weeks of his first term in January 2017 were met with fierce resistance, and not just from combative Democrats. People came together to protest against Trump's immigration policies and his proposed travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Republican politicians openly defied him amid constant media scrutiny. Clashes with the so-called 'deep state' due to intelligence leaks escalated when the FBI publicly confirmed an investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election. These combined tensions defined his first term, culminating in him being temporarily banned from most major social media platforms and leading to widespread condemnation and isolation after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Now, at the start of his second term, opposition is notably subdued. The Women's March that drew millions in 2017, becoming 'the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history,' according to the New York Times, seems to have 'lost its luster' during his second term. The February 5 protest against Trump and Elon Musk's policies drew a low turnout, mostly confined to liberal enclaves, and the 2025 Oscars—once a stage for political grandstanding—avoided directly critiquing the president. Even Green's disruption caused dissent within his own party, with 10 Democrats censuring him the next day. Political and institutional fatigue, shifting cultural dynamics, and strategic alignment by corporations, billionaires, politicians, and other public figures have blunted resistance, leaving the Trump administration with fewer obstacles as it pushes forward with its agenda. One major factor is the weakness and division within the Democratic Party, preventing grassroots progressives from working with top-level establishment Democrats. After years of Biden attempting to balance the party's competing factions, tensions rose significantly following his response to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas. Trump's victory a year later—securing both the electoral college and popular vote—has only deepened these fractures, fueling a blame game that contrasts with the unity following Trump's narrower 2016 election victory. The party's electoral failures are compounded by the absence of a unifying figure. Nancy Pelosi is no longer speaker, and while Chuck Schumer is the Senate minority leader, both of them are old and unpopular. Bernie Sanders, who is in his 80s, represents a sidelined progressive movement that has struggled to elevate new, dynamic leaders due to years of suppression by establishment Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has failed to offer new solutions, only deepening apathy and fatigue. Without organizational cohesion and the ability to inspire its base, the Democratic Party has been unable to marshal its diverse coalition against Trump's agenda. The issue that has mobilized progressives in large numbers in recent years is Palestine, which establishment Democrats are reluctant to support, including the recent arrest and threatened deportation of pro-Palestinian student Mahmoud Khalil. Losing young male voters has further weakened the party's ability to generate active dissent. Its association with progressive identity politics has meanwhile alienated broader segments of the electorate, with Biden having failed to address glaring economic issues and matters like crime and immigration during his presidency. On the Republican side, dissenting voices like Mitt Romney and the late John McCain are gone, and those who still might challenge Trump within the party fear backlash and isolation. 'Never Trump' conservative groups have struggled to pull voters away, while Trump's systemic dismantling of government bureaucracy (historically staffed with left-leaning officials) and the appointment of loyalists to key positions have cemented his control over the government and prevented institutional attempts to undermine him. With Republican control over all three branches of government, a conservative-majority Supreme Court, and Trump loyalists installed across federal agencies, his power—though often overstated—far surpasses that of his first term. Executive orders, constrained by previous presidents, are now being deployed at an unprecedented rate. His administration's ambitious federal restructuring efforts, tied to the Project 2025 framework, go beyond the government overhauls of Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission or Bill Clinton's bipartisan National Performance Review. Yet, Democratic disarray has left these efforts largely unchecked. Trump's progress also hinges on the support of the ultrawealthy. The Democratic Party is experiencing a funding shortfall, not just from grassroots donors but from major oligarchs as well. Meanwhile, Trump has secured broader public backing from America's corporate elite. Years of frustration with Democrats and the political left over issues like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, taxation, and regulations have pushed many business leaders toward his camp. This repositioning was on full display at Trump's inauguration, where Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more wealthy individuals were given front-row seats. Google's decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America,' a Trump executive order, signals the larger realignment across corporate America. No billionaire has played a more consequential role than Elon Musk. Though his relationship with Trump was rocky just a few years ago, Musk's endorsement of Trump in July 2024 cemented a powerful alliance between them. Musk's control of X (formerly Twitter) not only reintroduced Trump to the media platform but also helped normalize his return to other social media networks. Meanwhile, Democrats have struggled to maintain their online presence amid declining engagement and financial strain. This realignment has extended into the corporate media landscape. The aggressive anti-Trump narratives that dominated his first term have softened, driven by audience backlash against media institutions and wider progressive messaging. With traditional media outlets facing declining viewership, and the growing influence of oligarchic forces now backing Trump, the media's pivot is as much about survival as it is about political recalibration. Signs of this emerged even before the election. Jeff Bezos, who has owned the Washington Post since 2013, withdrew the paper's endorsement of Kamala Harris, as did billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times. CNN, under new leadership since 2023, has steadily adopted a more centrist tone, shedding high-profile anti-Trump figures like Don Lemon. MSNBC is undergoing an even more dramatic transformation, with outspoken Trump critics like Joy Reid and Alex Wagner losing their primetime slots in February 2025, while there has been scaling back of influence of others like Rachel Maddow in favor of less combative voices. Emboldened by a changing media environment, Trump is increasingly punishing outlets. The Associated Press was banned from presidential events in February after declining to adopt the 'Gulf of America' name. CBS remains embroiled in a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over an edited interview with Kamala Harris, with Musk declaring that CBS reporters 'deserve a long prison sentence.' Meanwhile, Disney-ABC settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump for $15 million and recently replaced a transgender character from a new series with a Christian one. Meta, too, in January 2025, settled for $25 million for banning Trump from Facebook and Instagram after January 6. While these are small fines for corporate giants, they symbolize an increasing subservience to Trump, with both payments directed toward funding Trump's presidential library. It's hardly surprising that Trump appears so powerful at this moment. Political opposition is fractured, leaving no effective barriers to Trump's agenda. Many oligarchs have given him their quiet or public approval, as seen during his inauguration. The media's softened stance has shaped a perception of reduced conflict. The absence of strong opposition has created new momentum as political, corporate, and media institutions adapt to this shifting power balance instead of fighting it, reducing the public's appetite for resistance as well. For now, Trump is riding high after his election victory. But cracks are beginning to show. Public resistance to Musk's influence is growing, and the economic turbulence triggered by Trump's policies is stirring unease. Without a strong and combative adversary, Trump and his most ardent supporters may find themselves without a rallying cause. International stability could further test his power, and the reality of governance may prove far more challenging than dismantling what came before. Is this already the peak of Trump's power, or can it be sustained? Opposition to Trump fluctuated during his first term, yet today, the political, business, and cultural landscapes have adjusted in his favor. His greatest advantage, however, may be the quiet acquiescence of elites from various backgrounds. While some may oppose him openly, many are content to let events play out due to self-interest or inertia. About the author: John P.

South Africa: Call For Collaboration To Boost Infrastructure Inve...	President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasised the need for strong collaboration between government and business to scale up infrastructure investment and drive South Africa’s economic growth.Speaking during a Questions for Oral Reply session in the National Assembly on Tuesday, the President highlighted the importance of structural reforms to address key constraints, such as energy supply and inefficiencies in freight and logistics. 'For South Africa to achieve the levels of economic growth it needs, it is essential that government and business work together to scale up investment in infrastructure.'Government has committed to an ambitious infrastructure build programme. Infrastructure spend by government will encourage and enable greater private sector investment in sectors such as electricity generation, electricity distribution, rail rolling-stock, and water distribution,' the President said. However, he stressed the distinction between public and private financial resources, particularly pension funds held by financial institutions. These funds, he noted, belong to workers and are intended for their retirement, making them private assets rather than State resources.To facilitate infrastructure investment, the President said that government needs to provide these savers with a reasonable return and ensure that these funds are safeguarded. In 2022, National Treasury amended Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act to allow for longer-term infrastructure investments by retirement funds. The changes introduced a definition of infrastructure and set a 45% upper limit for pension fund investments in infrastructure projects.Further regulatory adjustments have been made to facilitate economic development, including separating the investment limits for hedge funds and private equity. The allocation for private equity assets has been increased from 10% to 15%, allowing for greater infrastructure investments.In the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement of October 2024, the Minister of Finance announced work underway on mechanisms to complement the changes to Regulation 28 through the development of specific investment vehicles to simplify and incentivise institutional investors. The President said details on these mechanisms will be published in the upcoming Budget, which is expected to be delivered on Wednesday, 12 March 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlEHVzdL_0VhC	2025-03-11T17:06:17-07:00

Five Takeaways From China’s National People’s Congress	By Qian Lang, Yitong Wu and Ha Syut China’s 10-day National People Congress ended in Beijing on Tuesday amid sweeping promises from the country’s leaders to boost economic growth, support AI and to take control over democratic Taiwan. Delegates also shed light on Beijing’s intentions for Tibet and revealed for the first time that U.S. sanctions on companies in Xinjiang using Uyghur forced labor are hurting business. Here are five takeaways: China aims to spur consumer spending amid looming trade war with US In his March 5 work report, Premier Li Qiang pledged to boost domestic consumption as the driving force for economic growth, which he set at 5% for the coming year -- a target experts say is highly questionable and likely concocted for political reasons. For years, exports have driven China’s growth. But leaders have tried to shift the focus to consumer spending after three years of COVID-19 restrictions and a slew of U.S. tariffs prompted manufacturers to move away from China and spooked foreign investors. And now President Donald Trump has imposed additional tariffs on Chinese exports to America. To shore up the economy, the government plans to boost fiscal spending by 1.2 trillion yuan (US$165 billion) to 29.7 trillion yuan (US$4.16 billion), Li said -- but gave few details of how that money would be spent. He also pledged to implement 'an appropriately accommodative monetary policy' in the coming year. 'The impact of this National People’s Congress on the Chinese people is that their economy is now moving from strength to weakness, and this weakness will be long term,' social economist Ji Rong told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. One proposal discussed by delegates to the 10-day National People’s Congress in Beijing was shortening the working week to four-and-a-half days to give people more leisure time. The government will also further cut the personal income tax rate in a bid to boost purchasing power among middle- and low-earners. An economic commentator who gave only the surname Hong for fear of reprisals said changes to the working week could prove effective, but that Li’s work report contained few other practical measures. AI and high-tech seen as key sources of growth Li Qiang also vowed to 'unleash the creativity of the digital economy,' particularly through the use of AI. 'We will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing equipment, including intelligent connected new-energy vehicles, AI-enabled phones and computers, and intelligent robots,' he told delegates. Li was speaking weeks after China’s launched its DeepSeek AI model, in what some called a 'Sputnik moment' for the country. Li also promised increased funding for AI, biomanufacturing, quantum technology and 6G, without giving further details. But experts said China will continue to be hampered by U.S. export and high-tech bans, including for cutting-edge semiconductors. China’s increasingly powerful AI surveillance systems use facial recognition and combine data streams to create sophisticated 'city brains' that can track events in real time, and are increasingly being exported around the world, according to a recent report. The technology is also raising concerns about its use to treat patients by medical professionals, as well as to aid cheating in competitions (in Chinese). Tibetan officials vow to expand ideological education and Sinicize Tibetan Buddhism The Tibet Autonomous Region delegation vowed to strengthen efforts to fight 'separatism' and prioritize 'long-term stability' by expanding ideological education, as well as accelerate the Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism, which they said was key to 'changing the face of Tibet.' The delegates emphasized their commitment to ideological education guided by the 'Three Consciousnesses,' a phrase used in Chinese propaganda to refer to national -- or Han Chinese -- consciousness, civic duties and the rule of law. 'I believe this kind of education is highly effective,' said Karma Tseten, deputy head of the delegation and Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, or TAR. 'Despite its value, it is constantly smeared and disrupted by the Dalai Lama and his group. But we will not be swayed.' The rhetoric was a clear sign, experts said, that Beijing intends to continue to impose its repressive policies in Tibet under the guise of maintaining stability and combating separatism. 'Regardless of what policies China implements in Tibet, their stated goal of ‘maintaining stability’ fundamentally reveals that Tibetans do not trust the Chinese government,' Dawa Tsering, director at the Tibet Policy Institute, told Radio Free Asia. Delegates said at a media briefing on Thursday that more than 90 percent of community leaders in Tibet now had basic knowledge of Mandarin. They also emphasized that they will continue to focus on promoting in Tibet what China calls the 'four major events' -– border security, environment, stability and economic and social development. Top official from Uyghur region admits US sanctions are hurting businesses During the congress, the Chinese government acknowledged for the first time that U.S. sanctions over the use of Uyghur forced labor have affected more than 100 companies in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region, or XUAR, proving that international sanctions do have bite. Ma Xingrui, the XUAR party secretary, told delegates that 'the United States, relying on fabricated evidence, has imposed sanctions on Xinjiang businesses based on allegations of genocide and forced labor, affected more than 144 companies,' according to the China Daily. Sanctions 'over accusations of ‘forced labor’ have become one of the biggest challenges in the region’s development,' Ma said during a panel discussion Friday at the NPC, according to the report. While Ma didn’t elaborate on which companies were affected, this marks the first time the region’s highest party official admitted the sanctions were hurting businesses. The United States and nearly a dozen Western parliaments have accused China of committing genocide and crimes against humanity against the 13 million Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples living in Xinjiang. In 2021, the U.S. government has passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese businesses judged to be using Uyghur forced labor. Since then, some 144 companies have been blacklisted. These sanctions are undermining the economic development of Xinjiang, which is a chief way that Beijing 'wants to extend the legitimacy of its rule,' said Raymond Kuo, a China expert at Rand Corporation, a Washington think tank. 'Ultimately, the economic benefits that come from [Beijing’s] rule are going to be the key thing to increase the legitimacy of its rule as well as win over the population,' he said. 'Western sanctions inhibit that.' The sanctions are 'particularly politically important for Xinjiang,' Kuo added. 'They’re clearly having some impact, right?' China to boost military spending by 7.2% China is increasing its 2025 defense budget by 7.2% to US$246 billion amid growing rivalry with the United States and tensions over Taiwan, marking the fourth consecutive year of more than 7% growth in defense spending. Li said Beijing would continue to 'resolutely oppose separatist activities' in democratic Taiwan, as well as what he termed 'external interference.' China has ramped up military activities around Taiwan, conducting frequent air and naval incursions into the island’s air defense identification zone and staging large-scale drills near its waters. Beijing views Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory and insists on eventual unification, by force if necessary. Yet Li also vowed a soft power charm offensive to push for what Beijing calls 'peaceful unification.' 'We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-Strait development,' he said. 'We will firmly advance the cause of China’s unification.' Military expert Pang Xinhua said China’s neighbors in the region are also worried about escalating military tensions. 'As China increases its military activities in the South China Sea, East China Sea and other regions, neighboring countries may worry about rising regional tensions leading to an escalating arms race,' Pang told RFA Mandarin. 'That could in turn lead to an escalation of the situation in the Taiwan Strait, as China’s continued strengthening of its military capabilities is interpreted as pressure on Taiwan,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlAEZI-TXy18H	2025-03-11T17:01:07-07:00	
Five Takeaways From China’s National People’s Congress	By Qian Lang, Yitong Wu and Ha Syut China’s 10-day National People Congress ended in Beijing on Tuesday amid sweeping promises from the country’s leaders to boost economic growth, support AI and to take control over democratic Taiwan. Delegates also shed light on Beijing’s intentions for Tibet and revealed for the first time that U.S. sanctions on companies in Xinjiang using Uyghur forced labor are hurting business. Here are five takeaways: China aims to spur consumer spending amid looming trade war with US In his March 5 work report, Premier Li Qiang pledged to boost domestic consumption as the driving force for economic growth, which he set at 5% for the coming year -- a target experts say is highly questionable and likely concocted for political reasons. For years, exports have driven China’s growth. But leaders have tried to shift the focus to consumer spending after three years of COVID-19 restrictions and a slew of U.S. tariffs prompted manufacturers to move away from China and spooked foreign investors. And now President Donald Trump has imposed additional tariffs on Chinese exports to America. To shore up the economy, the government plans to boost fiscal spending by 1.2 trillion yuan (US$165 billion) to 29.7 trillion yuan (US$4.16 billion), Li said -- but gave few details of how that money would be spent. He also pledged to implement 'an appropriately accommodative monetary policy' in the coming year. 'The impact of this National People’s Congress on the Chinese people is that their economy is now moving from strength to weakness, and this weakness will be long term,' social economist Ji Rong told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. One proposal discussed by delegates to the 10-day National People’s Congress in Beijing was shortening the working week to four-and-a-half days to give people more leisure time. The government will also further cut the personal income tax rate in a bid to boost purchasing power among middle- and low-earners. An economic commentator who gave only the surname Hong for fear of reprisals said changes to the working week could prove effective, but that Li’s work report contained few other practical measures. AI and high-tech seen as key sources of growth Li Qiang also vowed to 'unleash the creativity of the digital economy,' particularly through the use of AI. 'We will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing equipment, including intelligent connected new-energy vehicles, AI-enabled phones and computers, and intelligent robots,' he told delegates. Li was speaking weeks after China’s launched its DeepSeek AI model, in what some called a 'Sputnik moment' for the country. Li also promised increased funding for AI, biomanufacturing, quantum technology and 6G, without giving further details. But experts said China will continue to be hampered by U.S. export and high-tech bans, including for cutting-edge semiconductors. China’s increasingly powerful AI surveillance systems use facial recognition and combine data streams to create sophisticated 'city brains' that can track events in real time, and are increasingly being exported around the world, according to a recent report. The technology is also raising concerns about its use to treat patients by medical professionals, as well as to aid cheating in competitions (in Chinese). Tibetan officials vow to expand ideological education and Sinicize Tibetan Buddhism The Tibet Autonomous Region delegation vowed to strengthen efforts to fight 'separatism' and prioritize 'long-term stability' by expanding ideological education, as well as accelerate the Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism, which they said was key to 'changing the face of Tibet.' The delegates emphasized their commitment to ideological education guided by the 'Three Consciousnesses,' a phrase used in Chinese propaganda to refer to national -- or Han Chinese -- consciousness, civic duties and the rule of law. 'I believe this kind of education is highly effective,' said Karma Tseten, deputy head of the delegation and Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, or TAR. 'Despite its value, it is constantly smeared and disrupted by the Dalai Lama and his group. But we will not be swayed.' The rhetoric was a clear sign, experts said, that Beijing intends to continue to impose its repressive policies in Tibet under the guise of maintaining stability and combating separatism. 'Regardless of what policies China implements in Tibet, their stated goal of ‘maintaining stability’ fundamentally reveals that Tibetans do not trust the Chinese government,' Dawa Tsering, director at the Tibet Policy Institute, told Radio Free Asia.

Was October 7 Avoidable? – OpEd	After the Hamas-led offensive of October 7, 2023, it was portrayed as 'Israel’s 9/11,' which came out of the blue. Yet, this assumption is not supported by verified facts, including ignored intelligence, abandoned hostages and neglected Israeli communities around Gaza. A day after October 7, Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer said that the 'massive attacks by Hamas leadership into Israel … is no less than Israel’s 9/11.' By contrast, in the same interview for CNBC, I said that October 7 did not come out of the blue. 'The Israeli-Hamas War is a logical result of 50 years of failed military policies.' Our views were diametrically opposed. I had warned of the ticking time bomb in Gaza already in 2018, half a decade before. A day or two before October 7, I wrote an essay on the coming explosion in Gaza. It was not prophetic insight. October 7, 2023, was the 50-year anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and I fully expected a high-profile reaction. After the brutal Hamas-led assault, Israeli authorities vehemently condemned what they called 'our September 11' and a 'surprise attack.' But the hard questions were conveniently ignored – and still are. A week ago, the Israeli Defense Forces’ landmark investigations into the October 7 attack disclosed severe, deep-rooted intelligence miscalculations and fundamental misconceptions on the nature of Hamas and its intentions by both the Israeli government and military. Probing the same attack, Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, recently pointed fingers at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Typically, the prime mistakes featured the political conception of Hamas as an Israeli asset, the intelligence misjudgment that it couldn't launch a large-scale attack, and weak defensive deployment. The intriguing part of the story is that these facts were pretty well known already in the first days after October 7, 2023 – that is, more than a year ago – as I argue in The Fall of Israel. And there is more to the story. Why was the abundant intelligence on the impending Hamas attack deliberately ignored? Why were the Israeli hostages effectively abandoned? Why were the strategic border communities neglected? With all its might, backed up with U.S. military aid and financing, how did Israel fail to see the writing on the wall? Ignored intelligence After October 7, a high-level Egyptian intelligence official said Israel had ignored repeated warnings that 'an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big.' Netanyahu denied receiving any such advance warning. Yet, the Egyptian confirmed that the Israeli PM had received direct notice from Cairo’s intelligence minister. Similarly, Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters of the alleged warning. The inconvenient fact was that Israeli intelligence authorities had been aware of the threat for months yet ignored it. In November 2023, the New York Times reported that 'Israel knew Hamas’s attack plan more than a year ago.' Code-named Jericho Wall, the 40-page blueprint outlined a lethal invasion. The document had been circulated widely among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, but experts determined an attack of that scale and ambition was beyond Hamas’s capabilities. The Times report reverberated internationally. But it wasn’t a scoop. Right after October 7, several Israeli media released several reports indicating that many intelligence analysts’ warnings were ignored. What was new in the Times piece was the document verifying the story. There was also a potentially explosive issue behind the Israeli deaths. Not about 'friendly fire,' which is not uncommon amid fierce battles, but about the consequences of the Hannibal Directive, which many Israelis have charged was now the rule. This directive demands Israelis to kill their fellow soldiers and family members so that their kidnapping and the consequent prisoner exchanges can be avoided, presumably in the interest of a 'greater good.' The Hamas-led offensive was compounded by what some Israeli soldiers subsequently called a 'mass Hannibal.' Just days after October 7, testimonies from members of the mainly female lookout units bolstered accusations that Netanyahu’s leadership fatally misread the dangers from Gaza. In an Israeli TV segment, two soldiers, Yael Rotenberg and Maya Desiatnik, recounted their experiences in the months before the attack. Rotenberg frequently saw many Palestinians dressed in civilian clothing near the border fence with maps, scrutinizing the ground around it and digging holes. Once, when she passed the information on, she was told they were just farmers, and there was nothing to worry about. 'It’s infuriating,' said Desiatnik who served in Nahal Oz, where 20 other women border surveillance soldiers were murdered by Hamas. 'We saw what was happening, we told them about it, and we were the ones who were murdered.' Underpinning all these ignored warnings was the IDF’s assumption that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare to do so. The flawed supposition was fostered by two factors. First, gender bias. The longer the militarization has prevailed in Israel, the more the country’s gender gap –the difference between women and men as reflected in social, political, and economic attainments – has deepened. Today, Israel’s gender gap ranks at the level of El Salvador and Uganda. What, after all, did the 'girls' of the lookout units know? Moreover, the idea that Hamas lacked capability to attack was predicated on the belief the Palestinians were 'human animals,' as Netanyahu and the cabinet ministers called Hamas operatives. Subhumans cannot think out-of-the-box. In reality, based on over 1 year of evidence, Hamas militants had trained for the blitzattacks in at least six sites across Gaza in plain sight and less than 1.5 km from Israel’s heavily fortified and monitored border, as even the mainstream CNN concluded barely a week after October 7. Worse, many testimonies by Israeli witnesses to the Hamas attack indicate that the Israeli military killed its own citizens struggling to neutralize Palestinian gunmen, in accordance with the Hannibal Directive. As one witness said to Israel Radio: '[Israeli special forces] eliminated everyone, including the hostages.' Worse, in addition to the ignored intelligence, there were other issues that just didn’t add up, including the abandoned hostages, and the state of the long neglected Israeli communities surrounding Gaza. Abandoned hostages On October 7, 2023, as part of the overall Hamas-led offense, 251 people were abducted from Israel to the Gaza Strip, including children, women and elderly. Almost half of the hostages were foreign nationals or had multiple citizenships. The next day, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed ex-military commander Gal Hirsch to coordinate the cross-governmental response to abducted civilians and soldiers. Internationally, the appointment was portrayed as the PM’s proactive move to ensure the timely release of the Israeli hostages. Little did they know. As brigadier general, Hirsch had commanded an IDF division during the 2006 Lebanon War, which saw the first test of the Dahiya doctrine, premised on the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Hirsch was seen as responsible for the blunder resulting in an abduction by Hezbollah militants and the battles of Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha’b, which the IDF failed to occupy, despite heavy casualties. Following a barrage of criticism, Hirsch was forced to resign. After years of career rehabilitation, he joined the dominant harsh-right party Likud at the behest of Netanyahu himself and became the favorite for the role of the national police chief in 2021 – until he and his business partners were indicted for tax evasion of $1.9 million in a case concerning arms sales to Georgia. Why did Netanyahu appoint as his hostage tsar a general who had already blundered one high-profile abduction affair, failed to protect his soldiers and had been indicted for corruption? Unsurprisingly, the families of the hostages concluded that, in the view of the Netanyahu government, the fate of the hostages was secondary to the pretext of October 7 for a massive ground assault. The realization led to bitter and divisive mass demonstrations against the government and for the release of the hostages that prevailed until recently. If the hostage families and many ordinary Israelis despised the government that seemed to ignore the fate of the abducted, they found it even harder to digest the idea that their government may have been responsible for the deliberate killing of their loved ones. Just days after October 7, early reports and interviews suggested that the IDF had detailed prior knowledge of the Hamas offensive three long weeks beforehand, based on information from military intelligence’s Unit 8200. Highlighting the extent to which the IDF’s Gaza Division was aware of a potential attack on Israel’s southern border communities, the document, which was ignored by senior officials, detailed a series of exercises conducted by Hamas’ elite Nukhba units in the weeks prior to its publication. One of the most shocking sections of the IDF report featured instructions relating to the taking of hostages, the number of which was estimated to be between 200–250, coming close to the actual 251 captives. Does this enumeration in the report reflect extraordinary foresight? Or does it – since its findings were blatantly ignored prior to October 7 – illustrate a deliberate intention to allow a certain extent of devastation, in order to permit a transformational event that would legitimize a broad-scale invasion and, ultimately, a war of obliteration? Such considerations, of course, have been quickly torpedoed as 'conspiracy theories.' However, as long as credible investigations are deferred or suppressed in advance, legitimate concerns prevail on the causes of devastation on October 7. And then, there was the odd issue of the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, which had been regarded as 'strategic' since the creation of Israel in 1948. Why had they been ignored as if they were 'non-strategic' for several years? Neglected Israeli communities When Israel was established, its founding fathers considered its border areas strategic. Adjacent to the Gaza Strip, these are the populated areas in Israel’s Southern District located within 7 km of the border and thus within the range of mortar shells and Qassam rockets. If these areas were strategic to national security, why were they so vulnerable on October 7? It is one thing that Israeli intelligence ignored over a year of warnings about the ability and willingness of Hamas to launch a major offensive. But it is another that the security of the surrounding Israeli border areas was effectively downplayed. Some of these settlements were created at the eve of the 1948 Arab Israeli War, including Sa’ad and Nirim, the two kibbutzim. The bigger ones were established soon after the 1949 Armistice Agreement, including Sderot, a development town for Mizrahi immigrants – that is, the Jews from the Middle East – and the military Nahal Oz, designed to become a civilian settlement and serve as a first line of defense against possible Arab incursions. In the early days of the Israeli state, many new arrivals from the Arab countries found themselves treated as 'more primitive' second-class citizens by the predominantly European-born Ashkenazi-Jewish elite. These subtle and not-so-subtle ethnic differences, compounded by visible 'white' and 'non-white' distinctions, continue to haunt the Israeli civil society. Yet, the Mizrahi Jews near Gaza faced additional challenges, and there were many Ashkenazis in these communities as well. Many of these localities were neglected, while some, particularly the immigrant development towns, felt shunned by their government. When Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967, border threats diminished until the First Intifada in the late 1980s and the rise of Hamas. Following Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, cross-border shelling and rocket attacks into Israel increased accordingly. To protect these areas, which now became known as the Gaza Envelope, the Israeli parliament Knesset enacted a law to assist the 'confrontation-line communities.' But when these measures expired in 2014 – a decade before October 7 – the district command of the IDF cut the associated budgets. This enraged many of the communities. After all, the 2014 Gaza War had caused a substantial adverse impact on the proximate settlements, due to rocket and mortar attacks, tunnels, intrusions, even incendiary kites. The war was followed by another wave of violence in 2018. And on October 7, many communities in the Gaza Envelope were infiltrated, with hundreds of Israelis butchered and kidnapped. Instead of protecting its citizens, Israel had retreated from its traditional security obligations to the adjacent Israeli communities. As evidenced by the national budget for the Gaza Envelope localities in 2014–2024, these communities were, as critics said, 'slated for abandonment following the November 2022 elections.' In effect, the per capita budgets approved for the years 2023-2024 were almost a third lower than that of 2022. So, well before October 7, the strategic needs of the Gaza Envelope of adjacent Israeli communities were effectively neglected by the government. However, the huge military border barrier prevailed. Between 2017 and 2021, to counter the many tunnels Palestinians dug for infiltration, Israel also constructed an underground border wall, equipped with sensors several meters in depth along the entire border. In Israel, the high-tech security barriers were portrayed as impenetrable. And yet, the IDF was tricked by Hamas’s messaging, over-relied on a remote-controlled surveillance systems and weapons that were swiftly disabled by drones and snipers, enabling its infiltration and onslaught. Furthermore, the builder of the barrier had warned already in 2018 that it absolutely required a military presence. It was not designed to prevent mass assault on its own. Unsurprisingly, the Hamas offensive caused a full breakdown in trust between the Israeli localities and their state, with residents reluctant to return to homes until security was fully ensured. As regional escalation spread to northern Israel, it shared the Gaza Envelope’s challenges, facing the rockets of the Hezbollah. By summer 2024, local leaders were warning the Netanyahu cabinet they planned to leave if the situation wouldn’t improve. 'Where is the government?' asked the chief of the regional council, Moshe Davidovitch. 'Even a banana republic does not work like this,' he added. 'The government is destroying the North.' Convenient narratives and inconvenient truths By May 2024, new evidence indicated that Israel’s intelligence failure was the net effect of a 'chain of failures' that pervaded the entire security sector, both in the Shin Bet and the IDF. The common denominator was the fallacy that Hamas was only able of firing long-range rockets against Israel. Whatever did not fit this theory was rejected. So, the warnings of the IDF female spotters were systematically ignored. What they saw as an impending mass attack intelligence officers dismissed as 'routine Hamas training.' Second, after the Gaza war in 2021, it was decided to cease intelligence-gathering on Hamas’ tactical array and the intermediate ranks of its military arm, to focus only on few individuals. Opposing views to this intelligence concept were marginalized. These failures were coupled with a sense of disdain in the intelligence culture, which viewed the border fence, together with the underground border barrier between Israel and Gaza, as denying Hamas the possibility of invading Israel. The 'Iron Wall' was considered impenetrable; for all the wrong reasons. In effect, Hamas operatives breached the border barrier at 44 different points. Consequently, the so-called intelligence failure on October 7 can be attributed primarily to the rejection of external warnings, denial of internal evidence, suppression of tactical intelligence, autocratic culture, and inflated perception of the effectiveness of the separation barriers. The ongoing investigation of the military is likely to stress similar factors. But was that the full story or a part of the story? In effect, what was the story? In the early conventional narrative, 'intelligence failure' was framed as the prime narrative. But the thesis is hard to argue when tactical intelligence was delivered exceptionally well, despite reduced resources, and it outlined the threats in detail well before the attack, including the almost exact number anticipated to be abducted. There are too many anomalies and happy coincidences in the current narratives. So, if 'intelligence failure' is not the story, what is? This leaves open the question, was the 'neglect of intelligence evidence' just unprofessional conduct? In the United States, September 11, 2001, provided the kind of catastrophic and catalyzing event – like 'a new Pearl Harbor' – that the leading neoconservatives, gathered around the Project for the New American Century in 2000, envisioned as critical to achieve massive rearmament in America. Subsequently, it served as a flawed pretext for the war against Iraq and global war on terror. Netanyahu was well aware of this neoconservative Project; he funded some of its pioneers. The rise of neoconservatism in the U.S. went hand in hand with the emergence of Netanyahu’s Likud in Israel. It resulted in a neoconservative policy document, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, described as 'a kind of U.S.-Israeli neoconservative manifesto.' In Israel, the Hamas offensive was immediately followed by a coordinated nationwide outcry that 'October 7 is our September 11' by PM Netanyahu, who had built his rise to power in the 1990s in cooperation with the very same U.S. neoconservatives, as well as the rise of Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which his policies had tacitly supported for years. With October 7, he used the Hamas offensive to legitimize the subsequent ground assault and genocidal atrocities, which many in his war cabinet hoped would result in ethnic expulsions that would open Gaza for Jewish resettlement. Meanwhile, his Messianic far-right cabinet partners used the fog of war to disguise their ongoing (and largely successful) effort at the effective annexation of the West Bank to Israel proper. The point is not to argue that one or another of these narratives is conclusive. Too much evidence is still missing. The point is that the current 'facts' feature many anomalies that conventional wisdom shuns, but alternate narratives can explain. Conventional wisdom may be convenient, but it is seldom either persuasive or final. The original commentary was published by Antiwar.com on March 10, 2025. This commentary draws from Dr Dan Steinbock’s new book, The Fall of Israel. a comprehensive historical and contemporary analysis of the how the path to the obliteration of Gaza was paved by the confluence of a set of longstanding forces. It focuses on the transformation of Israel, ethnic cleansing and genocidal atrocities, the Gaza War and regional escalation. It has been endorsed by two former European foreign ministers, the leading US political scientist, Israeli, Palestinian and Iranian scholars of the Middle East, and Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson. 'When you finish the book,' Wilkerson says, 'I hope you will understand that our current national path leads us straight to hell.

'It’s infuriating,' said Desiatnik who served in Nahal Oz, where 20 other women border surveillance soldiers were murdered by Hamas. 'We saw what was happening, we told them about it, and we were the ones who were murdered.' Underpinning all these ignored warnings was the IDF’s assumption that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare to do so. The flawed supposition was fostered by two factors. First, gender bias. The longer the militarization has prevailed in Israel, the more the country’s gender gap –the difference between women and men as reflected in social, political, and economic attainments – has deepened. Today, Israel’s gender gap ranks at the level of El Salvador and Uganda. What, after all, did the 'girls' of the lookout units know? Moreover, the idea that Hamas lacked capability to attack was predicated on the belief the Palestinians were 'human animals,' as Netanyahu and the cabinet ministers called Hamas operatives. Subhumans cannot think out-of-the-box. In reality, based on over 1 year of evidence, Hamas militants had trained for the blitzattacks in at least six sites across Gaza in plain sight and less than 1.5 km from Israel’s heavily fortified and monitored border, as even the mainstream CNN concluded barely a week after October 7. Worse, many testimonies by Israeli witnesses to the Hamas attack indicate that the Israeli military killed its own citizens struggling to neutralize Palestinian gunmen, in accordance with the Hannibal Directive. As one witness said to Israel Radio: '[Israeli special forces] eliminated everyone, including the hostages.' Worse, in addition to the ignored intelligence, there were other issues that just didn’t add up, including the abandoned hostages, and the state of the long neglected Israeli communities surrounding Gaza. Abandoned hostages On October 7, 2023, as part of the overall Hamas-led offense, 251 people were abducted from Israel to the Gaza Strip, including children, women and elderly. Almost half of the hostages were foreign nationals or had multiple citizenships. The next day, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed ex-military commander Gal Hirsch to coordinate the cross-governmental response to abducted civilians and soldiers. Internationally, the appointment was portrayed as the PM’s proactive move to ensure the timely release of the Israeli hostages. Little did they know. As brigadier general, Hirsch had commanded an IDF division during the 2006 Lebanon War, which saw the first test of the Dahiya doctrine, premised on the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Hirsch was seen as responsible for the blunder resulting in an abduction by Hezbollah militants and the battles of Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha’b, which the IDF failed to occupy, despite heavy casualties. Following a barrage of criticism, Hirsch was forced to resign. After years of career rehabilitation, he joined the dominant harsh-right party Likud at the behest of Netanyahu himself and became the favorite for the role of the national police chief in 2021 – until he and his business partners were indicted for tax evasion of $1.9 million in a case concerning arms sales to Georgia. Why did Netanyahu appoint as his hostage tsar a general who had already blundered one high-profile abduction affair, failed to protect his soldiers and had been indicted for corruption? Unsurprisingly, the families of the hostages concluded that, in the view of the Netanyahu government, the fate of the hostages was secondary to the pretext of October 7 for a massive ground assault. The realization led to bitter and divisive mass demonstrations against the government and for the release of the hostages that prevailed until recently. If the hostage families and many ordinary Israelis despised the government that seemed to ignore the fate of the abducted, they found it even harder to digest the idea that their government may have been responsible for the deliberate killing of their loved ones. Just days after October 7, early reports and interviews suggested that the IDF had detailed prior knowledge of the Hamas offensive three long weeks beforehand, based on information from military intelligence’s Unit 8200. Highlighting the extent to which the IDF’s Gaza Division was aware of a potential attack on Israel’s southern border communities, the document, which was ignored by senior officials, detailed a series of exercises conducted by Hamas’ elite Nukhba units in the weeks prior to its publication. One of the most shocking sections of the IDF report featured instructions relating to the taking of hostages, the number of which was estimated to be between 200–250, coming close to the actual 251 captives. Does this enumeration in the report reflect extraordinary foresight? Or does it – since its findings were blatantly ignored prior to October 7 – illustrate a deliberate intention to allow a certain extent of devastation, in order to permit a transformational event that would legitimize a broad-scale invasion and, ultimately, a war of obliteration? Such considerations, of course, have been quickly torpedoed as 'conspiracy theories.' However, as long as credible investigations are deferred or suppressed in advance, legitimate concerns prevail on the causes of devastation on October 7. And then, there was the odd issue of the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, which had been regarded as 'strategic' since the creation of Israel in 1948. Why had they been ignored as if they were 'non-strategic' for several years? Neglected Israeli communities When Israel was established, its founding fathers considered its border areas strategic. Adjacent to the Gaza Strip, these are the populated areas in Israel’s Southern District located within 7 km of the border and thus within the range of mortar shells and Qassam rockets. If these areas were strategic to national security, why were they so vulnerable on October 7? It is one thing that Israeli intelligence ignored over a year of warnings about the ability and willingness of Hamas to launch a major offensive. But it is another that the security of the surrounding Israeli border areas was effectively downplayed. Some of these settlements were created at the eve of the 1948 Arab Israeli War, including Sa’ad and Nirim, the two kibbutzim. The bigger ones were established soon after the 1949 Armistice Agreement, including Sderot, a development town for Mizrahi immigrants – that is, the Jews from the Middle East – and the military Nahal Oz, designed to become a civilian settlement and serve as a first line of defense against possible Arab incursions. In the early days of the Israeli state, many new arrivals from the Arab countries found themselves treated as 'more primitive' second-class citizens by the predominantly European-born Ashkenazi-Jewish elite. These subtle and not-so-subtle ethnic differences, compounded by visible 'white' and 'non-white' distinctions, continue to haunt the Israeli civil society. Yet, the Mizrahi Jews near Gaza faced additional challenges, and there were many Ashkenazis in these communities as well. Many of these localities were neglected, while some, particularly the immigrant development towns, felt shunned by their government. When Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967, border threats diminished until the First Intifada in the late 1980s and the rise of Hamas. Following Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, cross-border shelling and rocket attacks into Israel increased accordingly. To protect these areas, which now became known as the Gaza Envelope, the Israeli parliament Knesset enacted a law to assist the 'confrontation-line communities.' But when these measures expired in 2014 – a decade before October 7 – the district command of the IDF cut the associated budgets. This enraged many of the communities. After all, the 2014 Gaza War had caused a substantial adverse impact on the proximate settlements, due to rocket and mortar attacks, tunnels, intrusions, even incendiary kites. The war was followed by another wave of violence in 2018. And on October 7, many communities in the Gaza Envelope were infiltrated, with hundreds of Israelis butchered and kidnapped. Instead of protecting its citizens, Israel had retreated from its traditional security obligations to the adjacent Israeli communities. As evidenced by the national budget for the Gaza Envelope localities in 2014–2024, these communities were, as critics said, 'slated for abandonment following the November 2022 elections.' In effect, the per capita budgets approved for the years 2023-2024 were almost a third lower than that of 2022. So, well before October 7, the strategic needs of the Gaza Envelope of adjacent Israeli communities were effectively neglected by the government. However, the huge military border barrier prevailed. Between 2017 and 2021, to counter the many tunnels Palestinians dug for infiltration, Israel also constructed an underground border wall, equipped with sensors several meters in depth along the entire border. In Israel, the high-tech security barriers were portrayed as impenetrable. And yet, the IDF was tricked by Hamas’s messaging, over-relied on a remote-controlled surveillance systems and weapons that were swiftly disabled by drones and snipers, enabling its infiltration and onslaught. Furthermore, the builder of the barrier had warned already in 2018 that it absolutely required a military presence. It was not designed to prevent mass assault on its own. Unsurprisingly, the Hamas offensive caused a full breakdown in trust between the Israeli localities and their state, with residents reluctant to return to homes until security was fully ensured. As regional escalation spread to northern Israel, it shared the Gaza Envelope’s challenges, facing the rockets of the Hezbollah. By summer 2024, local leaders were warning the Netanyahu cabinet they planned to leave if the situation wouldn’t improve. 'Where is the government?' asked the chief of the regional council, Moshe Davidovitch. 'Even a banana republic does not work like this,' he added. 'The government is destroying the North.' Convenient narratives and inconvenient truths By May 2024, new evidence indicated that Israel’s intelligence failure was the net effect of a 'chain of failures' that pervaded the entire security sector, both in the Shin Bet and the IDF. The common denominator was the fallacy that Hamas was only able of firing long-range rockets against Israel. Whatever did not fit this theory was rejected. So, the warnings of the IDF female spotters were systematically ignored. What they saw as an impending mass attack intelligence officers dismissed as 'routine Hamas training.' Second, after the Gaza war in 2021, it was decided to cease intelligence-gathering on Hamas’ tactical array and the intermediate ranks of its military arm, to focus only on few individuals. Opposing views to this intelligence concept were marginalized. These failures were coupled with a sense of disdain in the intelligence culture, which viewed the border fence, together with the underground border barrier between Israel and Gaza, as denying Hamas the possibility of invading Israel. The 'Iron Wall' was considered impenetrable; for all the wrong reasons. In effect, Hamas operatives breached the border barrier at 44 different points. Consequently, the so-called intelligence failure on October 7 can be attributed primarily to the rejection of external warnings, denial of internal evidence, suppression of tactical intelligence, autocratic culture, and inflated perception of the effectiveness of the separation barriers. The ongoing investigation of the military is likely to stress similar factors. But was that the full story or a part of the story? In effect, what was the story? In the early conventional narrative, 'intelligence failure' was framed as the prime narrative. But the thesis is hard to argue when tactical intelligence was delivered exceptionally well, despite reduced resources, and it outlined the threats in detail well before the attack, including the almost exact number anticipated to be abducted. There are too many anomalies and happy coincidences in the current narratives. So, if 'intelligence failure' is not the story, what is? This leaves open the question, was the 'neglect of intelligence evidence' just unprofessional conduct? In the United States, September 11, 2001, provided the kind of catastrophic and catalyzing event – like 'a new Pearl Harbor' – that the leading neoconservatives, gathered around the Project for the New American Century in 2000, envisioned as critical to achieve massive rearmament in America. Subsequently, it served as a flawed pretext for the war against Iraq and global war on terror. Netanyahu was well aware of this neoconservative Project; he funded some of its pioneers. The rise of neoconservatism in the U.S. went hand in hand with the emergence of Netanyahu’s Likud in Israel. It resulted in a neoconservative policy document, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, described as 'a kind of U.S.-Israeli neoconservative manifesto.' In Israel, the Hamas offensive was immediately followed by a coordinated nationwide outcry that 'October 7 is our September 11' by PM Netanyahu, who had built his rise to power in the 1990s in cooperation with the very same U.S. neoconservatives, as well as the rise of Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which his policies had tacitly supported for years. With October 7, he used the Hamas offensive to legitimize the subsequent ground assault and genocidal atrocities, which many in his war cabinet hoped would result in ethnic expulsions that would open Gaza for Jewish resettlement. Meanwhile, his Messianic far-right cabinet partners used the fog of war to disguise their ongoing (and largely successful) effort at the effective annexation of the West Bank to Israel proper. The point is not to argue that one or another of these narratives is conclusive. Too much evidence is still missing. The point is that the current 'facts' feature many anomalies that conventional wisdom shuns, but alternate narratives can explain. Conventional wisdom may be convenient, but it is seldom either persuasive or final. The original commentary was published by Antiwar.com on March 10, 2025. This commentary draws from Dr Dan Steinbock’s new book, The Fall of Israel. a comprehensive historical and contemporary analysis of the how the path to the obliteration of Gaza was paved by the confluence of a set of longstanding forces. It focuses on the transformation of Israel, ethnic cleansing and genocidal atrocities, the Gaza War and regional escalation. It has been endorsed by two former European foreign ministers, the leading US political scientist, Israeli, Palestinian and Iranian scholars of the Middle East, and Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson. 'When you finish the book,' Wilkerson says, 'I hope you will understand that our current national path leads us straight to hell.

The Deepening Deterioration Of The Situation In Afghanistan – Ana...	By Zhou Chao Since the United States' hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban quickly overthrew the pro-Western government that had been supported by the U.S. and other Western nations, establishing their own regime. Subsequently, the international community maintained a long-standing stance of non-recognition and isolation towards the Taliban authorities, and the Chinese government also did not officially recognize the Taliban. However, the Chinese government and the Taliban authorities have had considerable practical contact, with China formally accepting the Taliban's appointed ambassador to China, and Chinese companies beginning to reinvest in the Afghan region. In 2023, China's Central Asia Petroleum and Natural Gas Company (CAPEIC) signed an investment agreement with the Afghan authorities totaling USD 540 million. In 2024, China and Afghanistan signed a cooperation agreement for a key supporting project of the Mes Aynak copper mining, the Baghdara hydropower project, with a total investment of USD 10 billion. In the summer of the same year, there was an official announcement on the commencement of the construction of a new road from the Kabul-Gardez intercity highway to the entrance of the Mes Aynak copper mine, marking a significant step forward in the China-invested mine project. Since the Taliban took control of the Afghan government, analyses have consistently pointed out that the internal situation in Afghanistan has not fully stabilized. Internal conflicts in Afghanistan still show signs of resurgence, and the Taliban remains isolated internationally, with economic difficulties also intensifying. However, some Chinese analyses suggest that this situation might actually present an opportunity for China to increase its investment in Afghanistan. Recently, Transparency International, in its 2024 report, stated that Afghanistan ranked 165th out of 180 countries in terms of public sector corruption. According to the report, Afghanistan scored 17 out of 100 on the Corruption Perceptions Index, 3 points lower than its score in 2023. The country had previously scored 20 points in 2023 and 24 points in 2022. Although the Taliban regime's scores have decreased in recent years, it still remains better than the situation under the previous government. In March 2024, the Taliban authority publicly stated that all forms of corruption within government departments had been eradicated and that Afghanistan would welcome foreign investment with efficiency, integrity, and a proactive attitude. Overall, the feasibility of investing in Afghanistan seems to have been strengthened. However, a series of developments in Afghanistan's internal situation since the second half of last year suggest that the possibility of the situation worsening significantly should not be underestimated. For the Taliban regime, its governance is based on Islamic law, with Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada controlling core policies through religious edicts. Military and political leaders are required to obey his decisions. Beneath the Supreme Leader, the Taliban regime is primarily divided into four factions: 1. Kandahar Faction (Akhundzada, etc.): Representing the traditional Pashtun forces, this faction emphasizes religious orthodoxy. 2. Haqqani Network: An independent military-economic group closely linked to cross-border armed organizations. 3. Doha Faction (led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, among others): Advocates for limited openness to gain international recognition, but its influence has significantly weakened in recent years. 4. Local Warlords: Some local commanders have gained more autonomy in areas such as taxation and security, creating centrifugal tendencies against the central Taliban government. Outside the Taliban regime, there are still opposition forces in Afghanistan. The more active ones include ISIS, former Afghan government officials, and opposition armed groups led by former Northern Alliance commanders. Since last year, in terms of Afghanistan's internal political and security situation, the Taliban authorities have primarily faced two major challenges. Firstly, there is a growing trend of internal power struggles within the regime. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid recently stated on social media that there are indeed differences of opinion within the Taliban, but he insisted that these differences would not escalate into violent conflict or open clashes. However, observers have pointed out that serious divisions have already emerged within the Taliban leadership and are continuing to intensify. Several months ago, the Taliban's Interior Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, disappeared after traveling to the UAE, while the Deputy Foreign Minister, Abbas Stanikzai, fled to the UAE after issuing harsh criticisms of the Taliban's senior leadership. Related analyses suggest that Afghanistan's supreme spiritual leader Akhundzada, is continuously consolidating power, strengthening the Kandahar faction's control over Afghanistan's highest authority. Meanwhile, the senior leadership of the Haqqani Network is being increasingly marginalized, leading to intense struggles between the two factions. The internal conflict within the Taliban seems to be intensifying, which could directly exacerbate instability in Afghanistan. A recent commentary in Pakistan's Dawn newspaper even pointed out that there is a risk of the Taliban's highest leader being overthrown. Secondly, the strength and destructive power of opposition forces have increased. The Taliban has made slow progress in establishing an inclusive government and has shown excessive bias toward the Pashtun, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among other ethnic groups in the country. Opposition armed groups have seized this opportunity to gain widespread support from Tajik, Hazara, and other ethnic communities, frequently operating in the northern and central regions of Afghanistan. Among them, the organizations led by Ahmad Massoud, leader of the National Resistance Front (NRF), and Yasin Zia, leader of the Afghanistan Freedom Front (AFF), have been the most active. Previously, the AFF has even launched attacks in Kabul, causing casualties among several Taliban members, demonstrating its strong combat capabilities and a determined spirit of resistance. Meanwhile, the NRF has been steadily expanding its forces in its operational areas, strengthening military training, and enhancing its stance against the Taliban. The resurgence of opposition forces, coupled with the intensification of internal struggles within the Taliban, is likely to accelerate the deterioration of Afghanistan's internal situation. Moreover, negative factors outside the political and security situation are also quite evident. According to a report from the World Bank, Afghanistan's GDP has declined by 26% over the past two years, with the economy continuing to suffer from a recession, high unemployment, and a large portion of the population losing their sources of income, resulting in a dire living situation. In such an economic environment, sectors like infrastructure development, education, and healthcare in Afghanistan have struggled to develop effectively, leading to a worsening quality of life for the people. In terms of international recognition, despite the Taliban authorities actively engaging in diplomatic activities, expanding foreign relations, and increasing interactions with Russia, Turkey, China, and some Gulf countries, they recently held high-level meetings with India and even sent delegations to Japan, the international community's recognition of the Taliban government remains minimal. The Taliban authorities are finding it difficult to secure the necessary aid to improve the internal situation, and a significant portion of the population, in search of a livelihood, either flee abroad or align with armed groups, ultimately creating a vicious cycle. Furthermore, the worsening relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan is also worth noting. Data released by the United Nations shows that the operational capabilities of Pakistan's largest terrorist group, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have significantly increased, severely worsening Pakistan's security situation. The report indicates that between July and December 2024, the TTP launched over 600 terrorist attacks against Pakistan, including attacks originating from Afghan territory. Despite the Taliban's assurances that Afghan territory will not be used for terrorism against any country, the Afghan Taliban continues to provide logistical support, operational space, and financial backing to the TTP, including funding for TTP leadership and establishing new training centers in Afghanistan's Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika provinces. Afghanistan's support for the TTP severely impacts Pakistan's security, further escalating tensions between the two countries. Recently, Pakistani authorities have made it clear that they do not rule out the possibility of fully deporting the millions of Afghan refugees still residing in Pakistan. Should Pakistan take formal action, the influx of millions of refugees would further strain Afghanistan's social resources and exacerbate the country's already volatile situation. Another important point to consider is that, with the deepening deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, it is certain to create a regional spillover effect. Refugees and armed militants are likely to spread to neighboring countries, which would, in turn, have a negative impact on the entire Central Asian region. Final analysis conclusion: Since the Taliban's return to power, the international community generally acknowledges that violence within Afghanistan has decreased. However, existing analyses also point out that the Taliban regime has failed to effectively integrate internal forces, and its relationship with its most important neighbor, Pakistan, continues to deteriorate. Now, with the intensifying infighting within the Taliban leadership, the possibility of a deepening internal crisis in Afghanistan cannot be overlooked. If this trend continues to escalate, the regional spillover effects could be quite significant.

The Nantha Kumar Case Is Destroying The Integrity Of The Malaysia...	Its time to abolish this institutionally corrupt organization When Anwar Ibrahim became prime minister in November 2022, he promised that fighting corruption would be his first priority. The Chief Commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Azam Baki himself said, that approximately 30 percent of government spending is lost through leakage connected with corruption. Although Malaysians at first had high hopes, the further rapid decay and politicization of the MACC since Anwar came to power has created much disappointment. The Nantha Kumar case, now playing out is highlighting the lack of integrity of the MACC, which has openly appeared to have been working in cahoots with the allegedly corrupt parties to entrap an investigative journalist, who has been uncovering their illegal operations. Nantha Kumar is an investigative journalist working for the well-known independent news portal Malaysiakini. Nantha had been uncovering a 'fly' syndicate operating at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and had published a series of articles about a 'Pakistani agent' and immigration officials who have been allegedly falsifying entry and exit stamps of foreign workers, without their physical presence. Nantha cooperated with the state immigration director, and a senior official of the home ministry. Nantha also gave the names of corrupt officials allegedly involved in a medical visa scam to the home ministry Saifuddin Nasution Ismail personally. Nantha was well known within Malaysian government, civil service and media circles as an honest journalist with integrity. As part of his investigation, Nantha met with two Pakistani agents at a restaurant, which was registered under the name of a former high ranking immigration officer, where one of the agents claimed that someone had asked for RM400,000 to settle the case with the police, MACC, immigration department and Malaysiakini. They made an offer to Nantha to pay him RM 50,000 (20,000 on the spot) to stop writing about the subject. Nantha upon reporting the attempted bribe to the immigration officer said, there was no financial transaction evidence to make anything stick. This senior immigration officer asked Nantha to meet with the agents once again to gather evidence as an ‘undercover’ agent. A meeting was arranged at the Concorde Hotel in Shah Alam. Nantha informed the state immigration director, he would meet with the agents and later hand over any evidence to them. At the meeting, one of the 'Pakistani' agents handed Nantha an envelope. However, within seconds, a dozen MACC agents descended upon him. Nantha was then remanded for four days, locked up alone in a cell for 15 hours each day. He slept on a hard floor with no blanket or pillows. Treated sub-humanly as a means of humiliation. Detention aftermath The major question is why was only Nantha arrested and no the 'Pakistani' agents who remain free? This is after Nantha went out of his way to cooperate with authorities. Why had the MACC collaborated with those upon who corrupt activities were alleged? Nantha has been released for a number of days, and unlike other cases, Nantha was never taken to a court and formally charged. It appears the MACC has colluded with criminals, attacked the whistleblower, imprisoned him as a means of torture and humiliation, rather than investigate one of the numerous immigration frauds going on. This action also implicates the immigration department and home ministry. Its yet to be determined as to whether Nantha will actually be charged and given a fair opportunity for a trial. This would provide the correct platform for Nantha to tell the court the names of government officials he had dealt with. Any charges and corresponding trial would provide an opportunity for the public to see how corrupt government law enforcement agencies are, in this case both the immigration department and MACC. The attack on a hard working journalist, leaving the real perpetrators of corruption still running about and operating today, is a travesty of justice and major breach of human rights that one would only expect to see in a lawless land. Its time to abolish the MACC The MACC has long been controversial. Back in 2009, Teoh Beng Hock fell to his death from the MACC building in Shah Alam, where the truth until today has not been allowed to come out. The Teoh case shows that whistleblowers are not even safe within MACC buildings. There is no provision for an ombudsman to look at cases such as Nantha’s. Should there had been an ombudsman overseeing such arrests, whistleblowers might be better protected. What is sure, no matter, what is the outcome of the Mantha Kumar case, the integrity of the MACC has been given another blow. It is clear the MACC is not doing the job it is meant to be doing, allowing senior government officials to break the law freely. What is even more dangerous, is that these same people are only too willing to abuse their power to cover up. Structurally, the MACC is not an independent body. The MACC must have permission from the attorney general, who is also the public prosecutor to prosecute any suspects. This leaves the possibility of political interference wide open in who to investigate and prosecute. This allows the MACC to humiliate people without actually charging them with any crime. The MACC reports to the executive, so its operations are opaque. The MACC advisory board is full of members who are closely connected with the political elite, and thus harbour potential conflicts of interest. The MACC should be considered a failed organization, full of political agendas. The MACC appears to be spending a lot of time in pursuing foes of the current administration, settling old scores, where impartiality is in question. Its time to abolish the MACC, so as to clean out the embedded corruption within it. The MACC could be replaced with a fully independent anti-corruption body with the power to investigate and prosecute alleged offenders free of the interference of the attorney general and executive. An ombudsman is required to protect the interests of those taken into custody, to ensure the MACC is not over-stepping its powers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJC0zIz6vxNFk	2025-03-08T18:52:43-08:00	
China’s Ambitious Economic Roadmap For 2025: Innovation, Consumpt...	China has laid out an ambitious economic roadmap for 2025, signaling its intent to solidify its position as a global powerhouse through strategic fiscal expansion, technological innovation, and policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption. Premier Li Qiang’s government work report, delivered at the opening of the third session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) on March 5, underscores Beijing’s determination to sustain a growth target of around 5%, despite global economic uncertainties. Former United Nations Under-Secretary-General Erik Solheim emphasized China’s role as a stabilizing force in the world economy. 'With an expected economic growth of around 5% for 2025, China will continue to be the biggest source of global economic growth,' he noted in an interview with China Economic Net. This projection underscores Beijing’s confidence in its long-term strategy, even as the global economic order remains in flux. At the heart of this strategy is China’s effort to transition from an export-driven economy to one fueled by domestic consumption and cutting-edge technological advancements. The government work report outlines a proactive fiscal policy, expanding the fiscal deficit target from 3% to 4%, thereby creating additional leverage for investment in key sectors. This shift is designed to enhance economic resilience while ensuring stability amid external pressures. Bernardo Mendia, Board Advisor at the EU Young Entrepreneurs Association, described China’s evolving economic model as a shift from labor-intensive growth to capital- and technology-driven expansion. 'The planned measures to stimulate domestic consumption and the incentives for skill development provide strong endogenous power for long-term growth,' he explained. This transition is further reinforced by China’s move to inject 1.3 trillion yuan in ultra-long special treasury bonds—an increase of 300 billion yuan from last year—while issuing 4.4 trillion yuan in local government special-purpose bonds. China’s commitment to fostering a more open market for investment is another key pillar of its 2025 plan. The government has announced regulatory reforms aimed at expanding access to sectors such as telecoms, medical services, education, and the cultural industries. This move is expected to attract foreign investors by offering greater opportunities for reinvestment and deeper integration into China’s industrial supply chains. David Perez-Des Rosiers, Director of the Canada China Business Council Beijing Chapter, highlighted China’s commitment to an open business environment. 'China’s efforts to expand service sector openness and attract foreign investment offer a positive perspective for Canadian businesses, particularly in services and education, which form a large part of Canada-China bilateral trade,' he noted. A recent business survey revealed that 70% of Canadian companies still consider China a top-five priority for investment, signaling continued confidence in the Chinese market. China’s ambitious 2025 strategy also underscores its focus on innovation, with significant investments in cutting-edge sectors such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied AI, and 6G. The newly launched 'AI Plus' initiative aims to integrate artificial intelligence into manufacturing, further cementing China’s position as a global leader in technological development. Patrick Nijs, co-founder of the EU-China Joint Innovation Center, stressed the importance of collaboration in technological advancements. 'For a successful ecological transition, we need a structured platform for cooperation between Europe and China to address climate change and enhance industrial innovation,' he stated. His remarks reflect growing European recognition of China’s technological leadership and the necessity of avoiding a technological decoupling between global powers. China’s economic roadmap is also deeply intertwined with its commitment to sustainability. Solheim pointed to 'stability' and 'innovation' as the two defining themes of this year’s Two Sessions, emphasizing China’s leadership in both economic and environmental sustainability. 'Europe will realize that we need Chinese technology,' he remarked, underscoring the growing interdependence between global economies. The government’s plans also include a strong focus on employment and social welfare. In 2025, China aims to create over 12 million new urban jobs while keeping the surveyed urban unemployment rate around 5.5%. With every percentage point of GDP growth generating approximately 2.4 million jobs, this target appears well within reach. Additionally, efforts to promote free preschool education and introduce policies to boost birth rates further demonstrate China’s commitment to long-term demographic stability. In the international sphere, China is reinforcing its high-standard opening-up strategy by stabilizing foreign trade, encouraging foreign investment, and advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. Hong Kong's deputy to the NPC, Ronick Chan Chun-ying, expressed confidence in Beijing’s ability to sustain its growth trajectory. 'China has consistently sustained medium-to-high-speed economic growth, and its ability to maintain a 5% growth rate demonstrates the country’s confidence, which in turn strengthens global investor confidence,' he stated. China’s economic plan for 2025 represents a strategic pivot towards innovation-driven growth, increased domestic consumption, and financial stability. At a time of increasing global uncertainty, Beijing is sending a clear message: its long-term ambitions remain firmly intact, and it intends to achieve them through a calculated blend of fiscal expansion, technological leadership, and global cooperation. As the world watches China’s next moves, one thing remains clear—its trajectory will continue to shape the global economic landscape for years to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJD8NOjERTJH6	2025-03-08T18:51:04-08:00	
Worrying Echoes Of The Past In The Balkans – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, trade wars between America’s friends and foes — there has been no shortage of crises around the world. At times, it feels like several months’ worth of geopolitical events have taken place in just the past week alone. But another potential conflict that is not getting much attention can be found in southeastern Europe in the Balkan country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina emerged from the aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, followed by a very bloody inter-religious and inter-ethnic sectarian war. The Bosnian Muslim community was targeted mainly by the ethnic Serbian community. In 1995, a historic peace deal was signed in Dayton, Ohio, known now as the Dayton Peace Agreement. This resulted in Bosnia and Herzegovina being formed by two sub-state entities. One was the ethnically Bosnian and Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the other was the ethnically Serb Republika Srpska. The current leader of the latter, Milorad Dodik, has long been an advocate for independence from the rest of Bosnia. He does this with rhetoric but also with actions. In recent years, he has taken steps to undermine the legitimate state structures and institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and has started the process of creating parallel state institutions inside Republika Srpska. Dodik has long pursued independence for Republika Srpska and has actively worked to weaken the state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The situation took a dramatic turn in January this year, when Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office for six years after refusing to comply with recommendations from the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt. Even though Dodik was obligated to do so under the terms of the 1995 Dayton Agreement, he refused. If this was not enough to start a political crisis in Bosnia, this week Dodik signed into law legislation from the Republika Srpska parliament that banned Bosnia and Herzegovina’s police force and judiciary from operating inside Republika Srpska. This was viewed by many as an affront not only to Bosnia’s sovereignty but also to the Dayton Agreement, which has been the key factor in keeping the country at peace and together. Along the way, he is encouraged by his neighbor, Serbia, and also, by extension, Russia. The situation in Bosnia is made worse by developments in neighboring Serbia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has a close and supportive relationship with Dodik, is experiencing his own political difficulties. Since November 2024, when a roof at a train station collapsed, killing 15 people, he has faced mounting anti-government street protests. These demonstrations have expanded into a broader movement against corruption, culminating in dramatic scenes this week, when opposition MPs set off smoke bombs and flares inside the Serbian parliament. Three lawmakers were injured in the chaos. Vucic is trying to find a way to solve his own domestic political challenges, and encouraging a crisis in Republika Srpska to divert attention might be seen as a solution to his problems. There are numerous examples throughout history where geopolitical circumstances that seem to be regional or even local can have a global impact. The Balkans before the First World War is a great example. There is reason to worry that the region could serve as another flashpoint for a greater conflict, especially as relations between major global powers appear to be strained. As Russia continues to ramp up the pressure over Ukraine and apply more pressure on Europeans, it could well use its influence in Serbia and Republika Srpska to cause a diversion that Europe will have to address. If ever there was a 'European problem,' then what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina is certainly one. It is highly unlikely that US President Donald Trump will repeat America’s response to a crisis in the region in the 1990s, when thousands of US troops were deployed as peacekeepers inside Bosnia to stop the killing, or when the US Air Force was used in 1999 to prevent genocide by Serbia against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The Trump White House is focused on dealing with Russia, Ukraine, China, and Iran, along with the situation at America’s southern border. There will likely be little bandwidth to address the situation in southeast Europe. This week, Russia called for a closed-door UN Security Council meeting to discuss the political situation in Bosnia. It will be interesting to see how the US sides in this meeting. Will there be a repeat of the US siding with Russia at the recent UN General Assembly vote over Ukraine, or will the US stick to its more traditional position of supporting the Dayton Peace Agreement and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina? Russia may even try to use this issue as a bargaining chip in the bigger issue of peace negotiations over Ukraine. With Europe focused on what it will do about Ukraine in the event that there is a ceasefire, there is likely to be little capacity for any meaningful European response if war breaks out in the Balkans. While events in the Balkans may not be on the minds of Europeans, events in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region are certainly on the minds of the local leaders. Therefore, it would be incumbent on American and European policymakers not to ignore the region and to stay committed to the hard-fought peace won in the 1990s. Even with everything going on around the world, from Eastern Europe to the Middle East to East Asia, policymakers must keep a close eye on the Balkans. The international community must remain vigilant and committed to preventing the kind of instability that led to war in the 1990s. As history has shown, tensions in the Balkans have the potential to ignite wider conflicts if left unchecked. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Greenland Elections: Go American, Stay Danish, Or Go It Alone? – ...	By Rikard Jozwiak (RFE/RL) -- Normally the elections for the 31-member Inatsisartut, the parliament of Greenland, would get scant attention. The world's biggest island, with a population of just 60,000, is rarely in the news. That changed in January, when incoming US President Donald Trump expressed an interest in taking control of the strategically located and resource-rich territory. The move sent shockwaves throughout Europe, notably for fellow NATO ally Denmark, to which Greenland in fact belongs. (While Copenhagen oversees foreign and monetary policy, Greenlanders control most domestic issues.) That has meant all eyes will now be on the March 11 elections, called by Greenland's prime minister, Mute Egede, after Trump's pronouncements. And while regular domestic issues are part of the election campaign, the overriding issue is clear: Go American, stay Danish, or aim for independence? To be clear, most Greenlanders don't want to become American, and none of the five parties in parliament is advocating for it. Along with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Egede has made clear that Greenland -- which is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark -- is not for sale and that only Greenlanders can decide its future. Interestingly, the parliament recently passed a law banning both anonymous and foreign donations in the election campaign. But what if an offer they can't refuse comes their way? The United States first expressed an interest in the island in the 19th century, and the territory is actually closer to North America than the European continent. Greenland's security is already guaranteed by virtue of an US air base in the north. And the Arctic is certainly not off-limits for the major powers. Both China and Russia are active in the region, not only for the region's lucrative rare earth materials but also due to warmer temperatures melting sea ice and opening up lucrative trade routes. Even if the island doesn't become American anytime soon, there could be some sort of free trade or association deal with Washington in the future. Then again, the Greenlanders can be a conservative bunch. Where others may see lucrative business opportunities, many of them see a homeland that should be preserved. Only two mines currently exist in Greenland, and the last election, in 2021, was dominated by the popular decision to limit oil and gas exploration and ban the mining of uranium. It is here where Denmark comes into the picture. Three of the five political parties want independence from Denmark, including Prime Minister Egede's left-wing Community of the People party, which finished first four years ago and is likely to finish on top again. The same is true for the ruling party's current coalition partner, the social-democrat Forward party, which aims to finish second. The liberal Democrats party, which prefers to remain in a union with Denmark, is also doing well in recent polls and could well complicate any coalition-building and the direction Greenland will eventually take. While most Greenlanders say they want independence, they also want to maintain their living standards. For that the territory is largely dependent on Denmark. Loyal to the Danish crown since 1814, 50 percent of Greenland's exports go to Denmark and 60 percent of its imports are from Denmark. Half of the population works in the public sector, which Copenhagen to a large degree finances via grants. And to boost security across the island, the Danish government last month pledged 2 billion euros ($2.16 billion) to improve its Arctic defenses. There is a commission in Greenland working on what a possible divorce from Denmark would look like, but essentially it would require three steps. Firstly, there would have to be a deal with Copenhagen on what separation would look like; secondly, there would have to be a positive result in a Greenland-wide referendum on independence; and finally, the Danish parliament would need to green-light the whole endeavor. The pro-independence parties want a referendum to take place sometime during the next four-year mandate, but, given the uncertainties surrounding the territory, that certainly doesn't look like it will happen in 2025.

Ron Paul: Yes, You Can Protect Liberty And Security At The Same T...	When I served in Congress, I was regularly lectured about how the people needed big government to keep them safe and secure, whether it was through welfare and regulations to ensure their economic security, the Patriot Act to protect their personal security, or forever wars to protect global security. Of course, the government’s track record when it comes to providing economic, personal, and global security proves that Ben Franklin was right, and my fellow representatives were wrong, about the dangers of trading liberty for security. The best example of this is the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The TSA is very good at treating law-abiding airline passengers as criminal suspects—but not so good at catching real threats to passenger safety. According to the polling company YouGov, 'Homeland Security conducted an investigation in 2015 which found that undercover investigators were able to successfully smuggle mock explosives and banned weapons through TSA checkpoints in 95% of trials.' Responsibility for passenger security should be given to airlines who have an incentive to provide effective security that does not violate their passengers’ privacy and dignity. Private security companies would compete for the airlines’ business. These private companies would prove far more effective at providing safety than a federal bureaucracy like the TSA. This is because the TSA, like all government bureaucracies, is immune from market competition and thus market discipline. This means they have no incentive to improve their operations. In fact, while failures to stop future attacks would cause a private security company to lose business, government services often get their budgets increased when they fail, whilst the federal employees and agency heads are rarely held accountable for their mistakes. The TSA’s monopoly on airline security also prevents the development of innovative ways to ensure safety. While the TSA does not appear to be going anywhere anytime soon, my son, US Senator from Kentucky Rand Paul, recently helped to protect free markets with another national security matter—the National Public Warning System and Emergency Alert System, which are used to provide emergency alerts. He did this by drastically improving a bill known as the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. Police groups, attorneys general, and other public safety leaders have stated that AM radio is currently the only communications signal with enough reliability during storms and other emergencies to power the National Public Warning System and Emergency Alert System. Fair enough. I recall during Hurricane Harvey, many of my fellow Texans had no other way of accessing this system as their cellphones and Internet remained out for days. But the problem with the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act in its 2023–2024 form was that, with no sunset provision, it would have frozen today’s AM-reliant system in place, disincentivizing private companies from ever developing newer, innovative ways to effectively deliver emergency alerts over new technologies in the future. Rand blocked the bill in 2023. As he often does, Rand took a principled stand for liberty. Now, Rand’s efforts have paid off as, to prevent the bill from being blocked again, longtime supporters of the legislation added a sunset provision to the AM radio bill when they recently reintroduced the legislation for consideration this year. The sunset provision offers incentives to entrepreneurs to develop new ways to ensure all Americans have access to emergency alerts. The sunset provision makes it a vast improvement over the prior legislation. It’s evidence that even Congress can be convinced to better respect classical liberal principles from time to time, and that’s great news all around.

Protests And Strikes In Iran: Growing Public Outrage Against Corr...	On March 8, Iran witnessed a new wave of strikes and protests in multiple cities, as workers from various sectors took to the streets to express their anger over deteriorating living conditions, widespread corruption, and the authorities’ failure to respond to their demands. These protests included employees of the Telecommunications Company of Iran, healthcare workers, truck drivers, farmers, and oil sector employees, reflecting the widespread dissatisfaction with the Iranian regime. Strikes in the telecommunications sector Several provinces in Iran, including Khorasan Razavi, experienced widespread strikes by employees of the Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI). In Mashhad, workers protested against unpaid wages, the flawed implementation of the job classification system, and the continued presence of intermediary companies that exploit their rights without providing adequate guarantees. Protests in the healthcare sector In East Azerbaijan Province, in the city of Tabriz, the surgical staff at Imam Reza Hospital went on strike, refusing to perform surgeries in protest against the authorities’ neglect of their demands. Healthcare workers have long complained about deteriorating working conditions, low wages, and lack of government support. In northern Iran, in the city of Bandar Anzali, nurses and staff at Beheshti Hospital also went on strike, demanding the payment of their overdue salaries and Nowruz bonuses, which the government has yet to pay. This reflects the ongoing neglect of healthcare workers by the regime. Demonstrations and protests in other sectors Protests extended to other parts of the country as well. At the Turkish border, truck drivers gathered to denounce corruption in the industry and mining sector and demanded the release of their trucks, which had been unlawfully seized by authorities. In Isfahan, farmers staged a protest against the government’s failure to fulfill its promises, particularly regarding the provision of water for agriculture and compensation for their losses due to the regime’s failed agricultural policies. In the oil sector, employees who had passed the 2013 employment examination staged a protest in Ahvaz, denouncing the systemic discrimination and marginalization they face from government officials. Implications of protests These strikes and protests highlight the growing public outrage against the Iranian regime’s policies, which continue to ignore citizens’ demands and fail to provide even the most basic living conditions. The persistence and expansion of these protests indicate that Iran’s economic and political crisis is worsening. While the regime remains focused on its regional interventions instead of addressing domestic hardships, the question remains: Will the Iranian regime reverse its oppressive policies, or is the country heading toward greater escalation?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJF9R-LfGYFIe	2025-03-08T18:40:05-08:00	
Starmer Is Ditching Zelensky To Avoid Trump Tariffs And Land A Tr...	Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to Washington majored on an historic invitation for President Trump to make a second state visit to Britain. Despite considerable pre-visit hype among the UK mainstream media, Ukraine was barely mentioned. The cold truth is, Starmer is ditching Zelensky to avoid tariffs. The subtle art of diplomacy is often hard to fathom for the outsider. When Keir Starmer called on Donald Trump in the Oval Office on 27 February, there was an air of conviviality that belied what some considered to have been, hitherto, a difficult relationship. The set piece moment was the Prime Minster handing the President a letter from His Majesty, King Charles II. While it has attracted little comment, The King’s letter to President Trump was a diplomatic masterstroke. A section of the first page was captured by a photographer. These were words crafted by His Majesty himself, with his distinct syntax, rather than written by an anonymous committee of officials in 10 Down Street. The preambular second paragraph appears to contain mere niceties about a possible Trump visit to Scotland, but it was so much more. Donald Trump’s mother was born in Scotland, and the President famously owns golf courses there. The King extends a deeply personal invitation for the President to stay at Balmoral, the favoured Residence in Scotland of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and the place she passed. There is also an offer to visit and stay at Dumfries House, which was His Majesty’s seat in Scotland before ascending to the throne, when his Royal title in Scotland was the Duke of Rothesay. He mentions that underprivileged young people are trained at the House and many end up working at the President’s golfing establishments. Scotland holds a special place in the hearts of both Heads of State. And Diplomacy, ultimately, is about human connection. This was King Charles addressing President Trump as an equal, a peer and a cherished friend. And then the coup de grace, an invitation to an historic second State visit, historic because no US President has been afforded two State visits. President Trump appears to value the form of diplomacy at least as much as its substance. The style and class of King Charles’ letter sits in stark contrast, to the truculent, unshaven President Zelensky arguing in the Oval Office on 28 February. And the theatre behind Keir Starmer’s handing the letter to President Trump was designed to reinforce two perceptions. The first was that The King continues to regard the United States as a dear and trusted friend. The second, and perhaps more significantly, that Prime Minister Starmer was the messenger, not the peer. Some British journalists jokingly referred to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday 27 February as a visit to the King. Clearly, President Trump isn’t a monarch, nor is he Elvis Presley. But in the game of diplomacy between the United States and the United Kingdom, His Majesty King Charles II and President Trump are peers as Heads of State, and Prime Minister Starmer is a more junior Head of Government. While the first sentence of the letter is not fully visible, His Majesty is clearly thanking President Trump for receiving the British Prime Minister – i.e. His Head of Government – so soon after the inauguration. I don’t believe the optics of this would have been lost on the President. The Labour Prime Minister’s has had a bad start with Donald Trump. The King’s letter brings the adults back into the conversation in a way that can only help the UK repair some of the damage caused. In inviting President Trump to Britain, with all the pomp and ceremony that Britain offers like no other country, the UK government wants to reprioritise its trade and investment relationship with the United States. As Europe and America teeter on the brink of a trade war, Britain wants a genuinely open trading relationship with America that both prevents the risk of US tariffs but also gives the UK economy a much-needed boost post-Brexit. America is Britain’s largest export partner accounting for 15.7% of business and trade in goods is fairly balanced, with a tiny surplus of £2.5bn going Britain’s way in 2023. This may help to explain why Britain appears less in the firing line for US tariffs than the European Union, which President Trump said was designed to ‘screw the US’ flooding America with a surplus of $300bn in goods trade. After President Obama famously said that Britain would have to join the back of the queue in any post-Brexit trade talks with America, UK-US trade talks were not prioritised under the Biden administration. This has now become a top priority for the UK in its relationship with the Trump administration. And Starmer has recognised that he can’t have it all – he can’t criticise Trump on Ukraine, backing Zelensky and steering Europe on a pro-war course, while at the same time landing a lucrative trade deal and avoiding Trump tariffs. He has therefore decided quietly to ditch Zelensky and to line up behind Trump’s plans for a peace deal. After Zelensky’s catastrophic Oval Office meeting on 28 February, 10 Downing Street issued a statement saying the Prime Minister had spoken to both US and Ukrainian Presidents. But while it expressed Britain’s ‘unwavering support for Ukraine’, it did not go so far as to side with President Zelensky over the dispute. Having travelled to Washington seeking to avoid causing offence to the President, the stakes are too high for Starmer now to leap onto the bandwagon of unquestioning Zelensky support. Indeed, Starmer is now positioning himself as the bridge between Europe and the US, and has indicated that, with President Macron, he will develop ideas for peace in Ukraine to put to President Trump. This represents a significant shift in UK position, recognising US leadership in landing a peace deal, rather than corralling the European wagons against a change in policy. His Lancaster House Summit of EU Leaders on 2 March, which Zelensky attended, was a long-overdue sign of the UK providing some thought leadership on Ukraine policy. At the very least, it suggests that the UK recognises the greater benefit of delivering strengthened trading relationship with America, rather than clinging on to a losing war in Ukraine. The Brits finally appear to be getting realistic.

With Hezbollah’s Influence Eroded, Can Lebanon Forge A Brighter F...	By Nadia Alfaour For the first time since its creation in 1982, Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia has seen its political and military clout diminished after a devastating war with Israel gutted its leadership, emptied its coffers, and depleted its once formidable arsenal. Despite the grand funeral of its slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah, attended by thousands of mourners at Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Stadium on Feb. 23 to project an image of resilience and strength, the group’s influence over Lebanon and the wider region is undoubtedly on the wane. 'The Lebanese are certainly ready for a new period in the country where the state has a monopoly over weapons,' Michael Young, a senior editor at the Beirut-based Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, told Arab News. 'As for Hezbollah, it is not going to disappear, on the contrary, it is still around. The big question is whether it can transform itself or not.' The fall of the Bashar Assad regime in neighboring Syria — once a critical supply line for weapons from Iran — has compounded Hezbollah’s woes, leaving it isolated, unable to rearm, and increasingly powerless to dictate Lebanese affairs. Hezbollah is reportedly facing a financial crisis, leaving it scrambling to provide monetary support to the families of its injured members and to finance reconstruction work in its southern and eastern strongholds devastated by Israeli bombardment. 'Some Hezbollah supporters have embraced the change while others are still screaming,' a waiter at one of the cafes along Beirut’s Hamra Street who did not wanted to be identified told Arab News. 'If we have to drag them into this new era kicking and screaming, then we will. It has been about them for so many decades. They left the country broken and darkened. It’s time to move on.' Many Lebanese have warmly welcomed the end of Iranian hegemony and the crippling of its biggest proxy in the Middle East. The election of former army chief Joseph Aoun as president and ICJ judge Nawaf Salam as prime minister in January is emblematic of this shift. Backed by the US, France, and Saudi Arabia, Aoun’s election by Lebanese lawmakers is the clearest indication yet that Iran’s influence in Lebanon is spent, opening the way to reforms and international support to help pull the nation out of the mire. Aoun’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia — the first by a Lebanese leader in eight years — has been regarded as a positive step in resetting ties between the two countries. During the visit, Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman promised to reactivate a $3 billion funding package for the Lebanese army, and a released joint statement declared both sides are looking into ways to allow Saudi citizens to visit Lebanon again. Both countries are also looking into the resumption of Lebanese imports into the Kingdom, which had been halted due to the smuggling of millions of amphetamine and Captagon pills into the Arab Gulf states via Lebanon, often hidden in regular cargo. To be sure, not everyone in Lebanon is pleased with the dramatic political shift taking place. Hezbollah supporters have been left reeling since the loss of their charismatic leader and the forced acceptance of the US-brokered ceasefire with Israel, which has been interpreted as a major blow to the 'Axis of Resistance' of Iran-backed proxies throughout the region. 'The Shiite community in Lebanon had their golden days under Nasrallah, and now it’s a new phase where they’re mourning the golden days,' Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said in an interview with an Israeli TV channel. Ghaddar, who is originally from southern Lebanon, said that Hezbollah called for a mass demonstration in downtown Beirut on March 8, 2005, to 'ascertain that they’re taking over, inheriting the Syrian army and taking over the Lebanese institutions.' The war between Israel and the Lebanese militia began on Oct. 8, 2023, when fighters in south Lebanon began firing rockets into northern Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which a day earlier had attacked southern Israel, triggering the war in Gaza. What began as a tit-for-tat exchange of fire along the Israel-Lebanon border suddenly escalated in September 2024 when Israel intensified its aerial bombardment of Hezbollah positions, attacked its communications networks, and mounted a ground offensive. On Sept. 17-18, thousands of pagers and hundreds of walkie-talkies in the possession of Hezbollah members suddenly exploded in synchronized waves after being sabotaged by Israel. The attack killed 42 and injured 3,500, crippling the militia’s communications. According to one of Nasrallah’s sons, Jawad, his father was left spiritually broken by the pager and walkie-talkie attack and the death of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander and long-time Hezbollah member, in an Israeli strike. In an interview with Lebanese television network Al-Manar, Jawad described his father as 'spiritless and sad' after these blows. 'You could see that he was hurt,' he said. 'There were times I could not bear to hear his voice when he was in that state. You listen to him trying to seek encouragement, but once you hear his voice, it hurts your heart. Later, I learned that he was crying.' On Sept. 27, 2024, Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on an underground Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburb. The attack, carried out by Israeli F-15I fighter jets, involved more than 80 bombs, destroying the bunker and nearby buildings. The Israel military confirmed Nasrallah’s death on Sept. 28, and his body was recovered the following day. The strike resulted in at least 33 deaths and nearly 200 injuries, including civilians. As the conflict threatened to drag the US and Iran into direct confrontation, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Israel trading missile strikes, the international community acted to secure a ceasefire in November 2024, which has by and large held. Hezbollah’s battering by Israel has left it politically enfeebled, allowing independent lawmakers and parties not affiliated with the militia to establish a new government after more than two years of political deadlock. 'Up to now there are no signs that the party is going through a reassessment of its previous strategy, although some say within the party such discussions are taking place,' Carnegie Middle East Center’s Young told Arab News. 'Given the hardening of the Iranian position recently, with Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying there can be no negotiations with America, I am not sure that is correct.' Lebanon remains in the midst of a devastating economic crisis, with the local currency having lost more than 90 percent of its value since 2019 and up to 80 percent of the population living in poverty — at least 40 percent of them in extreme poverty. Unemployment rates have skyrocketed and banks continue to impose strict controls on withdrawals and transfers. Meanwhile, the World Bank estimates it will cost $8.5 billion to repair the damage of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. For the thousands of Lebanese who were forced to flee their homes in the south under Israel’s bombardment, the mere suggestion that Hezbollah was somehow victorious in the conflict, as some hardline supporters like to claim, is utterly delusional. 'If my parents return to their village, when should we expect them to be expelled again?' Ali, a university student who now lives with his parents in a cramped Beirut apartment and did not want to give his full name, told Arab News. 'How many more times? We are caught in the crossfire, doomed to be a football between Hezbollah and Israel. 'We are tired of being kicked around. It is shameful. Then you get a deluded supporter who tells you we’ve won. What did we win?' The international community and Arab donors have so far refused to release any aid funds until UN Security Council Resolution 1701 is fully implemented, which calls for the disarmament and disbanding of all armed groups in the country except for the Lebanese army. After several years of political gridlock and a power vacuum once filled by Hezbollah and the Amal bloc led by Nabih Berri, Lebanon is now in a unique position to stabilize and integrate itself once again into the Arab fold. President Aoun’s remarks during the Arab League summit in Cairo on March 4 reflect his apparent determination to set Lebanon on this new course, with some describing his speech as 'resistance through diplomacy.' The Washington Institute’s Ghaddar believes that while the current phase may not be 'the end of Hezbollah for the (Lebanese Shiite) community,' the lack of money, jobs, services, and reconstruction has led people to seek alternatives. 'It’s very clear that Hezbollah is no longer an option for them,' she said in the interview with the Israeli TV channel. Today, 'Hezbollah is a new entity, which cannot provide, cannot protect, obviously cannot preserve, and cannot rebuild.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJGeAz6S70lLV	2025-03-08T18:32:56-08:00	
The Thai Way To End Human-Elephant Conflict – Analysis	Sri Lanka could adopt Thailand's Bajrasudha Gajamurak model, which effectively balances the needs of both elephants and humans through a unique blend of traditional and modern techniques. The human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka continues unabated. Although efforts by successive governments since the 1970s have reduced the rate of attrition, the issue remains a pressing concern. Various mitigation methods have been attempted with mixed success. Given this, it may be worthwhile for the Sri Lankan government to consider adopting Thailand's Bajrasudha Gajamurak model, which successfully integrates traditional and modern strategies to harmonize human-elephant coexistence. The Significance of the Asian Elephant The Asian elephant inhabits diverse ecosystems, ranging from dry to wet forests and grasslands across 13 countries in South and Southeast Asia. While their preferred diet consists of forage plants, they have adapted to consuming a wide variety of resources depending on habitat availability. Historically, human societies in these regions have had a close association with elephants. In the past, elephants were revered rather than seen as adversaries. Even today, they hold a sacred place in religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, despite being viewed as a menace by modern villagers due to their frequent raids for food. Elephants in Hinduism and Buddhism According to Hindu mythology, the gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras or Yakshas) churned the ocean in search of the elixir of life, during which nine sacred jewels emerged—one of them being the elephant. This divine origin made the elephant a symbol of good fortune in Hinduism. The elephant-headed deity Ganesha is venerated as the remover of obstacles. In South India, before entering temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, devotees first pay homage to Ganesha. Similarly, in North Central Sri Lanka, villagers install Ganesha statues to ward off wild elephants. In both South India and Sri Lanka, elaborately decorated elephants are central to religious processions. Records of the use of elephants in Sri Lankan Buddhist rituals date back to the 3rd century BCE. Historical sources even mention the donation of elephants to temples, with the earliest recorded instance occurring in the 1st century CE. Prior to the advent of cavalry warfare, elephants were a vital asset in battles, and Sri Lanka engaged in a thriving trade of elephants with India. Despite this historical reverence, human-elephant relations have deteriorated over time. The exponential growth of the human population and encroachment on elephant habitats have intensified conflicts. However, poaching in Sri Lanka remains relatively low since only 5% of its elephants are tuskers. Rising Conflict and Slaughter Sri Lanka's Minister of Environment, Dammika Patabendi, recently reported alarming statistics in Parliament. Between 2015 and 2019, 1,466 wild elephants were killed. This number increased to 2,011 between 2020 and 2024. Human casualties also rose sharply. Between 2015 and 2019, 456 people were killed due to elephant encounters. The figure surged to 734 between 2020 and 2024. In total, Sri Lanka lost 3,477 wild elephants and 1,190 human lives from 2015 to 2024. To combat this crisis, the Sri Lankan government has implemented several measures, including: Constructing electric fences Reopening blocked elephant corridors Increasing food availability in elephant habitats Establishing wildlife reserves Deploying security task forces to deter elephant incursions into human settlements Developing regulated tourism However, these efforts require stronger enforcement, greater investment, and more strategic planning. Thailand's Effective Approach to Human-Elephant Conflict Thailand, often called the 'Land of the White Elephant,' has a long-standing cultural reverence for elephants. However, the country has faced a severe human-elephant conflict due to habitat destruction and rapid urban expansion. The issue escalated to hundreds of deaths annually among both humans and elephants. Recognizing the urgency, Thailand launched the Bajrasudha Gajamurak Project in 2019, initiated by the Thai royal family. This project, implemented in five eastern provinces—Chachoengsao, Chonburi, Rayong, Chanthaburi, and Sa Kaeo—focuses on creating a sustainable balance where both humans and elephants can coexist. Three-Zone Strategy The project strategically divides areas bordering forests into three distinct zones: Forest Conservation Zone – A designated area where elephants can thrive naturally with sufficient food and water. Buffer Zone – A transition area with food sources and artificial water bodies that prevent elephants from venturing into human settlements. Community Zone – Exclusively for human habitation, with strategies to deter elephant encroachment and promote coexistence. Forest Conservation Zone To encourage elephants to remain within their natural habitat, the project: Established 60 water sources with a combined capacity of 1.8 million cubic meters. Undertook reforestation efforts to restore natural food sources. Planted bamboo, mango, and banana trees, ensuring a sustainable food supply for elephants. Buffer Zone Buffer zones act as temporary dwellings for elephants before they are guided back to conservation areas. Key measures include: Constructing grassy meadows and check dams to ensure consistent water availability. Introducing strongly scented plants, such as climbing wattle and cassia, which elephants avoid. Establishing community forests with medicinal plants to benefit both villagers and wildlife. Use of Artificial Intelligence A Comprehensive Elephant Surveillance System equipped with AI-powered automated cameras was implemented. These cameras, installed in buffer zones, detect elephant movements and send real-time alerts via the LINE chat app to villagers and trained volunteer teams, who then guide the elephants back to their habitats. Community Zones In the community zones, local populations received: Awareness training on elephant behavior and conflict mitigation. Skill development programs to diversify livelihoods. Financial support for alternative income sources, such as medicinal herb cultivation, basket weaving, and food processing. As a result, communities transitioned from single-crop farming to multiple cropping systems, reducing dependence on land encroachment. The project fostered solidarity among villagers, strengthening communal efforts toward sustainable coexistence. Conclusion: A Model for Sri Lanka? The Bajrasudha Gajamurak model provides an effective, structured, and sustainable solution to human-elephant conflict. Sri Lanka, facing a worsening crisis, could benefit immensely from trialing a similar approach, particularly in conflict-prone areas. Implementing Thailand's zoning strategy, AI-based surveillance, and community-driven conservation could pave the way for a more harmonious coexistence between humans and elephants.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJJs92If7RKzr	2025-03-08T18:29:17-08:00	
The Return Of Geopolitics Vs. ‘America First’: Europe’s Strategic...	1. Introduction The slogan 'America First' used by the Trump administration and continued in various forms by American policy, has brought about a strong return to traditional geopolitics. This change has had and is expected to have a series of consequences for Europe. These consequences will be reflected first and foremost in the weakening of multilateralism and, above all, of NATO. This strategy, gradually but with accelerated steps, has already given signs that it is in full compliance with the project for a New World Order that is based on an equally new trajectory, which has nothing to do with the conventional trajectory of American foreign policy. His administration’s approach towards Russia, demonstrated on the third anniversary of the start of the all-out Russian war for the complete annexation of Ukraine, in the UN General Assembly [1] in relation to the resolution sponsored by Ukraine’s allies, which demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from sovereign Ukrainian territory, marks the first step towards the New World Order. The US vote in this case, aligned with Russia, was the clearest sign of the historical turning point in geopolitical realignment. All this is done by counting Russia's withdrawal from the alliance with the rising China. In this process of voting on the resolution, 93 votes were in favor, while 18 were against - among those who voted against were the US!!! With this act, the Transatlantic Alliance was severely hit... but the New World Order also took its first step. This new American course raises legitimate critical questions regarding its consequences, especially for the transatlantic alliance and global stability. The Western Hemisphere thus suffers the greatest rift in its history. What Milosevic had not achieved, despite having resisted NATO bombing for 78 days [1999], after three years of war in Ukraine, Putin achieved. 2. Strategic approach to separating Russia from China – wrong investment The US strategy to separate Russia and China has some parallels with the EU’s strategy to separate Serbia from Russian influence, despite the fact that they seem at first glance to have fundamental differences. In both cases, we are dealing with attempts to separate alliances that were and are perceived to be dangerous to Western interests. However, there are factors that make each case unique. The US strategic approach to China and Russia, like the EU’s approach to Serbia, aims to offer economic, political and diplomatic alternatives to mitigate dependence on Moscow. In this regard, both the US and the EU use economic and diplomatic means to achieve their goals, whether through investments, trade agreements, or integration into international organizations. In both cases, Russia is a key factor that does not easily accept the loss of its allies and reacts with political, economic and military pressure. In this parallel, however, there are also profound differences. Russia and China, despite their strong partnership, have historical differences and interests that do not always coincide. Serbia, on the other hand, has a deeper emotional and historical connection to Russia, which makes it more difficult for it to break away from Moscow. The EU has promised Serbia membership, but the process has been slow and often disappointing. Meanwhile, the US has difficulty detaching China from Russia because Moscow and Beijing see the West as a common threat. Russia and China are both major superpowers and can more easily resist American pressure. In the case of Russia, this resistance was clearly reflected in the three-year war in Ukraine and the insistence on not giving up on the strategic objective of creating the Russian World. Meanwhile, Serbia, although with strong ties to Russia, is more dependent on the EU economically and politically. Therefore, this investment, in both cases, seems to be wrong. In the case of the US, the attempt to separate Russia from China is very difficult and unlikely to succeed in the short term. Both countries have a strategic interest in confronting the West together. Meanwhile, in the case of the EU and Serbia, the EU's attempt to attract Serbia seemed more realistic at first glance, but the stagnation of the accession process and Brussels' hesitation, not only in relation to Serbia, but to all the countries in the region aspiring to EU accession, have made success uncertain. In both cases, the strategy turns out to be wrong. Trump’s approach to Russia is reminiscent of President Richard Nixon’s 1972 China Overture, in which Washington exploited the Sino-Soviet divide to contain Moscow. This time, however, the roles are reversed, as the United States seeks to engage Russia in an effort to weaken China’s strategic position. The administration envisions diplomatic engagement, the lifting of selected sanctions, and a possible easing of tensions over Ukraine as mechanisms to bring Russia back to a more balanced relationship with the West. [2] The premise of this strategy is based on purely transactional incentives, which cannot fail to work. Soviet Russia’s partnership with communist China at the time had a common ideological bedrock. This Russia-China partnership has for years, with emphasis since the end of the Cold War onward, been built on a shared opposition to Western dominance. 'Both countries benefit from economic cooperation, joint military exercises, and diplomatic coordination in multilateral institutions such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.'[3] The BRICS alliance is de facto led by President Putin, who is considered the initiator and architect of the multipolar world. The New World Order has precisely this objective at its core – the creation of a multipolar world. BRICS lacks the military power of the United States, but it does not lack economic power, which over time could be a good guarantee for the development of its military wing. In this regard, the likelihood of Russia abandoning BRICS, and especially its partnership with China, seems highly unrealistic. President Donald Trump’s recent statements about the withdrawal of US troops from Europe and changes in the world order have sparked numerous discussions about the possible consequences for international security and transatlantic relations. According to diplomatic sources, President Trump has proposed a reduction of about 20,000 US troops in Europe, which represents about 20% of the current US military presence on the continent. The move aims to review the US commitment to the defense of Europe and requires European countries to contribute more financially to cover the costs of the remaining troops, arguing that these forces serve as a deterrent and that the costs cannot be borne solely by US taxpayers. However, some European leaders have expressed their belief that the US has no concrete plans for a complete withdrawal of military troops. Polish President Andrzej Duda, after a meeting with the US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, declared that 'there is absolutely no American intention to reduce activity in our part of Europe, especially in terms of security, or to reduce the number of US troops'.[4] This was the response given to the alarm raised by the German daily in its article with the headline: 'In case of an agreement between Trump and Putin: Europe in fear! Intelligence agencies fear the withdrawal of US troops'.[5] Similar statements were also made by NATO command and US officials in relation to the Balkans. Recently, reports have emerged suggesting the possibility of withdrawing US troops from the Balkans, especially from Kosovo. These reports in the media owned by the oligarchs in Kosovo have been published at lightning speed. These concerns were raised after negotiations between the United States and Russia in Saudi Arabia, where it was speculated that Russia may request the withdrawal of US troops from NATO countries that joined the alliance after 1990. However, senior US and NATO officials have denied these claims. An official from the US Mission to NATO stated that there has been no discussion about reducing or withdrawing US troops from Kosovo. A NATO official also stressed that the US commitment to the Alliance and the presence of US troops in Europe remain strong, and that KFOR continues to implement its mandate to contribute to the establishment of a secure environment in Kosovo. Currently, the US has over 600 troops stationed in Kosovo as part of the KFOR mission, playing a key role in maintaining stability in the region. Italy also contributes over 1,200 troops to this mission. Security experts warn that a possible withdrawal of US troops could have serious consequences for the stability of the region, increasing insecurity and encouraging Serbia to take military action in favor of its already promoted expansionist policies related to the objective of creating a Serbian World. Overall, despite speculation, official statements from the US and NATO confirm the continuation of the US military presence in the Balkans, especially in Kosovo, to ensure peace and stability in the region. 3. The New World Order and Trump's Strategy Authors and strategists gathered around 'MAGA' have long promoted the pro-Russian course by bringing Donald Trump and Musk back to the White House. Only the first month of Trump's return and the installation of Elon Musk in the White House has shown that this pro-Russian course is unstoppable. This process of transition to the Russian sphere, of course claiming Russia's separation from China and the dissolution of the BRICS, will be accompanied by the installation of autocracyin the USand its separation from Europe. This process is being claimed to be a fait accompli even before the mid-term elections. The US thus claims that it will also change the course of the transfer of the global balance of power under China's control. BRICS, led by Russia, China and India, is challenging dedollarization and with it the loss of the US's weight in the Western economic and political order. To avoid this course of events, the victimization of Ukraine is just irredeemable collateral damage in the logic of MAGA strategists. For this reason, they believe that the future of America lies in the creation of a united and integrated entity – a superstate that would dominate in all spheres: from the economy and technology to military and geopolitical power, as one of its authors believes. It is no coincidence that some of Trump’s vision points in this context have already been publicly affirmed, such as his talk about integrating Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal into the United States. These territories are not only geographically important - they are, according to the new MAGA strategists, crucial for the strategic and economic power of America’s future and its role in the New World Order. 'America First' alias MAGA has set forth its concrete objective, which is to completely change the paradigm that Trump had communicated to voters. The Trump administration under the influence of Elon Musk is now acting in accordance with the doctrine that would guarantee the preservation of the status of the hegemonic superpower, even strengthening it. Meanwhile, Europe, alias EU leaders have already realized that the liberal democracy established in European society, is in immediate need of an autonomous strategy that guarantees the state independence of each member and the community as a whole. The prosperity of the hegemonic doctrine of MAGA is based on the development of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, renewable energies, etc.; they require rare minerals. Today in Washington, in the name of MAGA [Make America Great Again], work is being done to change the international institutions that bear the seal of the USA. All this in the name of creating the New World Order. At the foundation of the current Order, let us remember the fact that, it is precisely the institutions created by the US itself – International Law, the UN, NATO, etc. President Trump’s policies, which are de facto the product of the experts who drafted the Make America Great Again platform, have brought about significant changes in the world order. His 'America First' approach has challenged traditional international institutions and alliances, including NATO and the European Union. This approach has raised questions about the US commitment to its allies and has prompted discussions about a new world order, where European countries may be forced to take more responsibility for their own security. In an interview with Euronews Albania, analyst Mentor Beqa emphasized that Trump’s decisions could have major consequences for the world order, including the weakening of traditional alliances and the increasing influence of other powers such as China and Russia. However, President Trump’s statements and actions regarding the withdrawal of US forces from Europe and changes in the world order have sparked debate on the future of global security and international relations. While a quarter of European leaders remain confident in the continuation of American commitment, others warn about the possible consequences of such a withdrawal. It has been a full month since a leader like Donald Trump was installed in Washington, who is challenging the liberal international order, putting narrow national interests ahead of traditional alliances (America First). If the US distances itself from Europe and withdraws from the Alliance, which is unlikely to happen, Albania risks being left without geopolitical protection. NATO may no longer be the umbrella that protects us from the storms, while EU enlargement may continue to remain an open and never-ending story, similar to the fate of the young officer in Dino Buxati’s The Tatar Desert, writes Tirana-based publicist Lutfi Dervishi. But if developments in the new world order include a closer alliance between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, this could have significant consequences for the Balkans. Given that the Balkans have been a sensitive area for the geopolitical influences of great powers, this development could create tensions and strategic shifts. 4. Changing the geopolitical balance We are currently living in an era of the return of empires. Great powers and regional powers are seeking to reclaim or redefine their spheres of influence, as was the case in the eras of classical empires. The return of great rivalries, clashes for resources, territories, and cultural and economic influence, has become more evident, especially after the major geopolitical changes of recent decades. The return of empires in a modern form does not necessarily mean the construction of classical empires with conquered and directly administered territories, but rather an expansion of economic, political, military, and cultural influence. Some superpowers and regional powers show clear tendencies towards a new imperial model. Superpowers with modern imperialist tendencies such as the United States, China, and Russia have already taken the first steps that the change in the geopolitical balance imposes. The United States of America (USA) continues to maintain a vast network of military bases around the world. It controls global financial institutions (such as the IMF and the World Bank). Meanwhile, the use of 'soft power' and 'dollar diplomacy' has enabled it to prevent the BRICS from promoting its currency. While their cultural and technological dominance through corporations such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and Hollywood is evident. China, on the other hand, has projected its rise as a power through the 'Silk Road' initiative (BRI), economically and politically connecting the world to itself. In addition, it has created the first military bases abroad (e.g., in Djibouti). Meanwhile, it uses economic capital and investments to increase its influence (in Africa, Latin America, Europe). But China also has clear ambitions for technological dominance (AI, 5G, etc.). Russia is using military power to restore influence in the post-Soviet space (Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, Central Asia). It is deepening the diplomatic course to maintain alliances with autocratic regimes to oppose the West [case in Serbia, Hungary, Republika Srpska of Bosnia…] For years it has created a monopoly in the energy field and relies on its export as a political instrument and blackmail. Meanwhile, it continues to intensify the use of mercenaries and disinformation to influence other countries, not only in the Balkans. Regional powers with imperialist tendencies have not been left behind in this race. Turkey is reviving the Ottoman legacy through cultural and religious diplomacy in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa. It has intervened militarily in Syria, Libya, Azerbaijan and has become a key player in the Eastern Mediterranean. Its military industry is growing significantly, making it more strategically independent.Iran has built an 'empire' through militias and armed groups in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen (through the Houthis). It uses a combination of religion and ideology to expand its influence in the Shiite world. It has ambitions to become a nuclear power, challenging the West and its Arab rivals. India is increasing its influence in the Indian Ocean and is trying to rival China in Southeast Asia and Africa. It has a large military force and a rapidly growing economy. It is trying to create a sphere of influence through cultural and technological ties. In the modern era, there is no need for military conquests to build an 'empire'. Instead, economics, technology, cultural influence and clever diplomacy are used to create a large sphere of control. The US and China are the two superpowers with the most potential to build their own 'empires', while Russia, Turkey, Iran and India are trying to create their own spheres of influence. Europe is now being forced to prepare to defend Ukraine even without America. It is convinced that this is the only way it can do its best at these historic junctures. If they cannot do this together, as the EU and as Europe, then an alliance of states ready to stop Putin's march will do it. The emergency meeting in Paris proved precisely this expected and necessary strategy of action. This neighborhood of European states has clearly understood that Ukraine must be defended, even without Donald Trump's America. After the scandal during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House, Europe wants to take the initiative. The urgently called summit on Ukraine, which was held in London on March 2, 2025, at which Zelensky was welcomed, Starmer described it as a 'unique moment for European security'. The summit, hosted by the British prime minister, was attended by a dozen European heads of state and government. It came against the backdrop of a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump and his vice president J.D. Vance at the White House on Friday. [6] British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced after a special summit in London what steps Ukraine’s allies had agreed to maintain support for the Russian-occupied country. Starmer said Britain, France and others had agreed to work with Ukraine 'on a plan to end the fighting.' [7] That ceasefire plan would then be discussed with the Trump administration in the United States 'and taken forward together.' Starmer stressed the importance of continued US support. What are the US president’s options after this meeting? The first is about waiting for Zelensky to bow to him, apologize, and agree to sign a deal on Ukraine’s mineral resources without the additional US security guarantees that Kiev and key European countries – the UK, France, and the EU – insist on. Trump, on the other hand, believes that this deal is a sufficient guarantee that the Russians will not be able to launch any new military campaigns against Ukraine in the future, i.e. most of it will remain under Kiev’s control. The second option is for Trump to abandon Ukraine altogether and leave it to the fate of European aid in its ongoing war with Russia, if they so wish. This option is a nightmare for Europe (and certainly for Ukraine, which knows very well who its main strategic partner is and why it managed to preserve its statehood in the first place). Because the European political elites would gladly wage war with Russia with Ukrainian soldiers 'until final victory,' but without sending their own soldiers, as was the case for three years under Joe Biden. They would send them only if the US provided them with security guarantees and only after signing a peace agreement.[8] 4.1 The Curse of Geopolitics: Does the EU Want the Ukraine Negotiations to Fail? Big Issues Are Changing Alliances. Meanwhile, EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas is boldly asserting that the 'free world' needs a new leader and that Europe is the right leader. This statement is widely seen in geopolitical decision-making circles as a Brussels bubble and is not taken seriously. But the negotiations that de facto have not yet taken place are another matter. The bloodshed of a section of European diplomacy over the failure of Trump’s diplomacy in Ukraine is another matter. It seems that Americans and Europeans have returned to the Cold War era, but with opposite roles than they had before. The Trump administration has questioned the US commitment to NATO, demanding that European countries increase their military spending. Even after the changes in the Biden administration, the pressure on Europe to take on more defense responsibilities continues. This has prompted some countries, such as Germany and France, to push for a common European defense, although with no concrete results yet. Meanwhile, as the war in Ukraine continued, Europe was forced to increase its military capabilities and find long-term security solutions without relying solely on the United States. Now it is the Europeans who are advocating tough stances towards Moscow, while Washington is seeking understanding.[9] The different views within the Alliance today have to do exclusively with realpolitik, they are the result of a different geopolitical situation. During the Cold War, Europeans feared that their continent would become a battlefield for a limited nuclear war. For a long time, conflict management through detente seemed to be the best solution for Europe.[10] The new US administration is pursuing its own version of the Heart of the Earth Theory. From this perspective, China and Russia are the heart of Eurasia that will continue to decide the fate of the world in the 21st century. But the real fact that has changed on the ground is China. It is now the dominant power, while Russia is its vassal within the BRICS and vis-à-visthe USA. Moscow, in this context of the curse of geopolitics, especially in relation to Ukraine, has the possibility of becoming a pawn of its own kind in the game of chess. 4.2 Triarchy Plus In 1841, the Jewish-German philosopher Moses Hess published the book 'The European Triarchy'. Hess's basic thesis was that the fate of Europe was determined by three states: Great Britain, France and Germany. Moses Hess, in his theory of the triarchy, focused his analysis on the three main European powers of the 19th century: Great Britain, Germany and France. He argued that these three powers represented three different aspects of political and social development: 1. France as a symbol of revolution and social equality. 2. Germany as a representative of philosophy and intellectual development. 3. Great Britain as a symbol of capitalism and industrialization. Meanwhile, Poland was added to the theory of the triarchy, with emphasis during the course of the war in Ukraine, thus creating a more stable quadrilateral for the new geopolitical circumstances. The war in Ukraine has revealed its role in a modern context, naturally contributing to the shaping of the thesis on the Triarchy Plus. Poland can be considered in many ways as a typical representative of nationalism and self-determination as well as a center of security and geopolitical balance in Central Europe, being at the same time also as a mediator between East and West. So, a Triarchy Plus could function in this way: • Great Britain –representative of the Anglo-Saxon tradition and free-market capitalism. • France – as a leader of European integration and the republican spirit. • Germany – as an economic locomotive and a model of social-democratic stability. • Poland – as the center of a new Europe, which is defining its own strategic role in the East. The role of Poland in the strategic plane in the East could easily be played by Albania and Kosovo in Southeast Europe. 4.3 An imposed peace on Ukraine does not guarantee long-term security in Europe 'America First' has inspired populist and nationalist movements in Europe, fueling more skepticism towards the EU and international institutions. Political forces that follow this approach have gained ground in countries such as Italy, France, Hungary and Poland. Meanwhile, the American intervention [by the Trump administration] in favor of the AfD on the eve of the elections in Germany has raised concerns throughout the liberal and progressive camp. The new German government is meanwhile expected to position itself clearly in support of the course already proclaimed by its European partners such as France, Great Britain, Poland and other states; they are facing a battle to save not only Ukraine. An imposed peace on Ukraine does not guarantee long-term security in Europe. All that the proclaimed agreement can be expected to provide is a ceasefire for an indefinite period. Russia’s expansionist policies continue. Especially in relation to countries that have Russian minorities within their territory. See for this, Putin's Russia must be stopped. The creation of a resistance front is in the interest of European security; it guarantees freedom and life itself. Europe at these historical moments is facing a major geopolitical dilemma. It must strengthen its strategic autonomy in order not to depend on the US for security and economy. In any case, the return of geopolitics is forcing Europe to take more responsibility for its fate. 4.4 The Balkans Faced with a Geopolitical Dilemma In these circumstances, the Balkans are once again faced with the geopolitical dilemma of the pre-Cold War era. Each alternative could have significant strategic, economic or military consequences. This confrontation is related to the challenges and limitations that come from the international environment, the balance of power and national interests. But in this context, if for Albania and the Albanians, as well as for most of the countries in the region, there is no geopolitical dilemma, Serbia, Bulgaria and Hungary are faced with a more serious geopolitical dilemma. Their decisions in this geopolitical confrontation could have profound consequences for the European security architecture, but also for the international order and the balance of power. Serbia is once again faced with the pressure to choose between different alliances - between the EU and Russia. Some Balkan countries, especially those with real aspirations to join the EU, should, in these circumstances, seek greater support and engagement from the European Union to safeguard regional stability. This development could lead to an increase in military tensions in the Balkans, with the possibility of scenarios of direct or indirect involvement of major powers in local conflicts. There could be increased opportunities for destabilization, as is the case with efforts to maintain control over territories that Serbia marks as 'disputed' whether in Bosnia [Republika Srpska] or Kosovo [its north]. In these circumstances, the Balkans could easily become an arena for competition between major powers, such as Russia and China on the one hand, and Turkey and the West on the other. If the Trump-Putin alliance strengthens, Russian and Chinese influence in the region could increase, improving investment, helping the economic development of some Balkan states, and increasing the influence of these states in global politics. Overall, the consequences for the Balkans will depend on how the region reacts to these changes and how international powers coordinate to maintain stability and security in this part of the world. 4.5 The EU and its future In this changing geopolitical balance, the EU continues to be one of the most powerful organizations in the world. At the same time, it is also demonstrating the real possibilities for its transformation into a Military Alliance. However, current challenges show that its future will depend on the ability to maintain unity; on a clear position in favor of Ukrainian sovereignty and finding ways to create the preconditions for a long-term ceasefire or the imposition of peace between Ukraine and Russia; and on its ability to address economic and political crises and adapt its strategies to an increasingly complex world. A closer alliance between Trump and Putin could fuel tensions between Balkan countries that are aligned with the West and those that have closer ties to Russia. Countries like Serbia, which has maintained a stable policy, if not outright vassalage, towards Russia, can feel supported, while the two Albanian republics – Albania and Kosovo, which are engaged side by side with NATO and the European Union, can and should increase the pressure to protect their territorial integrity and independence from Russian influences. In fact, the two Albanian republics in this situation urgently need to move towards the unification of the Strategy, namely the creation of a single defense command. 5. Conclusion: the position of the Albanians The essence of parliamentary democracy and its applied form in established Western liberal democracies is currently under pressure, both from within and from without. Seen in the light of developments on the global level, first of all after the return of Donald Trump to the White House, Transatlantic relations are entering a new historical phase that is expected to face profound tectonic upheaval. The EU is currently facing a threat coming from three directions simultaneously: first, from Russia and its expansionist project; second, from Donald Trump’s America; [11] third, from neo-fascism that is returning in the form of aggressive nationalism within the largest European states themselves. In addition to this upheaval that the age of the New World Order is imposing, the EU and the future of democracy are facing unusual competition with authoritarian-technocratic and authoritarian-autocratic systems. Meanwhile, in the environments of the Nation-State and the EU institutions, democracy is facing the storms brought by the return of neo-fascism in the form of political populism and especially the significant and growing loss of the importance of explicit political engagement by the Western intellectual elite and in particular the social democratic parties which have lost the role they had as functional equivalents since the end of the Second World War. However, the existence of the Nation-State and democracy itself is completely dependent on the presence of the latter in the active life of citizens and the commitment to preserving and establishing the nation-state and democracy simultaneously. The Nation-State turns out to be the bed where democracy can continue to thrive, but with the precondition imposed by the new realignment, namely the New World Order in the making and postmodern geopolitics. In this context, the future of democracy and the nation-state takes on a new meaning, but it is clear that at this historical stage both democracy and the nation-state are expected to undergo profound changes. In this terrain of geopolitical developments, reviewing the future position of our two republics - political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo, but also the Nation as a whole, is crucial. A decisive step in the field of security and defense, see for this, must be taken urgently. This act must be accompanied by the legal-political one, that is, by organizing a referendum on the unification of our two republics. This step will be crucial at the beginning of the process of creating the Albanian Federation and positioning the Nation within the concept of an autonomous European strategy, as an adequate response to the new geopolitical changes that are taking place. 1.

Trust Erodes In India’s Electoral System – OpEd	On March 4, 2025, as I sit to unpack the unfolding saga of duplicate Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers in India, the air feels thick with suspicion, political maneuvering, and a palpable sense of betrayal among voters. The allegations, spearheaded by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal, have cracked open a Pandora’s box, revealing a glitch in the electoral system that the Election Commission of India (ECI) now scrambles to address. The claim is stark: voters in Haryana and West Bengal share identical EPIC numbers, voter IDs meant to be unique, raising questions about the sanctity of the democratic process. The ECI’s admission in a press note dated March 2, 2025, that this mess stems from a decentralized, manual system predating the ERONET platform, only deepens the intrigue. How did this happen? Why was it overlooked? And what does it mean for India’s elections, past and future? Let us start with the basics. The EPIC number, a 10-digit alphanumeric code, is the backbone of voter identification in India. Introduced under the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, and later bolstered by the digital ERONET system, it is designed to ensure every voter has a distinct identity, safeguarding against impersonation and fraud. The ECI has long touted its uniqueness, back in June 2019, it tweeted confidently that 'Every EPIC or Elector’s Photo Identity Card has a unique EPIC Number which can be used to check one’s name in the Electoral Roll.' That assurance now rings hollow as evidence mounts of overlapping numbers across state lines. The TMC’s allegations are not just a regional grumble; they have ignited a national debate, with opposition parties smelling blood and citizens questioning the very foundation of their electoral trust. The ECI’s explanation, detailed in its March 2 press note, offers some clarity but little comfort. Before ERONET, a web-based platform for managing electoral rolls, came into play, voter registration relied on a fragmented, manual process. Different state Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) offices, operating in silos, sometimes used the same alphanumeric series for EPIC numbers. The result? Voters in Haryana and West Bengal, for instance, might share an identical EPIC number, a flaw the ECI insists does not translate to fake voters or fraud. Why? Because these voters are registered in different constituencies, with distinct demographic details and polling booths, making it improbable for one to impersonate another across state borders. It is a technical defense, rooted in logistics rather than intent, but it is done little to quell the storm. Digging deeper, the ECI’s press note and subsequent clarifications, reported by outlets like The Hindu and The Times of India, promise a fix. ERONET 2.0, the next iteration of the platform, is being rolled out to ensure every EPIC number is unique. It is a forward-looking commitment, but it does not erase the past. If duplicates existed for years, how many elections were affected? The ECI insists there is no evidence of fraud, each voter’s identity remains tied to their specific constituency, but the opposition is not buying it. TMC leaders, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, have cried 'voter fraud,' alleging 'fake' and 'outsider' voters propped up the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in past polls. The Congress has joined the chorus, slamming the ECI’s oversight as 'bizarre,' while calls for Supreme Court intervention and election boycotts gain traction. This brings us to a proposed solution that is both tantalizing and divisive: linking EPIC numbers with Aadhaar, India’s 12-digit biometric identification number. Proponents argue it is the silver bullet, tie every voter to a unique Aadhaar ID, and duplicates vanish overnight. The ECI already offers a voluntary linking program, with step-by-step guides circulating online. Fill out Form 6B, submit your Aadhaar details, and you are synced. Simple, right? Not quite. Privacy advocates balk at the idea, warning of data breaches and surveillance creep. Yet, as critics point out, Aadhaar is already demanded for everything from bank accounts to mobile SIMs, why the uproar when it comes to voting? The ECI, for its part, keeps it optional, assuring no voter will be excluded for not linking. That stance, while diplomatic, leaves the core issue unresolved: voluntary measures will not catch every duplicate. The political stakes could not be higher. In West Bengal, where TMC faces a resurgent BJP, the duplicate EPIC scandal is a rallying cry. Banerjee’s claims of electoral manipulation, outsiders ferried in to vote with bogus IDs, echo a narrative of systemic sabotage. The Quint reports her pointing to this as a prelude to the 2026 state elections, a warning shot to both the ECI and her rivals. Across the aisle, the BJP dismisses it as sour grapes, but the ECI’s admission lends credence to at least part of the opposition’s case: the system was not watertight. Meanwhile, overseas Indian voters, who pay taxes but often lack voter IDs or Aadhaar, add another layer of grievance. Why, they ask, cannot the system streamline identity for all citizens, wherever they reside? The ECI’s credibility is on trial here. Once hailed as a pillar of Indian democracy, it is now mocked as a 'caged parrot,' singing to the tune of political masters, an allusion to its perceived coziness with the ruling duo of BJP and its allies. That 2019 tweet, boasting of EPIC’s uniqueness, has come back to haunt it, exposing a gap between rhetoric and reality. The Handbook for Electoral Registration Officers, a dense ECI manual, lays out the process for issuing EPICs, but it is silent on how duplicates slipped through. Citizens like one exasperated X user, struggling for three months to correct a voter ID online, vent frustration at a bureaucracy that preaches digitization while stumbling over basics. 'No voter left behind,' the ECI proclaims, yet the reality feels more like 'no glitch left unexposed.' Could this be the tip of an iceberg? Theories swirl that BJP’s electoral victories, particularly in tight races, owe something to voter roll manipulation. Bogus IDs, duplicate voters, and lax oversight form a shadowy trinity in these accusations, though hard evidence remains elusive. The ECI’s defense, that duplicates do not equal fraud, holds water logically but not emotionally. Trust, once cracked, does not mend with press notes. Opposition leaders demand accountability, with some suggesting a return to ballot paper voting, a nostalgic but impractical fix in a digital age. Others, like legal minds cited on X, urge the Supreme Court to step in, arguing that only judicial oversight can force transparency and punish culprits. Let us weigh the options. The ECI’s ERONET upgrade is a start, promising unique IDs through better tech. It is less invasive than Aadhaar linking, sidestepping privacy debates, but its success hinges on execution, something the ECI’s track record now casts doubt on. Aadhaar, by contrast, offers a robust check, leveraging biometrics to root out overlaps. Yet, making it mandatory risks alienating voters and sparking lawsuits, while keeping it voluntary limits its reach. A hybrid approach, mandatory Aadhaar with ironclad data safeguards, might split the difference, but political will and public buy-in are shaky. For now, the ECI’s hurried note feels like a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The fallout is undeniable. Faith in institutions, already fragile in an era of polarized politics, takes another hit. The ECI, once a referee above the fray, now looks like a player caught off-guard. Opposition parties have a cause to rally around, but their boycott threats could backfire, alienating voters who want reform, not chaos. Civil society, from lawyers to activists, has a role to play, pushing for answers, not just outrage. And the public? They are left sifting through the noise, wondering if their vote, that sacred act, is as secure as they were told. In the end, this is not just about duplicate numbers, it is about what they symbolize: a system stretched thin, a democracy tested, and a trust betrayed. The ECI must do more than patch the holes; it needs to rebuild confidence with transparency, accountability, and perhaps a dash of humility. Linking EPIC to Aadhaar could be part of the fix, but only if paired with guarantees that privacy is not the price. As India barrels toward its next elections, the stakes are too high for half-measures. The dirty linen is out; now, it is time to clean it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJIHRyY6yUCqE	2025-03-08T18:21:31-08:00	
HHS Is Opposing Experimental Bird Flu ‘Vaccines’ For Poultry: USD...	Last week, I wrote about experimental 'vaccines' that the United States government has been working with pharmaceutical companies to develop — different ones for poultry and people. I asked if Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Brooke Rollins, both new to their jobs in February, would stand up against this and other aspects of 'the US government’s bird flu scheme ramped up during the previous presidential administration.' Here is an update. In a new interview at Fox Nation, Kennedy indicated that HHS opposes giving chickens the bird flu 'vaccine.' Kennedy stated: 'There’s no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity, and all three of my health agencies at NIH, CDC, and FDA — the acting heads of those agencies — have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine.' This conclusion is supported, Kennedy stated, by the fact that 'the vaccine could actually promote antigenic shift, which means your turning those birds into mutant factories, and that could actually accelerate the jump [of the bird flu] to human beings.' The catch, though, is that the authority over this in regard to poultry raised in America largely resides in the USDA. Therefore, it is important what Rollins decides. So far, she seems to be 'on the vaccine train' as was her predecessor in the Joe Biden administration. On February 26, Rollin released the USDA’s Five-Pronged Approach to Address Avian Flu that includes substantial boosting of giving a bird flu 'vaccine' to poultry in its fourth of five sections. Here is that section: Explore Pathways toward Vaccines, Therapeutics, and Other Strategies for Protecting Egg Laying Chickens to Reduce Instances of Depopulation USDA will be hyper-focused on a targeted and thoughtful strategy for potential new generation vaccines, therapeutics, and other innovative solutions to minimize depopulation of egg laying chickens along with increased bio-surveillance and other innovative solutions targeted at egg laying chickens in and around outbreaks. Up to a $100 million investment will be available for innovation in this area. Importantly, USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Additionally, USDA will work alongside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure the public health and safety of any such approaches include considerations of tradeoffs between public health and infectious disease strategy. USDA will solicit public input on solutions, and will involve Governors, State Departments of Agriculture, state veterinarians, and poultry and dairy farmers on vaccine and therapeutics strategy, logistics, and surveillance. USDA will immediately begin holding biweekly discussions on this and will also brief the public on its progress biweekly until further notice. Will President Donald Trump step in to settle any disagreement between HHS and USDA on the matter? Notably, the USDA report also indicated that USDA will continue to back the mass slaughter of poultry in the name of countering bird flu, stating that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 'will continue to indemnify producers whose flocks must be depopulated to control the further spread of HPAI.' HPAI is short for highly pathogenic avian influenza — bird flu. As I wrote last week, Kennedy has in his early actions provided reason to expect that he would support ending US involvement in developing and promoting bird flu shots for people, something under the control of his department. He has yet to implement such a change. This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJLjmhE2TKDTJ	2025-03-08T18:17:54-08:00	
Myanmar Junta Chief Says Election To Be Held By January 2026	Myanmar will hold parliamentary elections by January next year, the leader of the ruling military said, without setting a date for a vote that the generals who seized power in 2021 will be hoping will end widespread opposition to their grip on politics. The junta’s opponents say a vote under the military while the most popular politicians are locked up and their parties banned will be a sham. The junta is in control of only about half the country after significant losses to pro-democracy and ethnic minority insurgents fighting to end military rule. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing announced the timing of the election while on a visit to Belarus on Friday, the military-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported. 'The election is slated for December 2025, with the possibility of … January 2026,' the newspaper quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying. There was no immediate comment from forces opposed to military rule but a parallel civilian government in exile, the National Unity Government, has previously dismissed the junta’s plan for an election as window-dressing to bolster the military’s legitimacy at home and abroad. Allied ethnic minority insurgent groups fighting for self-determination have also rejected an election under military rule. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi – by far the most popular political leader in Myanmar – has been jailed since the military ousted her elected government on Feb. 1, 2021. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, which swept elections in 2015 and 2020, has been dissolved under military regulations and thousands of its members and supporters are in jail or have fled to rebel zones or into self-exile. China, which has major investments in Myanmar and is keen to see an end to its turmoil, supports the vote and has offered help to organize it, as have some of Myanmar’s Southeast Asian neighbors. Min Aung Hlaing, in a speech in Belarus, said 53 political parties had submitted paperwork to take part in the election. 'We also invite the observation teams from Belarus to come and observe,' he said. Voting is expected to be held in fewer than half of Myanmar’s 330 townships in the first phase of a staggered vote, a political party official said late last year after discussion with the election organizers. In Myanmar’s last election in 2020, voting was held in 315 out of the 330 townships. After Suu Kyi’s party swept the vote, as it did in a 2015 election, the army complained of cheating and overthrew her government. She has been jailed for 27 years. Election organizers said at the time there was no evidence of any significant cheating. Min Aung Hlaing was in Belarus after a visit to Russia where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJHBLrZUSNRzZ	2025-03-08T18:14:00-08:00	
Germany’s Coalition Deal Inches Closer	By Bárbara Machado (EurActiv) -- Germany's Christian Democrats and Social Democrats are ready to start formal coalition negotiations, after exploratory talks ended positively. Christian Democrats (CDU) leader Friederich Merz, who won Germany's federal elections last month, told reporters on Saturday that preliminary talks on a future coalition with the SPD ended in agreement, Tagesschau reports. After exploratory talks, the conservatives and SPD agreed on a final paper, based on which negotiations can now start. According to Taggeschau, Merz said in Berlin that an agreement was reached on several issues, including migration and finance, topics that until now divided the groups. Formal negotiations to close a governing coalition can begin as early as next week, and should last until Easter.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJDDFtH9RotFd	2025-03-08T18:07:20-08:00	
Pray For A Peaceful Al-Aqsa Mosque – OpEd	Tens of thousands of Muslim worshipers prayed peacefully at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on the first Friday of Ramadan despite fears of unrest due to tensions over the Gaza war. The Islamic Waqf, which manages the holy site, announced that some 90,000 people attended the Friday midday prayer. Israel had implemented safety restrictions at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, over ninety thousand Palestinians came to pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam that is located in East Jerusalem. This year Ramadan coincides with a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has largely halted fighting after a devastating war that left many thousands dead in Israel and Gaza. Last year, amid the Gaza war, Israeli authorities imposed restrictions on visitors coming to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Only men aged 55 and older and women over 50 were allowed to enter the mosque compound for security reasons, while thousands of Israeli police officers were deployed across Jerusalem's Old City and no major violence occurred. By long standing convention, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray in the compound, which they revere as the site of their second temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. The Israeli government has said repeatedly that it intends to uphold the status quo at the Mosque, but many Palestinian use fears about the future of the Mosque as a flashpoint for violence. Last year, Israel allowed Muslims to worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque in the same numbers as in the previous year despite the war raging in Gaza and no major violence occurred. There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a small Jewish house of worship 'hologram', which is a 3D projection created with lasers, could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock and 600 feet north of the Al-Aksa Mosque, provided that Muslims would agree to cooperate. Anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important, and anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, Jewish/Christian/Muslim agreements establishing world wide peace would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each Jewish-Christian-Muslim community could consider its leadership to be essentially Messianic, Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its own leadership to be essential Messianic aids as is foretold: 'Saviors [plural] will come up on mount Zion' (Prophet Obadiah 1:21) and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Prophet Micah (4:3-5): 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk, each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings; the Messianic Age of world wide peace will surely have arrived, and then-and only then-will the Jerusalem Temple of Solomon be rebuilt, and God's Holy Kingdom established on earth. A total of 51,600 deaths in Gaza were reported by the UN, as of January 14, 2025, including 7,000 from natural causes and 2,000 killed by Hamas. War-related fatalities were: 22,600 civilians and 20,000 combatants for a civilian/combatant ratio: ~1:1 The writer, a board member of Honest Reporting, has closely reviewed the data for 15 months. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib says, 'From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.' I say we can make it truly aspirational by making it focus on both people first and the land second. 'From the river to the sea Palestinians and Israelis should be freed of hatred and suffering by 'a two state for two peoples sharing of the land peacefully solution.'' As the Qur'an states: 'Good and evil deeds are not equal. Repel evil with what is better; then you will see that one who was once your enemy has become your dearest friend...' (41:34) And as the Qur'an states: ''Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearest to being God-fearing.' (5:8)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJCUZlNZE-2vR	2025-03-08T18:05:06-08:00	
Trump Confident Putin Wants Peace Despite ‘Bombing The Hell Out O...	By Jeff Seldin Russia’s latest aerial barrage against targets in Ukraine is not dampening expectations by U.S. President Donald Trump that he can broker a deal to end the fighting between Moscow and Kyiv. Ukrainian officials Friday accused Russia of launching more than 200 overnight missile and drone strikes against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure across a broad swath of the nation, hitting targets in five regions while damaging residential buildings and injuring residents. But Trump, speaking to reporters Friday in the Oval Office, said he takes Russian President Vladimir Putin at his word when Putin says he wants peace. 'I believe him. I think we're doing very well with Russia,' Trump said, acknowledging that for the moment 'they're bombing the hell out of Ukraine.' 'He’s doing what anybody else would do,' the U.S. president said of Putin. 'I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.' Trump also expressed continued frustration with Kyiv. 'I'm finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine. They don’t have the cards,' he told reporters. When asked if the United States would consider giving Ukraine additional air defenses, Trump said it depended on Ukraine. 'I have to know that they want to settle. I don’t know that they want to settle,' he said. 'If they don't want to settle, we're out of there because we want them to settle.' Other U.S. officials, meanwhile, have pushed back against the notion that Trump’s tactics to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table — which has included a pause on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv — have made Ukraine more vulnerable. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told Fox News late Thursday that the pause on intelligence sharing is designed only to prevent Ukraine from launching offensive operations against Russia. 'Any intelligence going toward defending Ukraine against attacks coming into their country would continue,' Gabbard said. A U.S. defense official Friday confirmed to VOA that there has been no pause on intelligence that would allow Ukraine to defend itself, adding that Ukraine also maintains access to Starlink, the satellite internet system owned by Trump ally Elon Musk. As for the overnight attack by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on social media that many of the drones were taken out by antiaircraft defenses. He said that for the first time, French-made Mirage fighter jets were deployed in air defense, and that U.S-made F-16s were also used. Zelenskyy, in a statement on his X social media account Friday, said that despite the Russian attacks, Kyiv is committed to seeking peace. 'Intense work with President Trump’s team has been ongoing at various levels — numerous calls,' he wrote. 'The topic is clear — peace as soon as possible, security as reliably as possible. Ukraine is fully committed to a constructive approach.' In a separate statement on Telegram, however, Zelenskyy expressed frustration with Moscow. 'Every day, new Russian attacks and reality itself prove that it is Russia that must be forced to make peace — to stop the war, to engage in real diplomacy,' he said, according to a translation of his comments. The latest barrage of Russian missiles and the responses from the U.S. and Ukraine come as Zelenskyy plans to travel to Saudi Arabia Monday for meetings with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss a possible ceasefire with Russia. The meeting would be the first between Zelenskyy and U.S. officials since the Ukrainian leader’s contentious White House meeting last week with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as reporters looked on. Earlier this week in a letter sent to Trump, Zelenskyy said the way the meeting went was 'regrettable' and Ukraine was 'ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible.' VOA’s Patsy Widakuswara and Jeff Custer contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJDwEB3BCQvc6	2025-03-08T18:00:12-08:00	
Cutting Off Terror’s Lifeline – OpEd	Yet once again, a troubled geopolitical landscape in Afghanistan has become the focus of international attention. The fears were revived that nation could once again become a fertile breeding ground for global terrorism since the U.S. withdrew in 2021. The development of this crisis hinges on the deeply disturbing fact that donations of humanitarian and monetary aid meant to assist Afghanistan’s civilian population are being used to perpetuate terrorist networks. U.S. legislators, however, have rose up rising to the situation in the form of the ‘No Taxpayer Funding for Terrorists Act’—a legislative move that aims at reconstructing the United States approach in providing aid for than the Taliban has profited with the help of international help. The financial leakage is overwhelmingly high. The United Nations and non-governmental organizations, according to reports, receive roughly $40 million a week in U.S. aid to flow into Afghanistan’s Central Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has confirmed that the transfers to these funds are ostensibly earmarked for humanitarian relief, but the Taliban regime withdraws nearly $10 million from these transfers in tribute to the oppressive governance it implements — and to its army of influence including Al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. This diversion points to a depressing paradox: well-intended aid is in fact subsidizing precisely the perpetrators of violence and instability for whom the world’s most severe humanitarian crisis is desperately needed. A further tactic of Taliban’s strategic co-opting of international aid channels and stealing the goodwill of the greater global sympathy is that it leaves Afghan citizens caught between their deprivation and terror. Senator Tim Sheehy’s legislation is aimed at cutting this lifeline. The law, called ‘The ‘No Taxpayer Funding for Terrorists Act’, introduced by Congressman Tim Burchett, prevents U.S. financial aid to Afghanistan under current oversight guidelines, a status critics say creates loopholes and easy avenues for them to funnel money in. Wading into unfamiliar territory with a change of face to the Taliban has given momentum to the bill that previously languished in Senate committees. The sort of hardening consensus reflected by the act, with robust support in the House, is that America’s $2.35 billion per year in aid to Afghanistan should entail stringent safeguards or outright cessation to avoid further infiltration by malign actors. By pushing further, Sheehy pursues a broader Biden administration strategy to recalibrate counterterrorism to financial attrition through economic erosion of the economic infrastructure supporting extremist operations. Nevertheless, there’s dissent among lawmakers. It is humanitarian organizations that warn about the potential increase in Afghanistan’s crises, as the 28 million people there rely on external aid for their very survival. Afghans survive on 3$ a day and there is rampant food insecurity and collapsing healthcare systems, says the UN estimates, 97 percent live in poverty. They argue that isolating the Taliban economically would merely expose it to collective punishment, further destabilize the area and help radicalization. However, proponents say it is necessary to suspend the system because the current aid arrangement is not transparent enough to prevent abuse and it should only resume when clear safeguards are in place. What you have here is this idea of dichotomy, moral obligations to civilians being soothed against this imperative of neutralising the existential threats, this is the ethical dilemma of modern counter terrorism. The U.S.’s stance also represents a drastic change in foreign policy from a reactive military to a pre-emptive financial containment. Washington is targeting revenue streams to tear down terrorism’s economic underpinnings, a tactic adopted around the world after it was proven successful in forcing melancholy on Iran and North Korea. This approach forces Afghanistan to rely on multilateral collaboration to shut down the banking operations of Taliban financed institutions and facilitate aid through other delivery mechanisms, either through direct partnerships at the grassroots level or via secure digital platforms. The problem involves not only fashioning a method neither entirely leaving Afghan civilians nor stiffening up at their oppressors but doing so with diplomatic delicacy and technological flair. Following Recommendations Build up a NATO, EU and UN partner team to develop a unified task force to audit aid disbursement and implement tough accountability protocols. The aid should proceed through decentralized ledgers in real time to bypass Taliban controlled channels. Imposing secondary sanctions against foreign entities that engage with Taliban linked businesses to disrupt illicit financing related to narcotics, mining, or taxation. Work with neighbouring countries Pakistan and Uzbekistan to agree on an aid route on the border managed by trusted NGOs and international observers. Public and diplomatic pressure on to delegitimize the Taliban’s governance, amplify the voices of Afghan civil society through international platforms.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJH4RBoSl11hh	2025-03-08T17:52:57-08:00	
Pakistan And Azerbaijan: Strengthening Bilateral Cooperation – Op...	Recently, Pakistan and Azerbaijan have signed several agreements and Memorandums of understandings (MoUs) to boost bilateral cooperation in their trade as well as energy sectors. The visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Baku proved to be a watershed visit where he held productive exchange of views with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. These things are the beginning of a good and strategic partnership to the two countries. The agreements mark a milestone in the transformation of Pakistan Azerbaijan relations to much more substantive economic cooperation than what has been possible by limited traditional diplomatic ties. However, the most important of all agreements includes the act of increasing bilateral investments to $2 billion through projects which will be beneficial to both parties. Beyond showing Azerbaijan’s confidence in Pakistan’s economic potential, this financial commitment helps boost Pakistan’s readiness as a profitable investment location. These collaborative efforts will be upgraded further with the signing of formal agreements during the upcoming visit of President Aliyev to Pakistan. The next important development in this context is the MoU signed between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and Pakistan State Oil (PSO). The MoU outlines collaborative efforts in association with Machike Thallian Tarujabba White Oil Pipeline Project- a strategic initiative to augment Pakistan’s energy security and reducing of transportation cost. The project will hold significant importance in ensuring easy transportation of oil and its use for the sake of progress of Pakistan’s industrial and economic landscape. In the tourism and education fields, outside the energy field, there is more long-term profit that can be derived. These sectors where the MoUs have been inked will encourage cultural exchange, educational cooperation and will help to strengthen the people to people ties between the two nations. Both Pakistan and Azerbaijan have a rich cultural history, and the scenery are beautiful, and these agreements will pave new ways for students, professionals, and investors to come and enjoy it as well as academic and tourism collaboration. In addition, the agreements further focused on strengthening the bilateral defense ties. Pakistan and Azerbaijan have agreed to produce defense equipment in joint manufacturing, that has economic and strategic importance. JF 17 Thunder fighter jet sale to Azerbaijan is a fulfillment of Pakistan’s growing ability to produce defense production and confidence of the international community of Pakistan defense manufacturing capabilities. Besides increasing Pakistan’s defense exports, this deal fortifies Azerbaijan’s military capabilities. In fact, Pakistan’s struggle to overcome its long-standing energy shortages is a long fought battle. But the recent agreements with Azerbaijan come at a turning point. Smooth flow of oil shall be taken care of in White Oil Pipeline and for greater flexibility in procuring energy supply agreements of LNG are given. Consequently, Pakistan would be able to cut down financial burden on its foreign exchange reserves, to procure energy in a manner which is sustainable and cost effective. Now, the economic collaboration between Pakistan and Azerbaijan also reflects the improvement taking place in Pakistan’s business environment. Azerbaijan’s plan to invest in Pakistan is a result of the country’s increasing attractiveness as investment destination as the government is focusing on policy reforms and ease of doing business. Currently the two countries conduct trade worth $55 million in total, yet with the newly signed agreements and development projects, the trade volume between two countries is expected to cross $2 billion within the next few years. This is milestone in the economic growth and regional integration of Pakistan. Additionally, both Pakistan and Azerbaijan hold significant geostrategic importance. Both Pakistan is a gateway to South Asia and the Middle East and so is Azerbaijan bridging Europe and Central Asia. Increased trade and connectivity between the two countries will enhance their economic cooperation as both strengthen the performance of regional economies at large. The partnership portends a model of regional economic collaboration particularly amongst the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states. The agreements also fit into Pakistan’s long-term aspirations to diversify its energy sources. As a player in the oil and gas sector, Azerbaijan is an apt partner to help Pakistan transit to a sustainable energy future. The ventures on LNG and pipeline projects will allow technological advancements and expertise to enter Pakistan for the benefits of the energy infrastructure. Moreover, Pakistan’s emerging manufacturing industry is also recognized worldwide as Azerbaijan continues buying Pakistan defense products. This is an indication of the country’s capacity to generate high quality exports of goods and the country being a strong player in defense industry as well as the world industrial fields. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor in conjunction with these new trade agreements, is locking Pakistan into a position as a trade hub to South and Central Asia. The Pakistan – Azerbaijan agreements strengthen this position by adding further to infrastructure and logistical and investment channels. Following Recommendations: Build institutional frameworks that sufficiently promote the smooth implementation of agreements and MoUs. Encourage public private partnerships to maximize the economic benefit from the $2 billion investment. Promote technological exchange in the energy, defense and industrial sectors for the sake of innovation. Engage in joint venture with respect to manufacturing aimed at increasing industrial productivity. Determine comprehensive trade policies so that the increasing trade volume could be maximized. Encourage policies that will further attract foreign direct investments. Use Azerbaijan’s experience of working with the energy to modernize oil and gas infrastructure of Pakistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJGmqW57PoU7Q	2025-03-08T17:50:20-08:00	
Iran Rules Out Talks With US Under Maximum Pressure	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Tehran won’t hold any negotiations about its nuclear program with the US as long as the Trump administration applies its 'maximum pressure' policy. Iran will maintain talks with other negotiators but will not engage with the US under Trump's approach of ramping up sanctions, Araqchi said in an interview with AFP in Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah on Friday. AFP: Is Iran prepared to reopen negotiations with the US on its nuclear program? Araqchi: We will not enter any direct negotiations with the US so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats but it doesn't mean that regarding our nuclear program, we will not negotiate with other parties; we are talking with the three European countries, we are negotiating with Russia and China, other members of the JCPOA, and these talks can continue and I think we can reach a result from this path too. As long as the US government continues its pressure, we will also continue our resistance. If America wants to return to a new nuclear agreement with Iran, naturally it should observe the conditions of a fair and just negotiation and we have proven that we will not answer the language of pressure and threat but will respond to the language of respect and dignity as we did in the past. Regarding our nuclear program, I repeat, we are currently engaged in negotiations with the three European countries. We are in close consultation with Russia and China, and we are continuing our discussions with other countries that are interested. It is natural that our points of view will be conveyed by these countries to the American government. AFP: How do you respond to Israel's threat to attack Iran's nuclear program? Araqchi: Look, first of all, Iran's nuclear program cannot be destroyed through military operations, for several reasons. The first reason is that this is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed. Second, Iran's nuclear facilities are scattered in many different parts of the country and are properly protected, and we are sure that they cannot be destroyed. Third, we have the ability to respond very strongly and in a completely proportionate and balanced manner. The Israelis themselves know, and others in the region know, that any action taken against Iran will be followed by a similar action against Israel. Therefore, I think that the threat of war against Iran is a threat that is just talked about. Implementing this threat would be a very big danger and would turn into a widespread fire. I think that if the Israelis or others were sure that they would achieve their goals through a military attack, they would have done so by now, but such a possibility is not feasible. I believe that if an attack on Iran were to take place, this attack could turn into a widespread fire in the region; not that we will do that. It is Israel's desire to involve the other countries in the region in a war. It is Israel's desire to draw America into a war. This is precisely an Israeli plan to drag America into war, and America is extremely vulnerable if it enters a war in the region. They themselves know this. I think that both Israel and America and others are fully aware of our capabilities, and therefore, if rationality prevails, even the permission for threatening Iran should not be given, let alone an actual military attack. AFP: Turkey has accused Iran of using militias to destabilize other countries. How do you respond? Araqchi: I don't think anyone doubts that the developments in Syria were directly influenced by Turkey and a few other countries, and therefore the problems that have arisen now, such as the widespread occupation of Syrian territory by Israel, the destruction of all of Syria's defense and scientific infrastructure by Israel, and all of the conflicts that exist, naturally, the responsibility lies with those who carried out these changes and developments. However, this does not mean that we are in conflict with Turkey; no, we will continue our friendly relations and continue our consultations on regional issues. AFP: Will Iran establish ties with the new Syrian government? Araqchi: There are many illegal groups in Syria, some of which are still on the UN list of terrorist groups. The policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is quite clear. We want stability and peace in Syria. We want to preserve the territorial integrity of Syria. We want to preserve the territorial unity of Syria and oppose the division of Syria. We want an end to the foreign occupation in Syria. We want the progress and development of the Syrian people. Finally, we want the formation of an inclusive government in Syria. Any military confrontation with the people, any incident that leads to the death of people, and any military conflict that destabilizes Syria are condemned in our opinion and must be prevented. The Islamic Republic of Iran is currently only an observer of Syrian issues; we have no relationship with the current Syrian government, and we are not in a hurry in this regard. However, we hope that the developments in Syria will move towards an inclusive popular government, and we hope that all illegal groups whose work has led to the instability in Syria will return to the rule of law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJE3v2dZmQm4T	2025-03-08T17:47:06-08:00	
Three Scenarios For The War In Ukraine – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu Battlefield Assessment Last week both sides won modest tactical gains. But no strategic changes altered the map significantly. In eastern Ukraine, areas adjacent to Pokrovsk saw continued intensive combat, while the southern theater was relatively calm. In occupied Kherson, the Ukrainian Separate 14th Regiment successfully targeted a Russian training ground with cluster munitions. In Ukraine’s north, near Kharkiv, Russia conducted air and missile strikes. The Russian military continued to suffer more than 1,000 casualties per day, and Ukraine carried out multiple loitering munitions salvos targeting the Russian hydrocarbon network. Kursk was a notable exception to the general battlefield stasis. Russia has been pushing hard in Kursk following the return of North Korean servicemen to combat operations. Alarmingly, the Ukrainian military lost 15 to 20 square miles in less than a week. Ukrainian defense intelligence officials announced that they have been tracking a serious hike in Russian drone proliferation efforts, with the joint Russia-Iran drone plant in the Russian Republic of Tatarstan boosting production capacity. According to other Ukrainian officials, the Russian military has long sought to achieve the capability to launch 500 drones at Ukraine in a single salvo, a dangerous strike pattern if it can be realized. The increase in Russia’s drone production is an important trend that this report will continue to monitor. Three Scenarios for the Future of the Conflict in Ukraine While the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve and the diplomatic picture remains dynamic, three possible outcomes seem most likely. Scenario 1: Managed Decline The first plausible outcome is that Ukraine manages to stabilize the front lines through tactical withdrawals in the face of mounting losses. In this scenario, the Ukrainian military continues to demonstrate resilience despite its declining capabilities and the rupture in Kyiv’s partnership with the United States. Nonetheless, Ukraine would need to withdraw its forces from Kursk to augment defensive operations at home, costing Kyiv invaluable leverage. Ukraine would endure a slow decline in its military capabilities while forestalling collapse. Ukraine’s domestic drone proliferation edge and extensive antipersonnel and anti-armor mine capabilities would help it stabilize the front. Yet it would continue to face challenges from manpower shortages. Kyiv’s indigenous loitering munitions and hybrid weapons would help it target Russian energy and defense hubs. But Russian, North Korean, and Iranian weapons would continue to pound Ukrainian cities, where the Ukrainian military would have to prioritize protecting high-value targets. This scenario would likely involve continued deterioration in bilateral security and defense ties between Washington and Kyiv, but not a rapid halt in arms flows. Pending arms transfers already in the pipeline would continue, particularly under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a framework that has created new contracts between Kyiv and American defense suppliers. Under this scenario arms flows to Ukraine could continue until 2028, though likely dropping below $1 billion in volume by the second quarter of 2027. This would mean the battlefield geometry in Ukraine would remain largely the same. Still, losing control over its territory in Kursk would deprive Kyiv of critical diplomatic leverage to negotiate a return of its Russian-occupied territories. Scenario 2: The Worst Case In the second plausible scenario for the future of the conflict, Russian and North Korean fighters overpower Ukraine with a massive surge, attaining a decisive force-on-force ratio in multiple sectors. In the absence of US military aid and intelligence support, Ukraine faces serious setbacks in its defensive combat operations. Kyiv is forced to surrender, and European nations offer only diplomatic gestures. This is no doubt a worst-case scenario for Ukraine. In the absence of American intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assistance at the strategic and operational levels, Ukraine would face catastrophic personnel losses. Without sufficient support, Russia could break Ukraine’s defensive lines and force its government to capitulate—the original political aim of Russia’s full-scale invasion. In this scenario, North Korean troops would play a decisive role in turning the tide for Russia. The US Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that the bulk of Pyongyang’s combat formations in Kursk belong to North Korea’s 11th Corps, a strategic force trained to open a second front in a conventional conflict or attack an enemy’s rear area. According to the South Korean intelligence service, this North Korean contingent recently resumed combat operations in Kursk following a rotation period. In a worst-case scenario, North Korea could increase its force size from division-level to corps-level and begin to fight on Ukrainian territory, rather than just in Kursk. Russia could initiate another limited mobilization effort in the meantime. Together with forces from North Korea, such an effort could add between 300,000 and 350,000 troops to the 580,000 to 620,000 servicemen Russia has already deployed in Ukraine and Kursk. Ukraine’s forces number roughly 800,000, but only one-fourth of this force has been sent to direct combat roles on the front lines. The force-on-force ratio between Ukrainian and Russian troop concentrations already favors the invader at varying proportions in different sectors, ranging from 1:2 to 1:6. A Russian and North Korean force-generation push would make things even worse for Ukraine. Sadly, Europe’s defense industry is not in a position to support Ukraine in a prolonged conflict where Russia and its allies can ramp up production at will. The European Union, following extensive discussions, aims to boost its annual artillery production to 2 million rounds in 2025. Yet North Korea alone can produce the same amount in peacetime. Pyongyang has delivered up to 6 million rounds to the Russian military in two years, hinting at its wartime production capacity. Russia’s annual round-production capacity is believed to be somewhere between 3 million rounds and 4.5 million rounds for principal guns. Türkiye, which is in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but not the EU, is the only European nation that produces multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS). European nations largely rely on American M-270 and M-142 HIMARS systems, though some turn to Israel or South Korea for stopgap procurements. Europe also lags in the production of air and missile defense interceptors, a troubling trend while Russia hammers Ukraine with Iran-made drones. Since September 2024 Russia has launched at least 1,000 Shahed drones per month. November 2024 and January 2025 each saw over 2,500 loitering munitions launched at Ukrainian population centers. American-made Patriot systems have been the primary long-range and high-altitude layer of Ukraine’s surface-to-air missile defenses. While the European SAMP/T could theoretically replace the American Patriot, the European solution has a more focused design that aims at ballistic missiles and aircraft but lacks the Patriot’s ability to target broad-spectrum threats from drones to cruise missiles. Intercepting drones does not require the use of long-range SAMs. But these robotic systems complicate the air picture and overwhelm layered air defenses, paving the way for follow-on ballistic missile and cruise missile salvos. More important, the Patriot has a larger market share and a more substantial production capacity for its PAC-2 and PAC-3 interceptors. Moreover, the Patriot is the only reliable weapons system Kyiv has against high-hypersonic aeroballistic missiles like the Russian Kinzhal. Given its air defense challenges, Ukraine needs a constant flow of Patriot interceptors to protect its skies. In a collapse scenario, Ukraine’s manpower shortages and difficulty stabilizing the front would only exacerbate its air defense troubles. Major breaches in Ukrainian lines of defense in the east and a successful Russian push on various flashpoints like Pokrovsk could spell doom for Ukraine. In this scenario, the Kremlin could force Kyiv to capitulate. Ukraine could be compelled to swallow a partial demilitarization and the loss of almost 20 percent of its territory. NATO and its member states would not legally recognize this outcome, but in the absence of credible US deterrents, the de facto arrangement could quickly become the status quo. Scenario 3: The Best Case The final possible scenario for the future of Ukraine is a significant shift in the conflict’s dynamics. It would see a revival of US-Ukraine relations, marked by the signing of a valuable minerals deal and the introduction of new indigenous and foreign loitering munitions systems and drone-missile hybrid weapons to drastically enhance Ukraine’s long-range strike capabilities. In this scenario, systematic Ukrainian attacks continue to damage Russian hydrocarbon revenues. The Ukrainian occupation of Kursk deepens and stabilizes. US-led diplomatic pressure prompts Russia’s political leadership to discuss a comprehensive ceasefire, including a territorial swap. Ukraine retains near-ally status with NATO and faces no restrictions in keeping its military capacity in the aftermath of the war. This scenario, if realized, could significantly alter Ukraine’s future—and the Kremlin’s geopolitical orientation. This would require a revival of bilateral ties between Washington and Kyiv. A minerals deal between the two countries would catalyze Western investment opportunities in Ukraine, creating a tangible deterrent against further Russian escalation. In the meantime, the Ukrainian military would continue to benefit from the nation’s growing defense industries, which have gradually integrated themselves into the West’s defense technological and industrial base. Ukraine’s developing drone and missile warfare prowess would inflict unbearable damage on Russian energy and defense industrial targets. NATO members would make clear that they would not tolerate tactical nuclear action from the Russian military in Europe. Emboldened by lucrative arms deals with Washington in return for valuable resources and boosted European defense assistance funds, Ukraine would deepen its territorial gains in Kursk. In this final scenario, the Kremlin could agree to a comprehensive ceasefire deal following American diplomatic efforts. Ukrainian and Russian diplomats could consider a swap of occupied territory. A multi-brigade European security assurance force could deploy to Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine could gain host-nation status for the NATO Force Model.

Counterterrorism Shortcomings In Mali, Burkina Faso, And Niger – ...	By Michael DeAngelo Policy Problem (FPRI) -- As the global epicenter of Salafi-jihadi activity, the Sahel in 2023 accounted for 26 percent of global terrorist attacks, which caused 47 percent of terrorist-related deaths. Burkina Faso is ranked as the country most affected by terrorism in the world, followed by Mali in third place and Niger in tenth. Both would be one spot higher if not for Hamas’s October 2023 attacks in Israel. These standings show the prevalence and lethality of jihadist groups in the Sahel. The situation has not always been this dire. After Malian and French security forces regained control of northern Mali from jihadists in 2014, terrorist attacks were infrequent. There was little evidence of insurgencies until 2016. However, jihadist activity rose steadily from 2017 until 2021, and since 2021, jihadist attacks have doubled and resulting deaths have tripled. Mali has little control over its northern regions and is constantly contested in its central regions. Jihadist groups control or contest over half of Burkina Faso. In all three countries, jihadists are encircling areas closer to the capitals. Attacks have spread to coastal countries Benin, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire. Thus, jihadist groups have reconstituted since their 2014 setback to wage escalating insurgencies and conduct complex terrorist attacks. Origins The sources of the current insurgencies are ethnic tensions and weak governments. The Sahel is very diverse, which creates competing interests; several ethnic groups make their livelihoods in ways that conflict with each other. For example, many Fulani, a primarily Muslim ethnic group residing throughout West Africa, rely on livestock herding, which often leads to conflicts with groups that rely on agriculture such as the Dogon and Mossi. This has caused the oppression of some groups at the hands of others, which sometimes is either ignored or encouraged by their governments. Therefore, parts of the population distrust the government’s intentions, a view furthered by the government’s inability to provide basic services. Sahelian governments have historically taken an elite-centric approach, developing capitals while neglecting rural areas. This has created ungoverned spaces where the government is not present, especially in border areas. A variety of criminal and insurgent groups render these areas insecure. Thus, the populations in many areas outside of the capitals view their government as indifferent and, when it is present, ineffective and ill-intentioned. Jihadist groups view this shortcoming as an opportunity to control territory by providing security and governance. With the drivers of the jihadist insurgencies in place, the Libyan and Malian civil wars sparked them beginning in 2011 and 2012. Armed Tuareg, a primarily Muslim, pastoralist ethnic group historically marginalized in the Sahel, began pushing Malian security forces out of northern Mali in early 2012. An assortment of jihadist groups both directly and loosely affiliated with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb opportunistically joined the fight. A massive proliferation of arms smuggled from unguarded Libyan depots after Muammar Qaddafi’s fall aided them. Jihadist groups quickly assumed control of territory and established a proto-caliphate that included the regional capital, Timbuktu. They provided security and governance, complete with justice and education systems. When French and Malian security forces pushed them out during Operation Serval (2013–14), jihadist groups spent multiple years regrouping in ungoverned spaces like the cross-border areas of Mali, Niger, and Algeria. They accessed arms easily and recruited militants from still-marginalized ethnic groups. They funded their activity through crimes such as drug and contraband smuggling and kidnapping; ransom payment is one of their primary sources of income. They increased attacks throughout 2015 and 2016, eventually beginning another insurgency. JNIM vs. ISSP The wide range of jihadist groups consolidated in 2017, becoming Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)—the Support Group for Islam and Muslims—and pledging allegiance to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Qaeda central. This merger formalized ties between groups and increased their geographical reach to Burkina Faso and Niger. The U.S. Department of State subsequently designated JNIM as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. One of the merged groups is Katiba Macina, and a closely affiliated group is Ansarul Islam; both are Fulani-dominated, the former operating in central Mali and the latter in Burkina Faso. The inclusion of the Fulani is vital, as they are populous but have been historically marginalized across the Sahel due to their pastoralism. This has put them in conflict with sedentary farming communities. While JNIM is still led and heavily influenced by the Tuareg, it is more diverse and decentralized than the groups in 2012. This allows it to navigate ethnic tensions and recruit more broadly from the population of the Sahel. The other predominant jihadist group is the Islamic State–Sahel Province (ISSP). Formed from JNIM splinter groups, ISSP pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after he declared an Islamic State caliphate. The U.S. Department of State also designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. Although JNIM initially remained the primary jihadist actor in the Sahel, ISSP has drastically increased its activity since 2020; this is why it was recently named an Islamic State province. Both groups have the same goals: to eliminate secular and Western influence, and to establish an Islamist state in West Africa. However, differences between their central organizations have disrupted collaboration and caused conflict. Al-Qaeda favors a localized approach to jihad that can bridge ethnic tensions and gradually implement Islamic law. The Islamic State favors a universal approach that targets alleged non-believers and rapidly implements maximalist Islamic law. ISSP has justified 'war' against JNIM due to the latter’s 'apostate leaders,' specifically when it comes to their more permissive approach to civilians and Christians. Conflict has been sporadic; in late 2023, ISSP pushed JNIM out of the Menaka region of Mali. They are both prevalent in the tri-border area of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. JNIM is more prevalent in Mali and Burkina Faso, while ISSP is so in Niger. Thus, JNIM and ISSP are waging simultaneous insurgencies that clash intermittently. A Strategy of Insurgency While these jihadists are often portrayed as terrorists in Western media, they are primarily insurgents who employ terrorism tactically. If they had a strategy of terrorism, jihadists would mostly target civilians; their goal would be to shock the government into a policy change, provoke repression, or instigate political and societal disorder. Instead, their activity is aligned with a strategy of insurgency; they mainly target security forces with the goal of controlling territory and governing. Jihadists target security forces using a variety of means, including ambushes, base raids, and the use of improvised explosive devices. By increasing the human and resource costs of holding territory, they compel security forces to limit their activities or pull out altogether. For example, there are hardly any security forces present in the problematic tri-border area of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger anymore. Since 2014, jihadists have avoided large-scale, conventional battles for control of population centers. However, this does not mean they are satisfied with controlling mostly rural areas. Rather, they besiege the centers to gradually pressure and delegitimize security forces at little cost to themselves. JNIM has done this in Timbuktu since August 2023, while ISSP has done so in Menaka since May 2023. They are taking a lower-risk, long-term approach; their goal is to drive out security forces and persuade a weary population to accept their governance. In areas that jihadist groups control or contest, they move quickly to establish forms of governance. Their activities include levying taxes, regulating and controlling businesses, operating courts, and providing services like education and healthcare. Because many areas did not have effective or any government presence, civilians often view jihadist groups as more just and effective than the government. Most terrorist attacks are meant to coerce civilians or undermine the government in localities jihadist groups control or hope to control. JNIM targets events, offices, schools, and infrastructure if it believes the target is in violation of its Islamist beliefs. It also targets civilians suspected of collaborating with the government. JNIM balances governance by fear with localized governance; it wants to be perceived as a just, responsive governing entity by civilians. In practice, this consists of co-opting local leaders and promoting cohesion between ethnic groups by arbitrating disputes. In exchange, they adhere to broader JNIM directives. This arrangement helps JNIM’s recruitment because it is viewed as a protector of marginalized groups. ISSP relies on governance by fear, coercing civilians to adhere to its maximalist Islamist beliefs. This is done through public demonstrations of force, including executions and amputations. The emphasis on force has attracted Fulanis seeking reprisals against ethnic militias, including those affiliated with the Dogon and Mossi. Jihadists have also conducted traditional terrorist attacks in the Sahel and coastal West Africa, including bombing hotels frequented by Westerners. This contributes to their goal of eliminating Western influence because it intimidates Westerners and related businesses. It also draws attention to the worldwide cause of their parent organizations, al-Qaeda and ISIS. More attention can attract more recruits and fundraising. However, jihadist groups are not relying on terrorist attacks to overthrow Sahelian governments or induce concessions to establish an Islamist state. That is what their insurgencies are intended to do. Significance These escalating insurgencies pose a threat to several actors, chiefly Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. They have ceded substantial territory to jihadists and do not control swaths of their countries. The deteriorating situation has caused economic hardship in the already underdeveloped countries, along with forced displacement, human rights violations, and increasing violence around population centers. It has also contributed to political instability; each country has experienced military coups at least partially inspired by the perception that the government cannot provide security. As jihadists take control of key roads, capitals are now under threat of attack and siege. If the insurgencies continue gaining strength at their current rate, they will be positioned to force the government out of population centers. This would render these countries collapsed states and allow jihadist groups to establish an Islamist state. Thus, the insurgencies encompass the key sectors of Sahelian countries: security, governance, and development. The insurgencies also pose an increasing transnational threat, particularly to countries in West Africa. Jihadist groups are not just interested in the Sahel; JNIM has expanded its activity to Benin, Togo, and Côte D’Ivoire. JNIM and ISSP have recruited militants from these countries, as well as Ghana, Mauritania, and Senegal, by appealing to ethnic groups like the Fulani. Jihadist groups spread the message that they protect marginalized groups through targeted media campaigns beyond the Sahel. Because other West African countries share challenges with their Sahelian neighbors—ethnic tensions, ineffective governance, underdevelopment—jihadist groups might be able to export their insurgencies if they continue to grow stronger in the Sahel. They have stated their intention to do so and will likely take advantage of any openings. In addition, Europe, the United States, and the international community are at risk. Terrorist attacks outside of the Sahel can benefit al-Qaeda and ISIS, to which JNIM and ISSP have allegiance despite their local focus. These Sahelian jihadist groups have threatened terrorist attacks on Western countries in the past and want to eliminate Western influence from West Africa, where attacks against Western assets and personnel have already been conducted. As jihadist groups control more territory, they have more resources at their disposal. This allows them to enhance their training, logistical capacity, and ability to conduct external attacks. Foreign militants have been traveling to the Sahel to train and fight with jihadist groups, especially ISSP. This is consistent with other Islamic State provinces like ISIS-Khorasan that have used their territory to train foreign militants to conduct external attacks. Because many foreign militants in the Sahel are from countries with established migration and smuggling routes to Europe, this is a clear threat. Moreover, the inability of the United States to control its southern border has attracted migrants from West Africa. Jihadists are involved in migration and smuggling routes, which increases the risk of militants infiltrating the United States. In conclusion, escalating jihadist insurgencies threaten to take control of Sahelian countries and destabilize West Africa. Their success only benefits worldwide al-Qaeda and Islamic State fundraising, recruitment, and operations. Counterterrorism Strategies To address the insurgencies, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have employed a strategy of counterterrorism. Of the three counterterrorism strategies a government can pursue—repression, decapitation, and persuasion—they have tried each simultaneously. However, they have relied on repression and decapitation, employing security forces to clear areas and kill and capture terrorists, especially the leaders. They have inconsistently employed persuasion, which can involve negotiations to reduce violence or to demobilize and splinter groups. It can also consist of policy measures to address drivers of terrorist activity, including lack of economic opportunity. One reason Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have failed to stop jihadists is because their counterterrorism strategy is unaligned with the reality of the insurgencies. It is not only a war of killing and capturing jihadists; it is a war of securing the population and providing effective governance to address the drivers of the insurgencies. Counterterrorism in Mali Mali has largely relied on the same approach since the proto-caliphate in northern Mali was overthrown in 2014, despite the consolidation and escalation of the insurgencies. From 2013 to 2014, Malian and French security forces waged conventional warfare to regain control of population centers. Jihadists had established a government but failed to defend it against Malian and French conventional weapons and tactics. They scattered to ungoverned spaces, especially in cross-border areas, from which they employed a strategy of terrorism for multiple years. In collaboration with Mali and other Sahelian countries, France rolled out Operation Barkhane in 2014 to hunt remnants of jihadist groups. Therefore, Mali pursued a strategy of repression and decapitation. Malian and French security forces, which combined to number 35,000–40,000 members, conducted raids and gathered intelligence to target jihadist leaders. Their aim was to disrupt jihadist groups with kill or capture operations so they could not reconstitute. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), which consisted of 15,000 troops from a variety of African, Asian, and European countries, patrolled major roads and population centers to secure areas. The G5 Sahel Joint Force was formed between Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Mauritania in 2014 to conduct operations in cross-border areas. The counterterrorism strategy achieved tactical successes such as the killing of some senior leaders, but it did not prevent the reconstitution of jihadist groups. By 2016, they had transitioned from ungoverned spaces to more densely populated areas to launch insurgencies. Mali did not respond by overhauling its counterterrorism strategy or waging counterinsurgency. It doubled down on repression by allowing self-interested militias to conduct unsupervised operations against suspected jihadists, leading to ethnic reprisals. Excluding hostage release talks, Mali did not take any steps to negotiate with jihadist groups beyond declaring its openness to dialogue. In fact, it excluded them from the 2015 Algiers Accords, which ended the civil war. The insurgencies continued intensifying, as attacks and deaths of civilians and security forces rose sharply. Eventually, the military’s dissatisfaction over the escalating insurgencies combined with governance shortcomings to spur military coups in 2020 and 2021. However, the ruling junta’s policy changes have been reducing international support and intensifying repression. It removed Operation Barkhane and MINUSMA forces and pulled out of the G5 Sahel. The junta has repositioned units to the capital to consolidate its authority. What it lacks in manpower, it tries to make up for in coercion. The junta has significantly increased indiscriminate targeting during counterterrorism operations, negatively affecting civilians. The junta’s acceptance of a Wagner Group contingent has compounded this trend. The contingent of one thousand mercenaries conducts counterterrorism operations alongside Malian security forces. Four out of five people killed in Wagner operations have been civilians. This includes a March 2022 massacre in which Wagner and Malian security forces killed over five hundred civilians in central Mali. In 2022, Wagner and Malian security forces were responsible for 40 percent of violent civilian deaths. Intensified repression has coincided with strengthening insurgencies. Mali’s approach has failed because it is a counterterrorism strategy rather than a counterinsurgency one. Counterterrorism operations may subdue high-value targets or clear areas temporarily, but Malian and partner security forces have not held areas or prevented jihadist groups from regrouping. Consequently, jihadists have regrouped in ungoverned spaces after being pushed out of population centers. This is due to both manpower restraints over a vast geographic area and ineffective strategy. Counterterrorism operations are not coupled with efforts to establish effective governance, especially in rural areas. The same factors that contributed to the outbreak of the Malian civil war—ethnic marginalization and lack of basic services—remain unaddressed. Security force abuses have reinforced civilians’ belief that the government cannot protect its population. Jihadist groups have thereby sustained their insurgencies among a population distrustful of the government and susceptible to jihadist recruitment. Counterterrorism in Burkina Faso In response to the insurgencies, Burkina Faso has escalated its approach, although it still does not reflect a strategy of counterinsurgency. Unlike in Mali, insurgencies in Burkina Faso did not become an urgent security threat until 2018. This coincided with JNIM’s consolidation and ISSP’s emergence. Up to that point, Burkina Faso relied on Operation Barkhane forces, the G5 Sahel Joint Force, and U.S. military aid to decapitate jihadist groups and undertake limited repression through raids. Its security forces were small, consisting of roughly ten thousand members. As jihadists began infiltrating northern Burkina Faso from central Mali, Burkinabé security forces increased their presence in the affected provinces. By the end of 2019, though, deaths due to the insurgencies had increased over 700 percent from the previous year. Burkina Faso responded by forming a militia called Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (Volontaires pour la défense de la patrie, or VDP). The VDP is supposed to train and arm civilians of all ethnicities to defend their localities alongside traditional security forces. They are used for more than defense, however, also conducting offensive operations like raids. While the VDP is supposed to be inclusive, it has systematically excluded Fulani due to paranoia about their potential ties to jihadists. The VDP’s formation is representative of a shift toward widespread repression, as it mobilized the entire country to fight jihadists. Burkina Faso did allow localities to pursue short-term ceasefires with jihadist groups in 2020–21, which contributed to short-term reductions in violence. However, authorities did not renew these ceasefires, and the insurgencies have substantially worsened since. The deteriorating security situation added to preexisting dissatisfaction over government corruption and ineffectiveness to cause two military coups in 2022. The ruling junta has responded similarly to Mali’s, reducing international support and intensifying repression. It removed Operation Barkhane forces and pulled out of the G5 Sahel in 2023. To consolidate its authority, the junta repositioned units from northern and eastern regions that were fighting jihadists to the capital. To address the manpower deficit, the junta has relied more on the VDP and drones. The VDP has increased its ranks by roughly 50,000 militiamen, who collect intelligence and conduct raids and ambushes. The junta purchased drones from Turkey in 2022 and used them to attack suspected jihadists in areas inaccessible to security forces. Along with indiscriminate targeting during counterterrorism operations, these factors have caused a substantial number of civilian deaths. Symbolic of the junta’s intensified repression, an Africa Corps contingent of one hundred mercenaries representing the rebranded Wagner Group arrived in January 2024. While intensified repression has achieved limited tactical successes in killing and capturing jihadists and defending some localities, the insurgencies continue to escalate. Burkina Faso’s approach has failed because it has prioritized counterterrorism operations over addressing the drivers of the insurgencies. The insurgencies are not happening because Burkina Faso is failing to kill and capture enough jihadists; they spilled over from Mali due to the marginalization of ethnic groups like the Fulani and a lack of governance. Vulnerable civilians view jihadist groups as protectors who provide justice and services. Security force abuses and an anemic government presence in the tri-border area with Mali and Niger further this perception. While the junta has incorporated limited counterinsurgency by tasking the VDP with helping to hold areas, a lack of oversight and resources hampers the efforts. Consequently, they are not enough to close security and governance gaps that jihadists exploit. The short-term benefits of drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations will not make up for the governance deficit in the long term. Counterterrorism in Niger Niger is an outlier when compared to Mali and Burkina Faso, as it used a multi-faceted counterterrorism approach with some counterinsurgency methods to contain the insurgencies. Only after a military coup caused more by infighting than insecurity did Niger’s approach mirror Mali’s and Burkina Faso’s. This has coincided with worsening insurgencies. Until the fall of 2023, the insurgencies in Niger were at a relatively steady state. While there was a notable amount of jihadist activity in the tri-border area with Mali and Burkina Faso, it was mostly contained. Niger had employed a strategy of decapitation and limited repression. Niger benefitted from France’s reallocation of troops after their removal from Mali and Burkina Faso. Alongside the G5 Sahel Joint Force and several thousand Operation Barkhane and U.S. troops, Niger used its roughly 35,000 to 40,000 security force members to target jihadist leaders and conduct disciplined raids. Niger’s robust security force presence prevented the insurgencies from expanding beyond its tri-border regions. When combined with persuasion, this strategy helped Niger temporarily avoid the significant escalation experienced by Mali and Burkina Faso. The biggest difference between Niger and the other two countries was its use of persuasion to reduce violence and demobilize jihadists. When former President Mohamed Bazoum took office in 2021, he facilitated negotiations with jihadist groups. His administration conducted local outreach to identify what jihadists want as well as their vulnerabilities. Bazoum proved his credibility by releasing reformed jihadist leaders from prison and meeting with them to address their concerns. This counterinsurgency method was included in the government’s broader counterterrorism strategy, as it tried to be more accountable and responsive. The most substantive dialogue was geared toward jihadists’ demobilization. Rather than punish former jihadists, the government set up facilities to deradicalize them. After completing this process, they were given employment resources to assist with their reintegration into society. Bazoum also appointed a peace minister to settle the ethnic tensions that jihadists often exploit to recruit. As a result, the Fulani and Zarma ethnic groups signed a local peace agreement in western Niger. Niger’s approach of targeted counterterrorism operations and negotiations paid dividends, as jihadist activity in the first half of 2023 reached its lowest levels since 2018. Despite a positive security outlook, the population and security forces had dealt with jihadist activity for several years by July 2023. While political infighting was the primary cause of that month’s military coup, dissatisfaction with the government’s inability to completely stop the insurgencies helped justify it. The ruling junta has used this dissatisfaction to change its strategy using the same playbook as Mali and Burkina Faso: reduced international support, intensified repression, and stalled negotiations with jihadist groups. It removed Operation Barkhane and U.S. forces and pulled out of the G5 Sahel. It repositioned units combatting jihadists to the capital to consolidate its authority. Negotiations have been set aside in favor of counterterrorism operations with indiscriminate targeting, negatively affecting civilians. The junta has increased its use of airstrikes, which has resulted in civilian deaths on multiple occasions. Militias outlawed by former President Bazoum due to ethnic reprisals are now operating without oversight. In another sign of intensifying repression, a Wagner Africa Corps contingent of one hundred mercenaries arrived in April 2024. In a stark contrast to the pre-coup security situation, JNIM and ISSP have exponentially increased their activity and gained territory near the capital. Niger’s pre-coup approach was a limited success, while its post-coup approach is a failure. Its pre-coup approach recognized the drivers of the insurgencies. Its robust security force presence in Western regions limited the ungoverned spaces jihadists could exploit. Along with pursuing official dialogue to reduce ethnic tensions, this provided security for the population. In addition, Niger created a framework to demobilize and deradicalize jihadists. Its steps toward accountable, responsive governance disrupted jihadist activity and recruitment. However, long-standing shortcomings in infrastructure and other services left the population disillusioned, which helps explain the military coup. Its post-coup approach has ignored and, in some cases, worsened the drivers of the insurgencies. Niger has prioritized undisciplined counterterrorism operations over a robust security force presence, reduction of ethnic tensions, and demobilization of jihadists. This has given jihadist groups an opening to recruit from a marginalized and underserved population and gain territory. Policy Recommendations If Sahelian governments are to weaken jihadist insurgencies, they must revise their strategy to reflect counterinsurgency methods. Their policy objectives should not be jihadist-centric, such as killing and capturing as many jihadists as possible. Rather, their objectives should be population-centric, focused on securing localities and improving governance. That their populations perceive jihadist groups as, in some cases, providing better security and governance shows the extent of their shortcomings. The population must be convinced that the government can protect them and serve their interests. If this happens, localities will be resilient to jihadist incursions and recruitment. Recommendation #1. Prioritize clearing and holding operations over raids and high-value targets. To secure the population, Sahelian governments must enhance their security force presence to limit ungoverned spaces and jihadist territorial control. Under the current counterterrorism strategies of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, the emphasis is on targeting jihadist leaders and clearing areas with raids. Because jihadist groups have adopted a strategy of insurgency rather than terrorism, these operations are insufficient. Security forces are moving from one operation to the next, allowing jihadists to regroup and return to areas that were recently cleared. The only way to prevent this is by holding territory with a consistent security force presence, reflecting a strategy of counterinsurgency. This can be accomplished through security force augmentation. Whether it is military, law enforcement, or, if necessary, militias, security forces need more people to secure ungoverned spaces, especially the tri-border area. In 2023, Mali and Burkina Faso spent approximately 4 percent of their gross domestic product on military expenditures, while Niger spent approximately 2 percent. For countries that are unsuccessfully fighting for their survival, this is not enough. They should maximize their military expenditures, prioritizing personnel and training over conventional weaponry like artillery and aircraft. This type of weaponry is not as useful for combatting insurgencies, and only trained personnel can hold territory. Sahelian countries have long struggled with inexperienced and unmotivated security forces, making it vital to properly pay and train them. If increased expenditures and prioritization do not field enough security force members, governments should employ militias. Militias are more cost-effective than traditional security forces because their members are not full-time security professionals. However, militias come with the risks of ineffectiveness and abuses against civilians. Because jihadist groups exploit ethnic tensions and abuses against civilians to recruit, militias must be inclusive and unbiased. Therefore, they should be integrated into the government’s security forces, similar to the VDP in Burkina Faso but with more oversight. Integration will allow governments to provide training, arms, and oversight. At least one military officer should be deployed to oversee each localities’ militiamen. Given their controversial track record with offensive operations, militias must be employed exclusively for defensive purposes. They can collect intelligence and share it with traditional security forces, who will then act on it. To deny jihadists territory, governments must shift from prioritizing counterterrorism operations to counterinsurgency ones. If jihadist groups cannot control territory or thrive in ungoverned spaces, they will no longer be able to wage insurgencies. Recommendation #2. Expand cooperation with international partners. Another way Sahelian governments should augment their security forces is with international partnerships. Because vast swaths of territory need to be cleared and held, the more security forces, the better. The best bet for partnerships is between the Sahelian countries themselves. The newly formed Association of Sahelian States—consisting of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger—should stand up a joint military force. It can be used to stabilize the problematic tri-border area shared by the three countries. By pooling their resources, they can make up for their individual shortcomings. They should also attempt to convince Chad and Mauritania to join, as all these countries worked together on counterterrorism in the G5 Sahel. Chad and Mauritania have been more effective than Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger in securing their borders and conducting anti-jihadist operations. If possible, Sahelian countries should partner with the United Nations and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). While a United Nations partnership is unlikely given Mali’s removal of MINUSMA, a decision Burkina Faso and Niger approved of, it would add needed manpower. The same goes for ECOWAS given Sahelian countries’ withdrawal from the regional bloc. However, ECOWAS has recently conducted outreach to convince them to rejoin. They should respond favorably and prioritize rejoining because the insurgencies threaten ECOWAS member countries as well. This might make the bloc more likely to provide security assistance. In addition, Sahelian countries should seek partnerships with Western countries, which have vast financial and logistical capabilities as well as experience in the Sahel and Afghanistan. Western countries are also concerned about the threat jihadists pose to their interests and homelands. However, the complicating factor is that each Sahelian country has already terminated partnerships with some Western countries. Therefore, international partnerships between the Sahelian countries should be prioritized to increase their capacity to hold territory and secure their populations. Recommendation #3. Enhance governance, particularly in rural areas. Once localities are more secure, Sahelian governments must increase their presence, especially in rural areas vulnerable to jihadist incursions. The insurgencies exploit governance gaps to appeal to marginalized ethnic groups and underserved populations. Governments must challenge the narrative that jihadist groups provide more effective governance in these communities. This involves bolstering local services and the justice system. Governments should co-opt local leaders as liaisons between localities and the government. Liaisons will engage with the population to evaluate needs and report back to the government. Governments will complement liaisons’ efforts by establishing multiple outposts in each of their regions. These outposts will be manned by government representatives, who will use information from liaisons to satisfy local needs. Liaisons should also ensure the justice system is arbitrating disputes, particularly ethnic tensions. This initiative is cost-effective because it co-opts local leaders without sending representatives to every locality. It replaces marginalization with representation, improving the population’s perception of the government. The population will be less likely to tolerate, let alone join, jihadist groups if it believes the government treats them fairly and serves their needs. Recommendation #4. Pursue negotiations to demobilize jihadists and ease ethnic tensions. Improving security and governance will address the drivers of the insurgencies, opening an opportunity for negotiation. Using Niger’s former approach, Sahelian governments should open an official office within a ministry that handles negotiations, ethnic disputes, and demobilization. Government sponsorship increases the legitimacy of dialogue. Negotiations should not cede territory to jihadists; they want to replace the current state with an Islamist one, and territorial control furthers that cause. However, negotiations should offer amnesty to jihadists willing to go through a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration process. This process requires that demobilization facilities complete with employment assistance be established in each region. Governments should seek funding and assistance from the United Nations, which has an office dedicated to disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration. In addition, governments should facilitate dialogue between feuding ethnic groups, using civil society and religious leaders as mediators. By reducing ethnic tensions, governments will deprive jihadists of a key recruitment tool. Moreover, sponsoring negotiations for the purpose of demobilization will deprive jihadist groups of the members they need to wage insurgencies. Recommendation #5. Stop paying to release hostages. Sahelian governments should make the difficult decision to stop ransom payments because they are a primary source of funding for jihadist groups. Payments help fund their insurgencies in the present and incentivize future kidnappings. Not only should governments not partake in ransom payments, but they also should implement laws preventing private citizens from doing so. If foreigners try to make payments, Sahelian governments should protest through diplomatic channels. They can justify this policy by pointing to the severity of the security situation and the transnational threat it poses. Governments have direct control over a key source of funding for destabilizing insurgencies, so they should immediately cut it. Conclusion Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger must align their security strategy with their security situation. The situation is deteriorating, as jihadist insurgencies claim more land and encircle population centers. Meanwhile, the governments are pursuing tactical counterterrorism victories using means incompatible with strategic counterinsurgency victory. The only way they can prevail is by addressing the drivers of the insurgencies. The population needs security and governance, both of which are currently absent. Therefore, governments must be more present, accountable, and responsive to win the trust of the population. Only security and governance will prevent jihadists from controlling territory, thereby restoring stability in Sahel and reducing the transnational threat. If Sahelian countries fail to do so, the insurgencies will likely pose progressively larger threats in the Sahel, West Africa, and the international community, particularly Western countries.

Asian Democracies In Doubt About DeepSeek – Analysis	By Seth Hays The release of China’s DeepSeek R1 generative AI model, purportedly built on significantly less computing power and money than comparable models, made headlines across the world. While much discussion is focused on how this moves US–China AI competition, the rest of Asia is assessing the impact of this new player on their AI governance and industrial policies from practical and rights-based perspectives. Examining policy moves by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in response to DeepSeek shows the importance of AI governance. Particularly in the areas of privacy protection and national security, AI governance is necessary for a successful cross-border AI industry to thrive in Asia and positioning these countries to take advantage of industry volatility. South Korea’s Personal Information Privacy Commission suspended the use of DeepSeek in South Korea due to concerns about the company’s collection and processing of personal data. The privacy regulator indicated that DeepSeek expressed its interest in actively cooperating with the authorities by appointing a local agent. South Korea’s approach has been balanced in that it noted that the deficiencies can be remedied and the services restored after improvements are made. It cited similar concerns that were raised by US-based AI services, such as OpenAI and Google AI services. South Korea is not favouring US-based AI over China’s tech sector, despite being a US ally, and privacy rules for AI companies are applied in a geopolitically non-discriminatory way. But the government’s actions do underscore the important role that AI governance will play in the country’s AI sector. This follows the passage of South Korea’s AI Basic Act, which contains provisions on AI governance, such as requirements for transparency, accountability and a risk-based tiered system of regulation. Such legislation is aligned with the growing international consensus on trustworthy AI, such as the OECD framework. At the same time, it promotes industrial policy to foster the AI industry at home and support the creation of more data centres, accessible training data and education for AI talent. In Taiwan, the Ministry of Digital Affairs imposed a moratorium on the use of DeepSeek in the public sector, citing national security concerns about data leakage. The concerns are bolstered by reports that DeepSeek spouts Chinese Communist Party propaganda regarding the status of Taiwan as an independent democratic society. Though Taiwan has blocked other Chinese apps from being used by the public sector, its overall policy regarding AI and algorithmic technology from China has been based on principles supporting freedom of speech and access to technology. Taiwan has not blocked TikTok, despite concerns from civil society that the app could be used to manipulate public opinion or spread disinformation. Taiwan also expects to pass an AI Basic Act, which will institutionalise the need for AI governance processes to adhere to international standards on trust, accountability and transparency. In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has taken note of the implications of DeepSeek’s release as a reason to continue moving towards the passage of an AI Basic Act. He said that legislation on AI, expected to come in 2025, should boost the technology while minimising risks and dangers. Tokyo banned the use of DeepSeek on government devices, as did numerous companies, citing data security and privacy concerns. Should the claims about DeepSeek’s compute intensity be accurate — and doubts exist about the very low price tag — this also spells an opportunity for many countries in Asia to enter the AI race without access to the advanced chips available in larger economies. But the moral of the DeepSeek story is that ignoring AI governance, including data security and privacy concerns, is not a recipe for long-term success. Countries that foster trustworthy AI, respect privacy and data protection and do not have objectionable political bias will be able to compete long-term across borders. Policies that ensure data and AI governance rules are interoperable will be key for building internationally competitive AI. Japan has led the way in developing rules for data free flow with trust at multilateral venues, such as APEC and the OECD. South Korea has taken the lead in global AI governance discussions. In 2024, it hosted the second iteration of the AI Safety Summit and the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Conference. Taiwan’s importance to global AI efforts cannot be understated, given that it produces the vast majority of the world’s advanced chips. The current administration has emphasised the importance of Taiwan to the ‘Democratic Supply Chain’. Taiwan is also considering an AI Basic Act to foster responsible AI development and use. With the right policies, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are well positioned to boost their domestic AI industries, despite regional volatility and geopolitical tension between the United States and China. As low-cost providers like DeepSeek continue to pick up steam, AI governance — complemented by rational infrastructure inputs — is crucial for a democratic AI supply chain.

Trump’s Tariff Policy And The Fragility Of The US Economy – Analy...	By Wei Hongxu Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump has once again brought up the issue of tariffs. He announced that starting in March, he would impose a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico. Additionally, he stated that tariffs on Chinese imports would increase by another 10%, bringing the total tariff on Chinese goods to 20%. This move has caused the capital markets, which had previously relaxed after Trump delayed tariff hikes, to become tense once again. It has also triggered a ripple effect in international markets. How will Trump's tariff policy impact the economy? What is the outlook for the U.S. economy? These questions are once again raising concerns and uncertainties in the market. In reality, whether Trump delayed tariffs as he did earlier or reinstated and increased them now, tariffs remain a political tool for him. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated not long ago that the Trump administration 'was working to bolster the private sector's contribution to job creation, partly by slashing regulations, extending tax cuts and rebalancing the U.S. economy through tariff policies'. In this context, tariff policy can be seen as one of the key pillars of Trump's 'Make America Great Again' agenda. Of course, this is different from Trump's earlier focus on restoring trade balance in the U.S. In this new phase, the flexibility of tariffs targets a broader range of goals, including revitalizing the economy, encouraging investment to return, reducing the budget deficit, and more. Tariff policy is now intertwined with issues like immigration, investment, and the war on drugs, demonstrating its flexibility. However, this also increases the uncertainty surrounding the policy. Tariffs may be delayed or reduced if certain goals are met, or they may be increased if other issues worsen. This is why Trump's tariff policy seems to be in a constant state of flux, which is also why the market feels so confused. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policy is closely tied to the evolving structural contradictions within the U.S. economy and society. A senior researcher at ANBOUND has previously pointed out that Trump's obsession with the trade war is driven by three main factors. First, the geopolitical tools available to him are not very effective, with tariffs being one of the few easily usable options. Second, based on the theory of 'buyer-seller market imbalance' (2010, ANBOUND), Trump firmly believes that being the 'buyer', he has the upper hand. Third, Trump views the impact on inflation as limited, hoping to leverage the external effects of tariffs to resolve internal contradictions within the U.S. economy. In this sense, the fluctuation of Trump's tariff policy is closely tied to the current economic situation in the U.S., and this is also leading to the increasing politicization of the American economy. After a period of sustained prosperity during the Biden administration, the U.S. economy is increasingly showing signs of sluggish growth. The latest data reveals that the U.S. real GDP annualized quarterly growth rate for the fourth quarter of last year was 2.3%, unchanged from the initial estimate. However, compared to previous quarters, it indicates a continued slowdown. Following a 2.8% growth in 2024, the latest forecasts show that U.S. GDP will grow by just 2.3% this year, as slowing job growth has dampened consumer demand. Data from January shows a 0.2% decline in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), and after adjusting for inflation, real PCE fell by 0.5%, marking the largest monthly decline in nearly four years. These figures suggest that, after the retreat of 'Bidenomics', Trump 2.0 faces increasing challenges in maintaining sustained economic growth in the U.S. In fact, the senior researcher at ANBOUND has been warning about the fragility of the U.S. economy as early as 2024. Especially concerning employment and inflation, it has been pointed out that one should not only look at the seemingly impressive overall data to analyze and understand the issues within the U.S. economy, which is far from as healthy as the data suggests. The new U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent has recently acknowledged that the underlying vulnerability of the U.S. economy is much greater than what the economic indicators show. He pointed out that while U.S. GDP growth is strong and unemployment is low, factors like interest rate volatility, sticky inflation, and job growth heavily reliant on the public sector are hindering economic development. Bessent attributed 'sticky inflation' primarily to the excessive government spending and regulatory barriers that occurred under former President Biden’s leadership. He said, 'The previous administration's over-reliance on excessive government spending and overbearing regulation left us with an economy that may have exhibited some reasonable metrics but ultimately was brittle underneath'. He also highlighted that, over the past 12 months, 95% of job growth has been concentrated in public and government-related sectors, such as healthcare and education, where wages grow more slowly and productivity is lower compared to the private sector. At the same time, employment in manufacturing, metals, mining, and information technology sectors has shrunk or stagnated during the same period. 'The private sector has been in recession', Bessent said. 'Our goal is to re-privatize the economy'. What Bessent said is not merely a political attack against the Biden administration. According to official statistics, in 2024, the total non-farm employment in the U.S. exceeded 159 million people, an increase of 2.32 million from 2023. However, the main contributors to job growth were concentrated in five sectors: education and healthcare, government, trade and transportation, leisure and hospitality, and infrastructure. Together, these sectors accounted for more than 2.1 million new jobs. The sector with the most significant growth was education and healthcare, which added 970,000 jobs over the year. In contrast, the manufacturing sector saw a decline. In 2024, manufacturing employment dropped by 87,000, with 24,000 of those jobs lost in computer and electronics manufacturing. Even more puzzling is that, despite the surge in AI investment, the information services sector saw a decrease of 8,000 jobs. This might be one of the reasons why Silicon Valley has seen increasing support for Trump. This structural shift in employment raises questions about whether the Biden administration might have 'played it smart' by increasing public sector jobs, especially temporary positions, to boost employment figures. In this regard, the highly 'politicized' employment policies of the Biden administration, while pushing various indicators towards an impression of 'prosperity', have also deepened the structural contradictions in U.S. employment and economic performance. The ongoing decline in manufacturing and the job losses it brings have, in fact, boosted support for Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' campaign. This can be seen as a key factor contributing to his potential return to power. Therefore, it is natural for Trump in his '2.0' phase to focus on using his economic policies to win over voters. For Trump, promoting the return of manufacturing through tariff barriers not only helps reduce the trade deficit but also creates jobs, serving as a crucial method for transforming the U.S. economic structure. Previously, when meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump emphasized that he wanted to impose 'comprehensive tariffs' to achieve the goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. It was not just Apple. Trump had similar plans for pharmaceutical industry giants as well. According to insiders, Trump had met privately with the CEOs of companies like Eli Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer, warning them that tariffs were coming and urging these companies to shift their overseas production back to the U.S. It should be noted that the Biden administration's approach of increasing public sector jobs is also one of the reasons why U.S. inflation has been slow to ease. The latest data shows that the U.S. January PCE price index rose by 2.5% year-over-year. While this meets expectations and is a slight decrease from the 2.6% reported in December, the month-on-month inflation level has risen again. The January PCE price index increased by 0.3% compared to December, matching the previous month's increase. Inflation in the services sector remains high. In January, core service prices, excluding housing and energy, increased by 0.2% month-on-month, while goods prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.4%, marking the largest monthly increase since early 2023. The overall core inflation, excluding estimated prices, which the Federal Reserve has particularly focused on in recent months, also rose by 0.2% in January. Given that Trump had just taken office in January, the persistent inflation in January is less likely to be attributed to the 'threat' of Trump's tariff policies and more to what Trump himself would call the 'Biden effect'. This is closely related to the Fed's decision last year to lower interest rates despite inflation's persistence. Trump had repeatedly criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for making 'inappropriate' rate cuts, which he argued were aimed at helping Biden's re-election campaign. Trump's overwhelming victory last year was largely attributed to how 'Bidenomics' during the Biden administration fueled inflation in the U.S. To address inflation, Trump will undoubtedly continue to use political means, adjusting both economic and trade structures as part of his broader strategy. Importantly, for Trump, the impact of tariff policies on inflation carries a lot of uncertainties. In particular, he hopes to reduce fiscal spending and the deficit through new departments under Elon Musk, which could help ease inflationary pressure. This would also lead to cuts in public sector jobs, which could suppress demand. Apollo Global Management has pointed out that layoffs related to efficiency measures in government departments could reach 300,000, and when including affected contractors, the total number of job losses could approach 1 million. The firm is concerned that in the short term, the economy and markets could face downside risks. This 'counterattack' against the Biden administration will certainly have an impact on inflation and consumer demand. It will also bring changes to employment and economic structures, aligning with Bessent's goal of boosting private sector growth. In this context, whether it is through tax cuts, spending reductions, or tariff increases, these policies are essentially part of a broader fiscal tightening process, leading to an overall reduction in the fiscal deficit. Tariffs may play a role in balancing the effects between tax cuts and spending reductions. Therefore, the level of tariffs not only reflects changes in trade and employment but also depends on inflationary trends, fiscal balance, and the state of the fiscal deficit. Final analysis conclusion: While 'Bidenomics' brought prosperity to the U.S. economy, it also led to an increasingly fragile economic structure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the underlying vulnerability of the U.S. economy is greater than what the economic indicators show. The Trump administration is working to strengthen the private sector’s contribution to job creation, with measures including regulatory cuts, extending tax cuts, and using tariff policies to rebalance the U.S. economy. This means that in the future, Trump’s economic policies will become increasingly politically driven, with tariffs serving as one of the tools to achieve his political goals.

How Indonesian Textile Giant Sritex Collapsed – Analysis	By Arie Firdaus What began as a small fabric shop in Central Java nearly 60 years ago grew into one of Southeast Asia’s biggest textile manufacturers, outfitting military forces and supplying clothing to major global retailers. But on March 1, the Sritex factory floors in Solo (Surakarta) fell silent. The company, brought down by mounting debts and a court-declared bankruptcy, officially ceased operations, leaving more than 10,000 workers jobless, Many of them had spent their entire careers at Sritex. The collapse marks one of the largest industrial shutdowns in Indonesia’s recent history, raising concerns about the fate of the nation’s textile sector, a key driver of its economy. How did Sritex become a textile giant? The Sritex journey began in 1966 when Muhammad Lukminto opened a small shop in Solo. By 1968, the business had expanded into textile production, and by 1978, had become a limited liability company, according to the company’s website. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Sritex evolved into a vertically integrated textile manufacturer. That meant it controlled stages of production in turning raw materials into finished goods. During this time, it became the official supplier of uniforms for the Indonesian Armed Forces before securing contracts with the German military and NATO. The company also produced garments for retailers such as Walmart, Sears, H&M, Uniqlo and Zara. By 2019, Sritex had reached annual sales of U.S. $1.3 billion (21.1 trillion rupiah) What led to Sritex’s financial collapse? Sritex’s troubles began in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and weakened consumer demand. Sales plummeted to $847 million (13.7 trillion rupiah), leading to the company’s first recorded loss since going public, according to its financial reports. By mid-2024, Sritex’s total obligations had ballooned to $1.6 billion (26.2 trillion rupiah), nearly double its 2019 debt level. Despite reaching a temporary debt restructuring deal in 2022, creditors lost confidence. Last October, creditor PT Indo Bharat Rayon filed for Sritex bankruptcy, arguing the company had failed to meet its debt obligations. The court ruled in favor of Indo Bharat Rayon and Indonesia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision in December, making the bankruptcy legally binding. What happened to the workers? In the first two months of 2025, at least 10,665 employees lost their jobs across Sritex Group’s four factories in Central Java. Labor unions have expressed concerns about the timing of the shutdown, which occurred as the Ramadan fasting month began in Indonesia. Many workers suspect this was a strategy to avoid paying Eid al-Fitr bonuses. 'We’re asking: Is this a way to deny us our rightful bonuses?' said Slamet Kaswanto, head of the Sritex Workers’ Union, during a parliamentary hearing. Meanwhile, the Indonesian government has pledged to assist affected workers, with the Ministry of Manpower working to ensure that severance payments and unemployment benefits are disbursed. Did the government try to intervene? Sritex’s collapse drew national attention, prompting President Prabowo Subianto’s new administration to consider intervention. In late 2024, the government assigned four ministries, including the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, to explore rescue options. Despite these efforts, the bankruptcy ruling led to mass layoffs. The government has since shifted its focus toward reemploying former Sritex workers, with officials claiming that new investors are interested in leasing Sritex’s equipment to restart production. Does this signal a decline in Indonesia’s textile industry? Sritex is not the only textile company struggling. Between 2019 and mid-2024, at least 36 Indonesian textile firms shut down, including PT Pismatex, a company that had operated since 1972, according to the Confederation of Nusantara Trade Unions (KSPN). In the first half of 2024 alone, 10 textile companies laid off nearly 14,000 workers, the union said. Bhima Yudhistira, director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), blamed the weakening of Indonesia’s manufacturing competitiveness on high costs, inconsistent government policies and rising interest rates. Additionally, Indonesia has struggled to compete with countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, which offer lower production costs to attract major global fashion brands, he said. Jemmy Kartiwa Sastraatmadja, chairman of the Indonesian Textile Association (API), said trade protection policies implemented by several countries to limit exports to major textile producers such as China had led to overstocked inventories. 'As a result, the surplus is being exported to countries with weak trade protection policies, such as Indonesia,' Jemmy told BenarNews. In January, Redma Gita Wirawasta, who chairs the Indonesian Filament Yarn and Fiber Producers Association, told journalists that Indonesian factories have struggled to compete with cheap clothing from China flooding the market. What are the economic consequences? Sritex’s downfall is expected to have a ripple effect on Indonesia’s economy beyond its former employees. CELIOS estimates the bankruptcy could reduce Indonesia’s national GDP by 0.1% and cut regional GDP in areas where Sritex operated by 0.5%. Investor confidence in Indonesia’s textile sector is also likely to suffer, potentially discouraging future foreign investment, the think-tank said. Is Indonesia facing deindustrialization? Sritex’s bankruptcy highlights a broader issue – the steady decline of Indonesia’s manufacturing sector. Since 2010, manufacturing’s share of the GDP gradually shrank to where it remained below 20% between 2019 and 2024, according to government data – a figure that worries analysts. The government must increase the manufacturing sector’s contribution to 25% of Indonesia’s GDP to achieve its economic growth target of 8%, said Marco Kamiya, the U.N. Industrial Development Organization’s (UNIDO) representative for Indonesia. 'The manufacturing sector must be a key focus if Indonesia aims to achieve its ‘Golden Indonesia 2045’ vision,' Kamiya told an economic forum last month, referring to the government’s goal of Indonesia becoming a high-income country by its centennial.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyLQZXxa8ebAa	2025-03-07T18:36:31-08:00	
The Hidden Cost Of Tariffs: A Lesson From Bastiat’s Seen And Unse...	By Richard Martin Tariffs are often portrayed as a simple solution to protect domestic industries and create jobs. Politicians, like Trump, have used them as a political tool, promising immediate benefits through reduced competition and increased domestic production. However, this narrative overlooks the fundamental economic lesson articulated by Frédéric Bastiat in his principle of the seen and the unseen. When applied to tariffs, this lesson reveals the hidden and long-term damage that protectionist policies can inflict on an economy. For Canada, reacting to US tariffs with retaliation would only amplify the problem—instead, Canada must adopt a strategy that maximizes economic freedom and embraces structural reform. What Is Bastiat’s Principle of the Seen and Unseen? In his famous essay That Which Is Seen, and What Is Not Seen, Bastiat argued that economic decisions produce both immediate, visible effects (what is seen) and hidden, long-term effects (what is unseen). Policymakers often focus on the seen—the direct benefits of a policy—without accounting for the cascading, often negative, effects that remain hidden until it’s too late. When it comes to tariffs, the seen effect is easy to understand. Higher prices on foreign goods are supposed to encourage consumers to buy domestic products, thereby protecting local industries and jobs. But what is unseen? The answer lies in the broader, long-term impacts on productivity, the structure of production, trade relationships, and economic growth. The Seen: Temporary Protection for Domestic Industries When tariffs are imposed, domestic producers initially benefit. By making imported goods more expensive, tariffs give local industries a competitive advantage in the short term. Politicians highlight this benefit as evidence that tariffs 'work' to protect jobs and boost domestic production. However, this temporary protection comes at a significant cost. The Unseen: Long-Term Damage to the Economy Higher Costs for Consumers and Businesses: Tariffs act as a tax on consumers, who are forced to pay higher prices for imported goods or their domestic substitutes. What remains unseen is the cumulative effect on household budgets and reduced spending in other areas of the economy. Businesses that rely on imported materials or components face higher input costs, making them less competitive domestically and internationally. Disrupted Supply Chains: Modern production processes, especially in industries like automotive and manufacturing, involve complex cross-border supply chains. A single car, for example, may cross the US-Canada border multiple times during its production. When tariffs are applied at each crossing, the costs escalate quickly, making final products more expensive and less competitive. The unseen effect is the cascading disruption of entire industries that depend on smooth, tariff-free supply chains. Retaliation and Trade Wars: Tariffs rarely exist in isolation. When one country imposes tariffs, trading partners often retaliate, leading to a downward spiral of reduced trade. Canada experienced this firsthand during the Smoot-Hawley era of the 1930s, when global retaliation to US tariffs contributed to a 60 percent decline in world trade. The unseen damage includes lost export opportunities, reduced foreign investment, and weakened trade relationships. Reduced Productivity and Innovation: Protectionist policies shield domestic industries from competition, reducing the incentive to innovate or improve efficiency. Over time, this leads to stagnation and declining productivity. What remains unseen is the opportunity cost: the lost growth that could have been achieved through free competition and exposure to global markets. Long-Term Structural Damage: As tariffs distort market incentives, resources are allocated inefficiently. Industries that may not be competitive without protection receive an artificial boost, while more efficient sectors suffer from reduced investment. The unseen consequence is long-term structural weakness, making the economy more vulnerable to external shocks. Canada’s Strategic Response: Embracing Economic Freedom Trump’s tariff threats, particularly against Canada, are part of a broader strategy of economic nationalism. While retaliating may seem like a natural response and provides a certain emotional satisfaction, it would exacerbate the unseen damage by deepening the economic dislocation caused by protectionist policies. Instead of retaliating, Canada should take the opportunity to address long-standing structural issues that have limited its economic potential. Here’s how: Lower All Tariffs and Trade Barriers Globally: By unilaterally lowering tariffs, Canada can reduce costs for consumers and businesses, making its industries more competitive. This approach also signals a commitment to free trade, attracting international investment. Eliminate Interprovincial Trade Barriers: Canada’s internal barriers to trade are a major drag on productivity. Removing these barriers would allow for the free flow of goods, services, and labor, unlocking significant economic growth. Encourage Investment by Eliminating the Capital Gains Tax: The capital gains tax discourages long-term investment and entrepreneurship. Eliminating it would unlock capital, fuel innovation, and drive economic diversification. Repeal Restrictions on Resource Development: Canada’s vast natural resources are a key economic advantage, but restrictive regulations have limited their development. Removing these obstacles would boost exports, create jobs, and reduce dependence on the US market. Diversify Trade Relationships: Expanding trade agreements with Europe, Asia, and emerging markets would reduce Canada’s reliance on the US and open new opportunities for growth. Conclusion: Long-Term Prosperity and Resilience Through Economic Freedom Bastiat’s lesson of the seen and unseen reminds us that the true cost of protectionism lies beyond what is immediately visible. By focusing on short-term benefits, countries risk long-term economic stagnation and structural damage. For Canada (and America and all nations), the path forward is clear: embrace maximum economic freedom, lower trade barriers, and implement structural reforms that unleash productivity and innovation. Instead of reacting to protectionist threats, Canada can lead by example—creating a resilient, globally-competitive economy that thrives on free trade and open markets.

President Trump’s Shout-Out To The Military-Industrial Complex – ...	President Donald Trump’s efforts, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and otherwise, to reduce United States government spending is the focus of much attention. Indeed, in his speech Tuesday night in the US Capitol, Trump listed several expenditures his administration had uncovered that he categorized as 'appalling waste.' He also declared that his administration would balance the budget, something he noted had not been accomplished in 24 years. It was thus peculiar that Trump slipped into his over hour and a half speech a shout-out to one of the groups most notorious for involvement in massive spending by the United States government — the military-industrial complex. The shout-out, though, was likely not understood by most people. This is because Trump did not use the term 'military industrial complex.' The term 'military-industrial complex' was first used by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his farewell speech in the context of a warning to the American people. 'In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex,' declared Eisenhower on January 17, 1961. Continuing, Eisenhower warned that this military-industrial complex threatened to 'endanger our liberties or democratic processes.' Over the decades since, the term has been regularly used by other individuals who have warned, like Eisenhower did, against this particularly dangerous and expensive public-private venture. Instead of stating 'military-industrial complex,' Trump used the more public relations approved substitute term of 'defense industrial base.' Declared Trump: To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact. And Trump’s proclaimed effort to boost the military-industrial complex goes beyond starting a vast program for shipbuilding. Just preceding these shipbuilding comments, Trump declared his commitment to pursuing another huge program through the military-industrial complex: As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state of the art 'golden dome' missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A. Trump did in his Tuesday night speech mention Eisenhower approvingly. But, Trump talked only about Eisenhower’s effort as president to deport people from America. Hopefully, Trump will further consider Eisenhower’s presidency and heed the warning about the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower offered. In the meantime, beneficiaries of the military-industrial complex will be anticipating ocean-spanning and sky-high profit.

Russia Scrambling To Cope With Mounting Shortage Of Policemen – O...	Russia is a police state with an unusual problem: it doesn't have enough policemen to man the front lines. As a result, it is using police from foreign countries, relying on ethnic militias, employing CCTV to track people, and shifting police from one region of the country to another to fill gaps. Russian policemen have been leaving the service to get higher pay by fighting in Ukraine or joining private security companies, with units in many parts of the country short of staff by as much as a third. And now the problem has become so critical, given rising crime rates, that it has attracted the attention of Vladimir Putin. The interior ministry began sounding the alarm on this point at the end of last year (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/11/russia-facing-increasingly-serious.html), and now Putin has added his voice to complaints but without any suggestion that he will spend more money on the country's police force or has any long-term plans (vkrizis.info/vlast/nekomplekt-vnutrennih-del/). Among the steps the Russian government has taken to dry to deal with this problem without spending more money, something very difficult at a time of budgetary stringency brought on by Putin's war in Ukraine, are the following: -- Bringing in police from Central Asian countries (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/12/to-cope-with-enormous-shortage-of.html and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/12/to-cope-with-enormous-shortage-of.html); -- Shifting police from one region to another as needed, including from those dominated by one ethnic group to those dominated by another (fortanga.org/2025/03/otryad-policzii-iz-udmurtii-polgoda-budet-rabotat-na-dorogah-ingushetii/); -- Relying on non-Russian ethnic units as well as on the notorious Black Hundreds-type Russian nationalist Russian Community to perform basic policing functions and engage in crowd control (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/11/spread-of-immigrant-militia-units-in.html and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/10/another-black-hundreds-group-revived-in.html); -- Turning to the Russian army and other security forces to perform basic police functions (vkrizis.info/vlast/nekomplekt-vnutrennih-del/); and -- Increasingly relying on electronic means such as CCTV to monitor what Russians are doing at lower cost (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/02/another-move-toward-new-totalitarianism.html).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyBn6CWnESyXZ	2025-03-07T18:10:06-08:00	
Trump’s Dead People On Social Security Lie – OpEd	Donald Trump told many lies in his address to Congress the other night, but the one I found especially galling was when he repeated the absurd claim that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security benefits. My anger probably is part due to the fact that I spent many years studying and defending the program. Part of the story is that I look to soon be getting benefits from the program myself. But a big part of the story is that it is just such an obvious lie. It is infuriating to see Trump keep repeating it and then have all his MAGA cronies nod their heads like it somehow makes sense. There have been extensive analyses of the problem of people continuing to get checks after they are dead by the Social Security Administration (SSA) itself. It does happen occasionally, largely because families often don’t contact the SSA immediately after a person has died. But in almost all cases, the checks are stopped a month or two after death and most of the money paid out is returned. The biggest obstacle to ensuring that payments don’t go to dead people is that we don’t have a centralized national death registry. The reason we don’t have such a system is that Republicans would block it as an intrusion of the deep state. So, in keeping with that great Republican tradition, they blame the government for a problem they themselves created. But we don’t need to trust the work done by the SSA or outside investigators to know that millions of dead people are not getting Social Security. As I showed a few weeks back, we just need to trust arithmetic. Mr. Arithmetic Shows Donald Trump is Lying The basis point is very simple. The SSA gives us very good data on the number of people getting benefits by age, as well as their average benefit. We can add that up (even the 'super high IQ' DOGE boys should be able to do this) and calculate how much Social Security is paying out to people who are alive, or at least who are at ages where we expect them to be alive. When we add up the numbers, we find that the payments we can identify as going to living people come out to be pretty much exactly the amount of spending in the budget reported for Social Security. In other words, there is no room for the checks that are supposedly going to millions of dead people. Let me try to explain this point so that even Donald Trump might be able to understand. The SSA can identify real living people getting Social Security benefits. They also know how much money they get in benefits. We can check the SSA data against other sources. The Census gives us good data on how many people are in each group. For example, we can use the Census data to see how many people in the country are between ages 70 to 74 or 75 to 79. We can see that these data pretty much align with how many people SSA tells us are getting benefits in these age groups. We also know roughly how much these people should be getting in benefits. Social Security has a well-defined benefit formula, so we know roughly what we would expect an average 75-year-old or 80-year-old to be getting in benefits. There are also surveys that tell us how much people report getting in Social Security benefits each year. We could see if SSA was putting out obviously bogus numbers for the average benefit size. This means that we can be fairly confident that the SSA numbers on the total number of living people getting benefits are close to the mark. We also can be fairly confident that the number they are reporting for the amount of benefits they are getting is close to the mark. Since this total is equal to the amount of money that the government reports it pays out for Social Security each year, there is no room for the benefits going to Donald Trump’s millions of dead people. And just to be clear, there is no room for a hidden pool of money being paid to dead people. If there were hundreds of billions of dollars of unreported payments, they wouldn’t be in the budget by definition – they are unreported. So, Elon Musk, the DOGE boys, and Donald Trump would not be finding fraud in the budget. They would then be claiming that the government is making hundreds of billions in payments that no one knows about, and the deficit is far larger than anyone realized. Maybe this somehow makes sense in Trump World, but it is getting outside the bounds even allowed for the Twilight Zone. Repeating the Social Security Zombie Lie Given its obvious absurdity, the repetition of the lie about Social Security zombies has the same function as asserting the 2020 election was stolen or that Ukraine started the war with Russia. It’s Trump asserting the right to create his own reality in obvious defiance of the facts. It speaks volumes about the Republican Party that almost all of them are willing to go along with this obvious lie. Unfortunately, the media have largely given in at this point. The fact that Trump would tell an outlandish lie about the country’s most important social program, on which tens of millions of people depend for their livelihood, is barely even news. This originally appeared on Dean Baker’s Beat the Press blog.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyI1Zni5pjlPY	2025-03-07T18:04:14-08:00	
Ukraine Forced To Saudi Talks With Fewer Cards Than Ever – Analys...	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine is a recalcitrant mule that’s been smashed on the nose with a plank of wood. This colorful image is a paraphrase of a telling remark this week by US special envoy Keith Kellogg that sums up Washington’s view of Ukraine’s rocky road from the bust-up in the White House to new talks with US negotiators in Saudi Arabia. Kellogg was discussing the US decision to pause military supplies to Ukraine and suspend intelligence cooperation. The aim, he said, was to compel Ukraine to join talks. 'The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose,' Kellogg said. 'You got their attention.' In other words, Ukraine’s biggest military backer has wielded a big stick to get its way, and it seems to have worked. 'The push is to get them to engage in diplomatic activities.... The bottom line is that it’s a forcing function to get them to the table,' Kellogg said at an event in Washington on March 6. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads to Riyadh on March 10 to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, followed by talks between Ukrainian and US delegations in Jeddah later in the week. This view of the dynamic of the last few days, and where it now leaves Ukraine, was shared by one analyst who spoke to RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service on March 7. 'They decided to put pressure on the weakest party,' said Yevhen Mahda, a Ukrainian political scientist and director of Kyiv's Institute of World Policy. 'The United States is not just turning the world order upside down. They are demonstrating, you know, a kind of caricature of policy,' Mahda said. The bitterness in these words echoes that heard in comments made by Ukraine’s ambassador to London, Valeriy Zaluzhniy, who this week accused the United States of 'destroying' the rules-based international order. Nevertheless, the presence of Ukrainian negotiators in Jeddah next week suggests that officials in Kyiv have accepted they have -- right now -- few options. Or, as US President Donald Trump put it, few cards. Zelenskyy’s tone of contrition in recent days also speaks to this. 'Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable,' he tweeted on March 4. 'I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership.' Kellogg was sitting right behind US Vice President JD Vance and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when the Oval Office meeting blew up. 'I had a ringside seat,' he said, adding that Zelenskyy 'misread the room.' 'You don’t try to challenge the president of the United States in the Oval Office.' While Kellogg’s mule quote made some headlines, his other comments offer further insight into how Washington wants things to go from here. A key first step will be to sign the minerals deal that was supposed to be signed in Washington. 'That is a big deal for us because President Trump is a transactional leader, and transactional starts with economics,' he said. Kellogg suggested -- in broad brush rather than in detail -- that this would be followed by Ukrainian officials setting out their 'term sheet' of basic positions. He said Russia had already done this. 'Do we have a term sheet from the Russians broadly? Do we have a term sheet with the Ukrainians? The answer is yes and no.' Mahda, the Ukrainian analyst, complained that Trump was not putting any kind of pressure at all on Russia, 'despite the fact that Ukraine is fighting a war for its independence.' On March 7, Trump took to Truth Social to wave some kind of stick at Russia, too. 'I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,' he wrote. 'To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.' This framing of the situation as two sides with equal status is clearly painful for Ukrainians. But Zelenskyy’s attempt to persuade Trump that his country, as the victim of aggression, has a moral case for support appears to have fallen on deaf ears. Kellogg said that, instead of acting as Ukraine’s ally, Washington would play 'an objective interlocutor role.' The fear in Kyiv and many other European capitals is that Washington is not even going to do this. Rather, that it sees its own interests as aligned with Moscow’s. This perception has driven European efforts this week to bolster its own defense capabilities. Zelenskyy appeared genuinely moved by European expressions of support and solidarity at meetings in London and Brussels in recent days. Alongside the now traditional mantra of sticking with Ukraine for as long as it takes, there were announcements that British and French intelligence would try to fill the gap left by the Americans. But the reality is that this is second-best assistance. It can help Ukraine hold the line for a time, but it cannot quickly replace the kind of US backing Ukraine has had until now. 'We have to understand that European equivalents of (US-made) Patriot missiles…won’t come quickly, by waving a magic wand,' said Mahda. Ray Furlong is a Senior International Correspondent for RFE/RL.

Cutlass Express Highlights Partnership At Sea	The threats of terrorism, piracy, smuggling and trafficking in East Africa loomed over Exercise Cutlass Express, which urged more than 1,000 participants from 20 nations to forge closer ties in the Western Indian Ocean. Participants trained to expand their capacity and capability for multinational maritime security operations throughout the 15th iteration of the event. Sponsored by U.S. Africa Command and facilitated by the U.S. 6th Fleet, it took place from February 10 to 21 in Mauritius, the Seychelles and Tanzania. Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Mhona, chief of Training and Combat Readiness for the Tanzania People’s Defence Force (TPDF), said the event emphasized the need for regional, continental and international collaboration. 'When we talk about terrorism, human trafficking and cybercrime, these are global issues,' he said during the closing ceremony on February 21. 'Since we share similar challenges, it is imperative that we tackle them together. However, effective collaboration is only possible if we train together. Interoperability is a fundamental aspect of our preparedness.' Comoros, Djibouti, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, Somalia and Tunisia were among the other African nations participating in Cutlass Express 2025, where Tanzania reinforced its role as a regional leader in addressing transnational maritime challenges with multilateral coordination. Two national maritime operation centers in Tanzania took part in exercises to collaborate on real-time scenarios linked to visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) training in Tanga. 'We value the TPDF’s role as a regional leader in deploying peacekeeping forces, countering violent extremist organizations and promoting maritime security,' Andrew Lentz, chargé d’affaires ad interim of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania, said during the closing ceremony. 'Through exercises like Cutlass Express, we are building the readiness of our militaries and deepening the bilateral and multilateral relationships required to confront today’s most complex security challenges.' In the Seychelles, a weeklong rule of law course allowed participants to share and refine tactics for interdiction operations and for holding malign actors accountable for crimes at sea. 'Ensuring the free flow of commerce within the region, especially over critical sea lines of communication and the vast expanse of this maritime environment, is vital to the economic stability and security of the region,' U.S. Navy Rear Adm. David E. Ludwa said. Exercise Cutlass Express 2025 linked up with Exercise Justified Accord, which also took place in Tanzania, to improve coordination between land- and sea-based operations. 'This exercise was important for fostering cooperation to address global security challenges,' Mhona said. '[It] was designed to involve multiple nations because the challenges we face in Africa are the same as those encountered in other parts of the world.' AFRICOM Deputy Commander Lt. Gen. John Brennan underscored Tanzania’s significance. 'Tanzania is one of our strategic partners, not only in East Africa but across the entire continent, one of our most valued partnerships,' he said. The event featured a number of satisfied participants, including Seychelles Defence Forces Lance Cpl. Kenny Vidot, who relished his role as an instructor in the VBSS trainings in Tanzania. He said 12 of his Seychellois colleagues participated in the same exercise in Mauritius. '[We are] training to support collaborative maritime security operations in the region,' he said on February 14. 'This exercise is important for us to increase maritime capabilities and to promote regional cooperation in the Indian Ocean.' The VBSS training in Port Louis, Mauritius, on February 19 was an important experience for Mozambican 2nd Lt. Jose Chitengo. 'Cutlass Express has been good, and we are learning a lot,' he said. 'All of it was very positive knowledge. I believe it will be useful to apply these practices in my country.' After the VBSS training, Kenyan Senior Pvt. Faith Gitonha called the event 'a unique opportunity for hands-on learning.' 'It is so fascinating to see the variations in how different countries tackle a similar challenge. It has really emphasized teamwork, and that helps build a diverse set of skills. I feel more equipped to tackle multinational military challenges.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyKqp4F6L4sFw	2025-03-07T17:57:52-08:00	
China Warns US Against Containment As Trump’s Second Term Reshape...	By Taejun Kang and Alan Lu No country should expect to suppress China and maintain good relations with it, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday, as he warned of a reaction if the United States tried to contain his country. But in response to questions about U.S. relations as President Donald Trump begins his second term, Wang also held out the prospect of a successful partnership between the world’s two biggest economies. 'No country should fantasize that it can suppress China and maintain a good relationship with China at the same time,' Wang told a news conference on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary meeting in Beijing. 'Such two-faced acts are not good for the stability of bilateral relations or for building mutual trust.' The United States has imposed tariffs of 20% on Chinese goods since Trump took office – 10% last month and a further 10% coming into effect on Tuesday. Trump imposed the tariffs in retaliation for what he says is China’s refusal to stop the outflow of precursors for the synthetic opioid fentanyl. U.S. officials blame fentanyl for tens of thousands of deaths each year. China moved swiftly to retaliate with tariffs of its own on American agricultural and food products while accusing the United States of 'bullying.' Wang said the U.S. should reassess its policies, particularly on tariffs. He also dismissed U.S. criticism over fentanyl, describing it as a domestic issue that the U.S. must confront internally. The U.S. 'should not repay kindness with grievances, let alone impose tariffs without reason,' he said, adding that China had provided the United States with 'various assistance' to tackle the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs into the U.S. 'If one side blindly exerts pressure, China will resolutely counter that,' Wang said. Wang warned of the 'law of the jungle' in international relations if powerful countries bullied smaller ones. 'Small and weak countries will get burned first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock,' he said. 'Major countries should undertake their international obligations … and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.' He said China welcomed more countries into a 'community of a shared future.' 'History proves that the only way to be a real winner is to care for everyone,' he added. ‘Playing with fire’ On broader U.S.-China relations, Wang denounced 'unjustified external suppression' of China’s technology sector and reiterated Beijing’s opposition to Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy. Wang called on the U.S. to foster 'positive and pragmatic cooperation and dialogue,' while emphasizing that mutual respect remained the foundation of U.S.-China ties, and their economic and trade ties were interdependent. 'The two countries can be partners that contribute to each other’s success,' he said. Wang held out the prospect of good ties with the European Union as well, noting that annual China-EU trade has grown to US$780 billion. 'We also believe that Europe can be a reliable partner. Both sides have the ability and wisdom to properly handle existing issues through friendly consultations,' he said. Wang reaffirmed Beijing’s position on self-ruled Taiwan and accused outside powers of fueling instability, adding that anyone supporting Taiwan’s independence would get burned. 'Taiwan has never been a country; it was not in the past, and it will never be in the future,' he said, warning that 'allowing Taiwan independence undermines stability in the Taiwan Strait.' Wang further criticized 'external support' for the island’s independence. 'Supporting Taiwan independence is playing with fire,' he said. On the war in Ukraine, Wang repeated China’s stance of support for political negotiations to end a conflict that he said 'could have been avoided.' 'China has been advocating for peace talks since the first day of the crisis,' he said. 'All parties should learn something from the crisis,' he said. 'Among many other things, security should be mutual and equal, and no country should build its security on the insecurity of another,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyNEgazzIRWOq	2025-03-07T17:53:06-08:00	
Poland: Tusk Plans To Offer Military Training To All Polish Men	By Nicoletta Ionta (EurActiv) -- Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced plans to encourage military training for every adult man in Poland in a speech on Friday, with a model outlining how to stand up the expanded military training expected by the end of 2025. The goal, according to Tusk, is to make sure that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war and that Poland has military reserves 'adequate to potential threats'. He added that women would also have the option to participate in the training. Tusk said that 'work is on the way' to ensure all Polish men receive military training in a speech on Friday to the Sejm, the lower house of Poland's parliament. He did not provide details of how the training scheme would work, but suggested that it would be voluntary. E'very healthy man should want to train to be able to defend the homeland if necessary,' Tusk said. However, Tusk dismissed concerns about a return to compulsory military service. 'If I had proposed a return to basic service, I would have said so,' he stated. Tusk highlighted the growing military imbalance in the region, noting that Ukraine's army stands at 800,000 troops, while Russia fields 1.3 million soldiers. Given these numbers, he Poland’s need to strengthen its defence, said Tusk. 'We are talking about the need for a 500,000-strong Polish army, including reservists,' he stated. Poland's military currently has more than 200,000 soldiers, with ambitions to continue growing in size. The country ended conscription in 2008. Tusk's remarks came after returning from Thursday's EU summit in Brussels to discuss needed investments in European defence, where all 27 EU leaders agreed to move forward on a European Commission plan for €150 billion in defence spending, although there was fierce debate ensued over financing for additional military funding. 'Today in Europe, we are setting an example of how to act rationally, pragmatically, without cosseting, without rushing into unnecessary conflicts,' Tusk said in Warsaw on Friday. Despite Poland’s push for stronger defense capabilities, Warsaw has remained firm on excluding troop deployments to Ukraine, even as part of a possible peacekeeping mission. 'Poland's task is to guard its eastern border, which is also the border of Nato and the European Union,' Tusk affirmed. Also on Friday, Katarzyna Pelczynska-Nalecz, the Polish minister responsible for development and regional policy, announced that Poland will be reallocating 30 billion zlotys (€7.2 billion) from its recovery fund to a different pot for security and defence. The fund will support civil defence, dual-use projects, shelters, roads, and defence industry research and development. Talks with the European Commission are in the final stages, with more reallocations toward defence expected, Pelczynska-Nalecz said. 'A very serious race awaits us. And this is a race for security, not a race to war,' Tusk said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyHQLtH_1CJh_	2025-03-07T17:47:01-08:00	
Trump Confirms Direct Talks With Hamas	By Patsy Widakuswara President Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed that his administration was negotiating with Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, to free the remaining hostages, and he doubled down on his earlier ultimatum that there would be 'hell to pay' in Gaza if they were not released immediately. 'You’re going to find out,' Trump said from the Oval Office when asked by a reporter what he meant. Trump highlighted his Wednesday meeting with freed Israeli hostages. 'I had the honor of spending a lot of time yesterday with quite a few of the people that we got out, and I can't believe how badly treated they were,' he said. Earlier Thursday, Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters at the White House there could be 'some action taken' by the administration that could be done 'jointly with the Israelis.' 'Hamas has an opportunity to act reasonably, to do what's right, and then to walk out,' Witkoff said, referring to U.S. and Israeli demands that Hamas not have any military or political role in postwar Gaza. Neither Trump nor the White House responded to queries on whether the options being considered would include military action. In the past, officials have said they will not send American troops to Gaza. Trump’s decision to begin direct talks with Hamas to release hostages, led by special envoy for hostages Adam Boehler, marks a departure from Washington’s long-standing policy to not negotiate with terrorists. 'We are helping Israel in those discussions, because we're talking about Israeli hostages. And we're not doing anything in terms of Hamas. We're not giving cash,' Trump said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that Israel 'has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas.' Hamas said the best path to free the hostages was through ceasefire negotiations. It added that threats from Trump were encouraging Israel to walk away from the multiphase Gaza ceasefire deal reached on Jan. 19, a day before Trump took office. 'The language of threats does not intimidate us; it only complicates matters further,' Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in a statement posted on a Telegram channel affiliated with the group. Wednesday on Truth Social, Trump posted, 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you. ... I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.' His administration sent $4 billion in weapons to Israel this week, the second time in a month it bypassed congressional approval for sending arms to the country. The U.S.-Hamas talks appear to be a new diplomatic track, separate from ongoing negotiations between Hamas and Israel, with mediation by Qatar and the U.S., to secure phase two of the Gaza ceasefire. Hamas accused the U.S. and Israel of trying to back out of negotiations as phase one ended last weekend. 'Most people are expecting the ceasefire will collapse because they are expecting that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to start pounding Gaza again,' said Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'And as soon as that happens, there will be no more hostage releases,' she told VOA. Arab counterproposal In addition to the two negotiation tracks, Arab nations on Tuesday endorsed a counterproposal to Trump’s call to expel Palestinians and turn Gaza into a beach destination. Under the Arab plan, Palestinians will remain there, and Hamas will be excluded from governance. Israel has rejected the plan, but Washington sees it as a 'good-faith first step,' Witkoff said in response to VOA’s question during a gathering of reporters at the White House on Thursday. 'We're evaluating everything there. So, it's a little bit early to comment,' he said. Israel has also blocked all aid into Gaza since Sunday, repeating long-standing charges that it is being diverted to Hamas, which international agencies deny. There’s now a fuel shortage in the territory, further jeopardizing basic services such as trash removal. The war in Gaza began with the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and resulted in about 250 people being taken hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 48,400 Palestinians, about half being women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyBsJh51FAnYE	2025-03-07T17:43:21-08:00	
Brazil: Economy Grows 3.4% In 2024, Highest Rise Since 2021	By Bruno de Freitas Moura The Brazilian economy grew by 3.4 percent in 2024, marking the largest expansion since 2021. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the total value of goods and services produced in the country, was released on Friday morning (Mar. 7) by the government´s statistics agency IBGE. The result represents the fourth consecutive year of growth. According to IBGE, Brazil's GDP totaled BRL 11.7 trillion. The services and industrial sectors pushed GDP up, with increases of 3.7 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, compared to 2023. In contrast, agriculture and livestock production declined by 3.2 percent. Growth in recent years: 2020 (start of the pandemic): -3,3% 2021: 4,8% 2022: 3% 2023: 3,2% 2024: 3,4% GDP can be calculated from either the production perspective (analyzing the performance of economic activities) or the consumption perspective (examining spending and investments). On the production side, IBGE points out that three segments were responsible for approximately half of GDP growth in 2024: - Other service activities (5.3%) - Manufacturing (3.8%) - Trade (3.8%) Specifically within industry, the highlight was construction, up 4.3 percent. Agriculture and livestock production declined after growing by 16.3 percent in 2023. The downturn was largely due to various climatic factors that affected key crops, with soybeans (-4.6%) and corn (-12.5%) being particularly impacted. Consumption On the consumption side, household consumption was the standout, growing by 4.8 percent. According to Rebeca Palis, coordinator of the IBGE's National Accounts, this increase is attributed to the greater availability of income for the population. 'For household consumption, we saw a favorable combination of factors, including government income transfer programs, continued improvement in the job market, and interest rates that were, on average, lower than in 2023,' Palis explains. Brazil ended 2024 with an unemployment rate of 6.6 percent, the lowest ever recorded. Fourth quarter In the fourth quarter, the economy expanded by 0.2 percent, reflecting considerable stability. According to Palis, one reason for the modest growth in the final three months of the year was inflation and the rise in interest rates—measures implemented by the Central Bank to curb price increases, but which had a dampening effect on economic activity. 'In the fourth quarter of 2024, what stands out is that GDP remained almost stable, with growth in investments but a decline in household consumption. This was due to a slight acceleration in inflation, particularly food prices,' says Palis. GDP per capita, calculated by dividing GDP by the population, reached BRL 55,247.45, marking a 3 percent increase compared to 2023, after adjusting for inflation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyPNkVyX-PEsM	2025-03-07T17:39:11-08:00	
The Egyptian Plan Has Become Arab … What Next? – OpEd	By Dr. Abdellatif El-Menawy The emergency Arab summit, held in Cairo on Tuesday, aimed to discuss ways to rebuild Gaza and address the ongoing repercussions of the war there. The summit witnessed a unified Arab stance against attempts to displace Palestinians, while emphasizing the two-state solution as the main path to achieving peace and stability in the region. One of the most significant outcomes of the summit was the adoption of the Egyptian plan for the reconstruction of Gaza, a proposal that spans five years and has an estimated cost of $53 billion. The plan focuses on rebuilding infrastructure, providing housing solutions for displaced Palestinians within the territory, empowering the Palestinian Authority to govern and removing Hamas from power. Additionally, it includes the formation of a 'Gaza Administration Committee,' a nonpartisan body comprising 15 Palestinian technocrats to manage daily affairs during the first six months of recovery. The plan is divided into three phases. The first phase involves clearing rubble and establishing temporary housing for approximately 1.5 million Palestinians. The second phase transitions to constructing new housing units, an airport, a seaport and economic and tourism projects. The final phase aims to pave the way for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state through direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis under international supervision. The plan faces significant challenges, as US President Donald Trump’s administration has expressed reservations about its security and political aspects, particularly concerning governance in Gaza and the future of Hamas. Meanwhile, Trump is promoting an alternative plan that involves relocating Palestinians from Gaza and transforming the sector into a luxurious tourist destination — an idea that was strongly rejected by the Arab summit. US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff further fueled concerns by stating that Israel demands Hamas be excluded from any future governance and disarmed as a prerequisite for reconstruction, a condition Hamas considers a 'red line.' Despite US and Israeli pressure, Arab nations have leverage they can use to support the Egyptian plan, including diplomatic relations with Israel and the normalization agreements signed in recent years. Analysts suggest that presenting a comprehensive vision that entices Washington — such as involving American companies in reconstruction projects and linking the plan to the normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations — could push Trump toward supporting the Arab initiative. At the end of the summit, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi announced that Cairo would host an international conference on Gaza reconstruction in April to secure the necessary funding and coordinate contributions from donor countries. This conference is seen as a test of the Arab world’s ability to rally international support for the reconstruction initiative. The key question remains: Can the Arab nations succeed in this endeavor? The implementation of Egypt’s Gaza reconstruction plan and the outcomes of the emergency summit largely depend on the position taken by the US administration—whether it chooses to support the plan or continues backing Israel’s efforts to obstruct its execution, especially given the fragile ceasefire agreement, which remains at risk of collapse. A joint Egyptian-Arab delegation is scheduled to visit Washington next week to meet with Trump administration officials, lawmakers in Congress and key decision-making centers to present the plan and persuade the US to support it. This visit will be followed by trips to European capitals. Trump’s stance has fluctuated between insisting that his plan to relocate Palestinians and develop luxury resorts in Gaza is the most viable and implementable solution and a softer message that he would not impose his ideas on anyone. Trump reinforced his position in a video created using artificial intelligence, which he shared on his Truth Social platform, reaffirming his vision of transforming Gaza into a high-end tourist destination. While the summit was taking place in Cairo, the US State Department announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reaffirm the US’ unwavering support for Israel as a top priority for the Trump administration. During the call, Rubio pledged to expedite the delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel. In return, Netanyahu expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of Witkoff in efforts to free hostages and extend the ceasefire in Gaza. While the Trump administration is open to considering the Egyptian plan, it has many questions regarding governance in Gaza, postwar security management and the potential involvement of international peacekeeping forces in both Gaza and the West Bank. Additionally, the US has concerns about disarming Hamas and minimizing its role, as the group remains the dominant force in Gaza. Arab nations worry about the continued US support for Israel, the uncertainty surrounding the durability of the ceasefire and Israeli actions in the West Bank, including the forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians. These concerns are compounded by fears that Israel is exploiting the US’ backing to advance its plan to annex the West Bank. There is growing concern that Washington might support Israel’s conditions that exclude both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority from any future governance in Gaza. Israel is also pushing for the extension of the ceasefire’s initial phase, securing hostage releases without committing to withdrawing its forces from Gaza. Last month, Witkoff stated in an interview with CBS News that one of Washington’s firm stances on Gaza’s future was the removal of Hamas from the territory. Egyptian officials acknowledge the difficulty of disarming Palestinian factions in Gaza, meaning they face challenges in persuading donors to fund reconstruction, given concerns that Israel might resume bombing the sector even after significant investments in rebuilding homes and infrastructure. The fragile nature of the ceasefire further amplifies these concerns. However, if Trump perceives that endorsing the Arab plan could bolster his image as a peacemaker and potentially secure him a Nobel Peace Prize, he might be more inclined to support it. To succeed, Arab nations must win over American public opinion and pressure the Trump administration to push Israel toward maintaining the ceasefire and accepting a peace plan. Some experts argue that the best hope lies in Trump losing patience with Netanyahu, who might jeopardize part of the US president’s regional strategy and complicate efforts to secure hostage releases. If Trump manages to broker a major diplomatic breakthrough — securing the release of hostages, ensuring peace in Gaza without Hamas and expanding the Abraham Accords to include more Arab and Muslim nations — he could claim a significant foreign policy victory. The Arab summit firmly rejected Trump’s proposal to relocate more than 2 million Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan while transforming Gaza into a 'Middle Eastern Riviera.' Instead, Cairo presented a phased reconstruction plan aimed at keeping Palestinians in Gaza, removing Hamas from governance and ultimately restoring PA control. During the first phase of the Egyptian proposal, direct negotiations between Israel and Palestinian representatives would begin, addressing final-status issues such as territorial borders and the status of Jerusalem. The plan also includes Egypt and Jordan training a Palestinian police force to maintain security. The Egyptian plan reaffirms the two-state solution, warning that any attempt to undermine Palestinian statehood will fuel further conflict and instability. However, Israel’s hard-line stance against Hamas and right-wing opposition to a Palestinian state raise doubts about its commitment to peace talks.

Trump Says Letter Sent To Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei About New Dea...	US President Donald Trump said he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and sent a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei on Thursday, claiming he hoped they would agree to talk. 'I said I hope you're going to negotiate, because it's going to be a lot better for Iran,' Trump said in the interview with Fox Business Network broadcast Friday. 'I think they want to get that letter. The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let another nuclear weapon,' the US president said, Reuters reported. The letter appeared to have been addressed to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei. The White House did not immediately respond to a request about that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyEvBjkOTU-k-	2025-03-07T17:28:40-08:00	
Vatican Expresses Solidarity With Muslims During Ramadan Fast	By Hannah Brockhaus The Vatican has expressed its solidarity with Muslims participating in the Ramadan fast, noting that Catholics also fast and do penance during the season of Lent and inviting greater dialogue and friendship between people of the two religions. 'Our world is thirsting for fraternity and genuine dialogue,' a March 7 message from the Vatican’s Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue said. 'Together, Muslims and Christians can bear witness to this hope in the conviction that friendship is possible despite the burden of history and ideologies that promote exclusion.' 'Hope,' it continued, 'is no mere optimism: It is a virtue rooted in faith in God, the Merciful, our Creator.' In 2025, Ramadan runs from approximately Feb. 28 to March 29. It concludes with the three-day celebration of Eid al-Fitr. The Christian season of Lent began on March 5 and will end on April 17 with the three days known as the Triduum — Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday — followed by Easter Sunday. 'This year, Ramadan largely coincides with Lent, which for Christians is a period of fasting, supplication, and conversion to Christ,' the dicastery said. 'This proximity in the spiritual calendar offers us a unique opportunity to walk side by side, Christians and Muslims, in a common process of purification, prayer, and charity.' The Vatican’s annual message for Ramadan was signed by the dicastery’s new prefect, Cardinal George Jacob Koovakad, and its secretary, Father Indunil Janakaratne Kodithuwakku Kankanamalage. Pope Francis appointed Koovakad prefect of the dicastery at the end of January, filling the vacancy left by Cardinal Miguel Ángel Ayuso Guixot, who died in late 2024. An Indian from the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Koovakad was previously responsible for the organization of papal trips. In its message, the interreligious dicastery noted similarities between the Muslim observance of Ramadan and the Catholic observance of Lent. 'By abstaining from food and drink, Muslims learn to control their desires and turn to what is essential. This time of spiritual discipline is an invitation to cultivate piety, the virtue that brings one closer to God and opens the heart to others,' it said. 'In the Christian tradition, the holy season of Lent invites us to follow a similar path: Through fasting, prayer, and almsgiving we seek to purify our hearts and refocus on the One who guides and directs our lives,' it went on. 'These spiritual practices, though expressed differently, remind us that faith is not merely about outward expressions but a path of inner conversion.' The dicastery said it wanted to reflect on how Christians and Muslims can become 'genuine brothers and sisters, bearing common witness to God’s friendship with all humanity.' 'Our trust in God,' Koovakad’s message underlined, 'is a treasure that unites us, far beyond our differences. It reminds us that we are all spiritual, incarnate, beloved creatures, called to live in dignity and mutual respect.' 'What is more, we desire to become guardians of this sacred dignity by rejecting all forms of violence, discrimination, and exclusion,' the dicastery continued. 'This year, as our two spiritual traditions converge in celebrating Ramadan and Lent, we have a unique opportunity to show the world that faith transforms people and societies and that it is a force for unity and reconciliation.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyDQiPXg-0Q6P	2025-03-07T17:26:08-08:00	
More Guns, Less Butter: Starmer’s Defense Spending Splash – OpEd	The urge to throw more money at defence budgets across a number of countries has become infectious. It was bound to happen with Donald Trump’s return to the White House, given his previous insistence that US allies do more to fatten their own armies rather than rely on the largesse of Washington’s power. Spend, spend, spend is the theme, and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has shown himself willing to join this wasteful indulgence. On February 25, just prior to his visit to Washington, Starmer announced that spending on defence would reach 2.5% of GDP from April 2027. In the next parliament, it would rise to 3%. 'In recent years,' states a UK government press release, 'the world has been reshaped by global instability, including Russian aggression in Ukraine, increasing threats from malign actors, rapid technological change, and the accelerating impacts of climate change.' Almost predictably, the term 'Cold War' makes its retro appearance, with the spending increase the largest since that conflict of wilful misunderstandings and calculated paranoia. Russia figures prominently, as do 'malign actors' who have burdened 'the working people of Britain' with 'increased energy bills, or threats to British interests and values.' The governing Labour Party has also gone a bit gung-ho with the military-industrial establishment. In an open letter reported by the Financial Times, over 100 Labour MPs and peers thought it wise that ethical rules restricting investment by banks and investment firms in defence companies be relaxed. Financial institutions, the letter argues, should 'rethink ESG [environmental, social and governance] mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment'. It was also important to address the issue of those 'unnecessary barriers' defence firms face when 'doing business in the UK'. Among such barriers are those irritating matters such as money laundering checks banks are obliged to conduct when considering the finance needs of defence and security firms, along with seeking assurances that they are not financing weapons banned under international law. That these uncontroversial rules are now being seen as needless barriers to an industry that persists in shirking accountability is a sign of creeping moral flabbiness. Across Europe, the defence and arms lobbyists, those great exploiters of fictional insecurity, are feeling more confident than they have in years. They can rely on such figures as European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who stated on March 4 that, 'We are in an era of rearmament. And Europe is ready to massively boost its defence spending.' To pursue such rearmament, Starmer has decided to take the axe to the aid budget, reducing it from its current level of 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027. It was, as the press release goes on to mention, a 'difficult choice' and part of 'the evolving nature of the threat and the strategic shift required to meet it'. The Conservatives approved the measure, and the populist Reform UK would have little reason to object, seeing it had been its policy suggestion at the last election. It was a decision that sufficiently troubled the international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, to quit the cabinet. In a letter to the prime minister, Dodds remarked that, while Starmer wished 'to continue support for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine; for vaccination; for climate; and for rules-based systems', doing so would 'be impossible … given the depth of the cut'. Making the Office of Overseas Development Assistance absorb such a reduction would also see Britain 'pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations – at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence.' It would be isolated from various multilateral bodies, see 'a withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank'. Influence would also be lost at such international fora as the G7 and G20. Defence establishment figures have also regarded the decision to reduce aid with some consternation. General Lord Richards, former Chief of Defence Staff, saw the sense of an increase in military spending but not at the expense of the aid budget. 'The notion that we must weaken one to strengthen the other is not just misleading but dangerous,' opined Richards in The Telegraph. 'A lack of investment and development will only fuel greater instability, increase security threats and place a heavier burden on our Armed Forces.' The aid budgets of wealthy states should never be seen as benevolent projects. Behind the charitable endeavour is a calculation that speaks more to power (euphemised as 'soft') than kindness. Aid keeps the natives of other countries clothed, fed and sufficiently sustained not to want to stray to other contenders. The sentiment was expressed all too clearly by a disappointed Dodds: a smaller UK aid budget would embolden an already daring Russia to fill the vacuum. How fascinating, then, that a daring Russia, its threatening posture inflated and exaggerated, is one of the primary reasons prompting an increase in Britain’s defence spending in the first place.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyPGulsZuxtn_	2025-03-07T17:24:41-08:00	
Trump’s Leverage Over Ukraine Grows As Zelenskyy Softens His Stan...	Volodymyr Zelenskyy's latest letter to Donald Trump marks a turning point in Ukraine's war diplomacy. By expressing readiness for peace negotiations, the Ukrainian president has shifted his tone, a move that may inadvertently embolden Trump to further pressure U.S. allies. Trump's narrative of portraying Zelenskyy as an ungrateful recipient of American aid has set the stage for a new dynamic - one where the Ukrainian leader now finds himself maneuvering carefully to secure continued U.S. support. The abrupt shift in Zelenskyy's approach comes in the wake of his contentious meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Trump's repeated assertion that Ukraine is prolonging the war for its own interests, coupled with his claim of receiving 'strong signals' from Moscow about its willingness to negotiate, has placed Zelenskyy in a difficult position. By adopting a more conciliatory stance, the Ukrainian president seeks to ensure that Washington remains engaged, even as Trump recalibrates America's role in the conflict. While Trump celebrates this as a victory for his deal-making persona, the broader consequences for European allies are far more complex. The minerals deal that was initially stalled due to Zelenskyy's premature departure from Washington is now reportedly back on the table. This agreement, allowing American investment in Ukraine's rare earth minerals, is being framed by the Trump administration as a security guarantee - one that would supposedly deter Russia from further aggression. Yet, the deal raises deeper concerns for European nations, particularly those that have shouldered much of the economic and strategic burden of supporting Ukraine. Washington's direct stake in Ukraine's mineral wealth threatens to sideline European interests, reinforcing the view that Trump's approach is transactional rather than rooted in long-term security commitments. Putin's response to Zelenskyy's softened tone is predictable. For Moscow, this represents an opportunity to dictate terms in any ceasefire agreement. The truce proposal, which includes a halt to missile and drone attacks and a pause on targeting energy infrastructure, places the burden on Russia to reciprocate. However, the Kremlin is unlikely to accept such conditions without extracting major concessions. From Putin's perspective, the mere fact that Zelenskyy is now engaging in a language of de-escalation signals Ukraine's vulnerability. This provides Moscow with leverage to demand recognition of territorial gains and a weakening of Ukraine's ties with Western military alliances. Russia's outright rejection of European peacekeeping forces further underscores its broader objective: ensuring that any post-war settlement keeps Ukraine within its sphere of influence. European leaders, from Keir Starmer to Emmanuel Macron, have expressed willingness to deploy peacekeepers as part of a broader stabilization effort. Yet, Moscow's resistance - coupled with Trump's apparent alignment with Russian demands - casts doubt on the feasibility of such an initiative. If past trends hold, Trump's administration is unlikely to push back against Kremlin opposition, raising questions about the future of European involvement in Ukraine's security architecture. Zelenskyy's attempt to reassure Washington about his gratitude for American assistance further highlights the precarious nature of Ukraine's position. His social media post, saturated with acknowledgments of past U.S. support, reflects a strategic effort to mend ties with Trump's administration. But the underlying reality remains unchanged: Trump's willingness to pause military aid and prioritize economic arrangements like the minerals deal demonstrates a shift away from the unwavering military backing that Ukraine once enjoyed under previous U.S. administrations. The uncertainty surrounding these developments leaves Europe in a difficult position. If the U.S. continues to prioritize its own strategic and economic interests over a unified Western approach, European nations may find themselves shouldering an even greater burden. At the same time, Russia's patience remains a key factor. Moscow can afford to wait, observing whether European resolve weakens under pressure or if fractures within the Western alliance widen further. For now, the contours of a potential ceasefire remain vague. Zelenskyy's outreach to Trump reflects a tactical shift, but it also signals a deeper geopolitical recalibration—one where Ukraine's fate is increasingly shaped by forces beyond its control. The coming months will reveal whether Trump's approach to the war cements a new balance of power or merely sets the stage for a more perilous phase of geopolitical maneuvering.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl4kRYL6TkpJg	2025-03-07T09:48:15-08:00	
Implementing Phase Two – OpEd	Will the Gaza ceasefire deal survive its first phase? That was the unanswerable question hanging over the formal end of phase one on March 2 and the scheduled start of phase two. Some commentators believe that Israel simply wants to extend phase one for the time being. They point out that, under the terms of the agreement, Israel was supposed to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi Corridor – the strip of land on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt – on the last day of the first phase and complete their evacuation within eight days. But on February 27 an Israeli official told the media that to prevent weapons smuggling, the IDF will be remaining in position. That decision may have been in reaction to an announcement by Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem on February 18. He suddenly declared that Hamas was interested in speeding up the hostage release process – but in return for a major concession. Hamas, he said, had submitted a new proposal to the mediators offering to release all the remaining hostages in phase two. The quid pro quo, said Qassem, would be for Israel to agree to an immediate permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Corridor. This 'offer' would place Hamas in a much stronger position to secure its long-term intention of remaining the ruling power in Gaza. On February 19, Rami Igra, former head of the Mossad’s Prisoners and Missing Persons Division, warned in a radio interview that Hamas is seeking to establish a Hezbollah-style rule in Gaza. Using the PA as a front, Hamas aims to retain effective control; to be, in effect, 'the power behind the throne. By infiltrating the government in Lebanon, Hezbollah was able to build itself into a formidable power bloc, rivaling the state itself and its institutions. 'They want to continue ruling Gaza,' said Igra. 'They will do everything to make that happen.' Israel is unlikely to be wooed into a premature withdrawal from Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said repeatedly that the IDF will not evacuate the Strip completely until it is clear that Hamas’s military and political capabilities have been so degraded that it can no longer rearm or govern Gaza. The mediators – the US, Egypt, and Qatar – will soon have to grapple with the problem of how Gaza is to be governed when the war ends – and get both sides to agree about it.There is no support from the Arab world for Hamas to stay in control. Some Arab states wish to see neither Hamas nor the PA controlling a post-war Gaza; some Arab commentators have favored a role for a perhaps reformed PA. Trump’s proposal for the US to take over the Gaza Strip and evacuate the population generated instant rejection from the Arab world. In reaction, some Arab nations initiated substantive discussions aimed at developing a comprehensive plan for Gaza’s future governance and reconstruction, but based on upholding the rights of the Gazan population. Some speculate that it was Trump’s intention from the start to goad the Arab world into considering Gaza’s future and how to achieve it. It is significant that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio seems far from wedded to Trump’s vision of Gaza’s future. On February 13, he said on an American radio show 'If the Arab countries have a better plan, then that’s great.' On February 20, Saudi Arabia hosted a summit in Riyadh, bringing together leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Its primary purpose was to consider Egypt’s counter-proposal to Trump’s suggested solution. After intensive diplomatic activity, Egypt presented a comprehensive three-phase reconstruction plan for Gaza, and has apparently garnered support from European nations, including France and Germany, as well as regional Arab countries. It favors the creation of 'secure areas' within Gaza to house displaced residents temporarily as essential infrastructure is rebuilt. A significant aspect of the proposal is the establishment of a new Palestinian administration in Gaza, distinct from both Hamas and the current PA, to oversee the reconstruction efforts. A police force composed of former PA officers would be established. Egypt’s plan maintains that Hamas has agreed to a governance structure that excludes its participation. Financial backing for the reconstruction, estimated at $53 billion, is expected to come from the oil-rich Gulf states. Some, but not all, of the proposals in Egypt’s plan received instant endorsement from the conference participants. The leaders reached a consensus on the necessity of sidelining Hamas, but some apparently favored reinstating the authority of the PA in Gaza during the reconstruction phase. A follow-up summit, scheduled for March 4 in Cairo, is aimed at finalizing a unified Arab plan for Gaza’s reconstruction, crucially reaffirming opposition to any forced displacement of its population. Since Egypt, along with Qatar and the US, is acting as a mediator in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the Gaza ceasefire deal, the Arab 'day after' plan being constructed under Egypt’s leadership will probably be put to both sides in due course. How Israel will react is far from clear. During a joint press conference with Rubio on February 16, Netanyahu said: 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public – including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them.' Two days later, following a meeting of Israel’s Security Council, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters: 'We need a total demilitarization of Gaza and no presence of the Palestinian Authority.' So it seems clear that, as part of phase two, if it eventually comes into effect, Israel will be demanding the release of all hostages in addition to the dismantling of the Hamas military and, possibly, the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza. Only then would Israel consider withdrawing from the Philadelphi Corridor. Hamas is not likely to accept these demands. However, while keeping its true long-term aims under wraps, Hamas might go along with the Egyptian proposals, especially if they emerge as a unified Arab plan. All in all, the auguries for a successful outcome to phase two – even if negotiations get underway – are not good.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl15SL3YbcQ6R	2025-03-07T09:46:32-08:00	
India’s Indigenous Women Demand Justice – OpEd	In the remote villages of Odisha, a 14-year-old Munda girl's story echoes a pattern of injustice plaguing India's Indigenous communities. Gang-raped by non-tribal men in 2022, she remained silent for weeks, her family paralyzed by fear of police retaliation and social ostracism. Her case represents thousands of similar stories that never make headlines. 'They told us to keep quiet if we wanted to live in peace,' says her mother, requesting anonymity for safety concerns. 'The police station is a four-hour walk. Even if we reported it, who would believe us?' Despite constituting 8.6% of India's population, Indigenous women—officially recognized as Scheduled Tribes—face an epidemic of violence hidden behind a veil of institutional neglect and data gaps. While the National Crime Records Bureau tracks violence against women nationally, activists say statistics fail to capture the full extent of abuse in tribal communities. 'We estimate over 40% of Adivasi women experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime,' says Shalini Gera, a human rights lawyer working with tribal communities in Chhattisgarh. 'But the real number is likely much higher due to chronic underreporting.' Justice Denied India boasts progressive legislation on paper. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005) and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989) (PoA Act) should provide robust protection. Reality tells a different story. In the mineral-rich forests of Bastar, Sunita Markam (name changed) alleges sexual assault by security forces during a routine patrol in her village. When she attempted to file a complaint, officials questioned her character and suggested she was aiding Maoist insurgents. 'They treated me like a criminal,' Markam recalls. 'One officer asked why I was in the forest alone. Another said women like me make false accusations.' Court records from five states with significant tribal populations reveal conviction rates under the PoA Act hovering below 5%. Cases routinely drag on for years, with victims facing intimidation and procedural barriers at every turn. 'The legal system isn't designed for Indigenous women,' explains Aditi Malhotra, a Supreme Court advocate. 'Language barriers, geographic isolation, and cultural insensitivity create insurmountable obstacles. Many victims abandon cases out of exhaustion or fear.' Grassroots Response In the absence of state support, grassroots organizations have become lifelines. In Gujarat, the Adivasi Mahila Sangathan operates safe houses for survivors and provides paralegal training to community volunteers. 'When government fails, we must protect our own,' says Kamla Bhaiya, the organization's founder. 'Our women learn to document evidence, accompany survivors to hospitals and police stations, and navigate courts.' These organizations operate on minimal resources. An RTI application revealed that less than 3% of the government's Nirbhaya Fund—established after the 2012 Delhi gang rape to support women's safety initiatives—reached tribal areas between 2015-2022. Success stories exist despite these constraints. In Nagaland, the Naga Women's Union successfully advocated for Indigenous women's inclusion in peace negotiations, leading to decreased incidents of conflict-related sexual violence. 'When we have resources, we create change,' says Rosemary Dzüvichü, a senior member. 'The problem isn't our capacity—it's that our work is chronically underfunded and undervalued.' The Missing Piece of Political Representation Rama Devi, 38, was elected to her village panchayat in Jharkhand three years ago under women's reservation quotas. Yet her experience illustrates a common pattern. 'The male leaders make all decisions,' she confides. 'When officials visit, they direct questions to my husband. If I speak independently, I face hostility at home and in the community.' Statistics highlight this marginalization. Since India's independence, only four Adivasi women have served in the Lok Sabha. State legislatures show similarly dismal representation. 'Political exclusion means policies affecting Indigenous women are created without their input,' says Dr. Nandita Haksar, a human rights lawyer and author. 'From forest rights to mining approvals, decisions impacting their lives happen in rooms where they have no voice.' This exclusion has concrete consequences. When the Forest Rights Act was implemented, land titles predominantly went to male household heads despite women's traditional role in forest management. Deeper Roots of Violence Beyond immediate triggers lies structural violence embedded in India's development model. Massive displacement due to mining, dams, and industrial projects has uprooted tribal communities from ancestral lands, destabilizing traditional protections. 'When communities are displaced, women bear the heaviest burden,' explains Dr. Felix, anthropologist and author of several books on tribal issues. 'Economic precarity forces men to migrate, while militarization introduces new forms of violence.' Environmental degradation compounds these vulnerabilities. Deforestation forces women to walk longer distances for water and firewood, increasing exposure to assault. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed these fractures dramatically. A survey by the Indigenous Women's Forum of Northeast India documented a 60% increase in domestic violence cases during lockdowns, with victims unable to access help lines or shelters. 'The pandemic wasn't just a health crisis—it was a shadow pandemic of violence,' says Manipur-based activist Binalakshmi Nepram. 'Government response completely overlooked Indigenous women's specific vulnerabilities.' The Path Forward Activists and experts emphasize that addressing this crisis requires multifaceted approaches. Legal reforms must be paired with implementation mechanisms, including special courts with Indigenous representation and mobile legal clinics serving remote areas. Police sensitivity training is essential, but must be coupled with accountability measures for officers who dismiss or mishandle cases. 'Laws exist, but enforcement remains captive to prejudice,' notes former High Court Justice Chandru K. 'We need structural changes in how justice is delivered.' Funding structures must prioritize Indigenous-led organizations. International donors increasingly recognize the effectiveness of participatory grant-making, allowing communities to determine resource allocation. Political representation requires both reserved seats and support systems to help Indigenous women navigate institutional barriers. Several states are considering legislation similar to the model in Nagaland, where tribal councils must include 33% women members. Most importantly, solutions must center Indigenous women's agency and leadership. 'We don't need saviors telling us how to solve our problems,' asserts Meenakshi Munda, addressing a recent gathering of tribal rights activists in Delhi. 'We need allies who will stand beside us as we dismantle the systems oppressing us.' As one Santhal elder from West Bengal put it: 'Our struggle is not just against violence. It's for the recognition that our lives matter—that we deserve justice not as an afterthought, but as our birthright.' This article is based on interviews with over 30 Indigenous women activists, legal experts, and survivors across six states conducted between November 2024 and January 2025. Some names have been changed to protect identities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl78ond_4ajfq	2025-03-07T09:44:46-08:00	
Iranian Women’s Struggle For Freedom: A Call For Global Support –...	Last week, I met my Iranian friend, an intelligent woman who left Iran in 2022. She shared a heart-breaking story about her sister, who was summoned to court and ordered to pay a penalty for not wearing the hijab. Her sister, an educated woman who has worked tirelessly since a young age, now faces punishment simply for choosing her attire. This is just one example of the many injustices Iranian women endure under the regime’s oppressive laws. As we mark International Women’s Day 2025, a recent report published (1) by the Women’s Committee of the National Council Resistance of Iran exposes the horrifying reality that Iranian women continue to face. The report confirms that penalties for not following the hijab law have intensified. The Iranian regime is enforcing the Chastity and Hijab Law with strict measures. The regime’s crackdown is particularly targeting female students. Universities are now heavily monitored, with security stationed at entrances, surveillance cameras installed, and 'Guidance Ambassadors' deployed to enforce hijab laws. Many female students have been expelled, suspended, or relocated to remote universities for refusing to comply. Some, like Motahareh Gooneii, have even been imprisoned for protesting, while others, such as Shaqayeq Akbari, have been suspended for speaking out against the university’s policies. At Amir Kabir University alone, over 200 students were denied entry for their dress choices. Despite this repression, student activism remains strong. Women are leading strikes and boycotts, resisting the regime’s efforts to silence them. The government, fearing growing dissent, has launched a full-scale effort to suppress universities, yet the fight for freedom continues. The slogan 'Woman, Resistance, Freedom' has become the message of women and Resistance Units in Iran, as well as the Iranian diaspora protests. I had the opportunity to attend the International Women’s Day conference (IWD2025) (2) in Paris, which gathered political leaders, activists, and human rights defenders to shed light on the struggle for women’s rights and democracy. Among the notable speakers were: Sharron Davies MBE – Olympic Medalist, UK; Theresa Villiers – Former Minister, UK; Baroness O’Loan – Member, UK House of Lords; and Helen Goodman – Former UK Shadow Minister. The event showcased the vital role of women in the fight for freedom, with Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), delivering a powerful keynote address. In her speech, 'Women, Pioneers of Freedom,' she honoured the countless Iranian heroines who have faced arrest, torture, and execution for resisting the regime. Mrs. Rajavi emphasised that the fight for women’s freedom is a 44-year-long struggle against religious fascism in Iran. She pointed out that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself acknowledges this battle as a ‘civil war,’ proving the regime’s reliance on oppression and nuclear threats for its survival. However, she confidently declared that the regime’s collapse is imminent, drawing parallels to the Shah’s (former dictator in Iran) overthrow decades ago. Mrs. Rajavi further criticised the monarchical and clerical systems, both of which marginalise women and exclude them from power. She denounced the absolute authority granted to the Supreme Leader and reaffirmed that Iranian women are at the forefront of the movement to bring democracy and equality to their country. In February 2025 alone, 100 people were executed in Iran, and currently, political prisoners Behrouz Ehsani and Mehdi Hassani face imminent execution. These cases are not isolated; countless political prisoners are at risk as the regime seeks to silence opposition through fear and death. The fight of my sisters in Iran will not stop until the country is free. On behalf of Iranian women worldwide, I urge global leaders to stand with the Iranian people and particularly the suppressed women. It is time to end appeasement policies and demand that all negotiations with the Iranian regime be conditional on halting executions, repealing the hijab law, and ending gender-based oppression. In solidarity, 650 prominent women from 80 countries across five continents have signed a statement supporting Mrs. Maryam Rajavi’s call to condemn the oppressive chastity and hijab law. The statement also endorses her 10-Point Plan for a democratic transition (3) and the 12-point plan (4) for women's freedoms. It amplifies her message: 'No to compulsory hijab, no to compulsory religion, and no to compulsory government.' This movement represents a global stand for women's rights and democracy. The women of Iran are leading a revolution. It is our duty to support them in their fight for justice, equality, and freedom.

This partnership combines UKAEA’s extensive expertise in fusion research and development with Eni’s established industrial-scale capabilities in plant engineering, commissioning, and operations. UK Climate Minister, Kerry McCarthy, said: 'We are proud to be at the forefront of global innovation in clean energy fusion technologies, and this collaboration with Eni marks a significant step towards unlocking the potential of fusion energy, supporting our missions for economic growth, clean power and energy independence. The UKAEA-Eni H3AT Tritium Loop Facility will not only position the UK as a leader in the development of fusion fuel technologies but also accelerate progress towards a future of safe, sustainable, and abundant clean energy.' Professor Sir Ian Chapman, CEO of UKAEA, said: 'We are delighted to be working with Eni who have shown great commitment to fusion. We believe that fusion energy can contribute to a net zero future, including going beyond the decarbonisation of electricity. The H3AT demonstration plant will set a new benchmark as the largest and most advanced tritium fuel cycle facility in the world, paving the way for innovative offerings in fusion fuel and demonstrating the UK’s leadership in this crucial area of research and development.' Claudio Descalzi, Eni CEO said: 'Fusion energy is meant to revolutionise the global energy transition path, accelerating the decarbonisation of our economic and industrial systems, helping to spread access to energy, and reducing energy dependency ties within a more equitable transition framework. Eni is strongly committed to various areas of research and development of this complex technology, in which it has always firmly believed. Today with our UK partners we are laying the foundations for further progress towards the goal of fusion which—if we consider its enormous scope of technological innovation—is increasingly concrete and not so far off in time. To continue this virtuous development, international system-level technological partnerships like this one are indispensable'. Eni supports a socially fair energy transition with the aim of promoting efficient and progressively more sustainable access to energy resources. Eni places innovation at the centre of its strategic vision and it has transformed the businesses by investing significantly in research, development, and the implementation of technologies to progressively decarbonising its energy mix and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. UKAEA’s mission is to lead the delivery of sustainable fusion energy and maximise the scientific and economic benefit. It aims to solve the challenges of this new energy source, from design through to decommissioning with world-leading science and engineering. UKAEA enables partners to design, deliver, and operate commercial fusion power plants around the globe and fosters the creation of clusters that accelerate innovation and help drive economic growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl8_b2zlU8YvJ	2025-03-07T09:42:13-08:00

Regional cooperation in AI governance, regulatory frameworks, and multilateral partnerships will be crucial in ensuring AI's benefits are equitably distributed while mitigating risks. Conclusion AI is a double-edged sword in the Indo-Pacific. While it offers unprecedented economic, security, and governance opportunities, it also amplifies strategic rivalries, ethical dilemmas, and societal disruptions. The region's future will depend on how well governments, industries, and international institutions navigate the complexities of AI adoption, ensuring it serves humanity rather than becoming a tool for domination and division.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl4U0VkLp0ZGj	2025-03-07T09:40:42-08:00	
Robert Reich: The Biggest Ponzi Scheme In History – OpEd	I remain optimistic about the longer term, but I still awaken each morning with a sense of dread. I’m sure some of you do, too. Start with Elon Musk’s bonkers comment that Social Security is 'the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.' In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets the cash, and then gets new 'investors' to funnel their cash to the earlier investors — until there are no new recruits and the whole thing collapses. The last ones in are suckers left holding worthless bags. Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme. It’s a high-functioning, universal, and exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net — the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cutting it. Social Security is a simple 'pay as you go' program. Current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024, about 1 in 5 U.S. residents received Social Security. I used to be a trustee of the Social Security trust fund. I know what I’m talking about. As the Social Security Administration explains, 'In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every Social Security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.' The only reason that the Social Security trust fund is slowly running out of money is the trustees never anticipated that so much of the nation’s total income would be in the hands of so few people (such as Elon Musk). The simple way to fix this is to lift the cap on income subject to Social Security payroll taxes, which is now $176,100. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg fulfilled their 2025 Social Security payroll tax obligations a few minutes past midnight on January 1. Most Americans continue paying payroll taxes all year. If you want to see a real Ponzi scheme, look no further than the crypto investments Musk and Trump have hyped. Trump’s new cryptocurrency, '$Trump,' soared and then crashed, just like every other Ponzi scheme. It generated enormous profits for insiders like Trump, but a cumulative $2 billion in losses for more than 800,000 other investors. Trump claims ignorance. 'I don’t know if it benefited' me, he said. 'I don’t know much about it.' (The Trump family and its business partners earned nearly $100 million in trading fees alone on the coin.) Musk has been promoting 'dogecoin' since 2019. In the days following Trump’s announcement of the launch of Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the value of dogecoin soared over 70 percent. Since then, it’s dropped like a rock. Another classic Ponzi scheme. With Trump now in office, crypto is back to its Ponzi ways. It’s emerging from a four-year federal crackdown on crypto fraud, market manipulation, and other scams following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in 2022 — one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in recent memory. Tomorrow, Trump is even holding a 'crypto summit' at which he’ll promote the idea of a federal crypto reserve that will give crypto schemes a temporary boost by increasing demand for them. But why should American taxpayers foot the bill for a crypto reserve? The most obvious winner will be Trump, whose own crypto venture carries millions of dollars in tokens that are to be included in the reserve. Other winners will be crypto executives, many of whom donated extensively to Trump’s reelection effort. One example: Ripple, whose XRP token is one of the five that Trump said would be included in the reserve — and which donated $45 million to an industrywide PAC that sought to help elect Trump and other Republicans. Trump’s crypto efforts are ways to curry his favor by paying him off. Consider Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur whom the Securities and Exchange Commission charged with securities fraud in March 2023. After Trump was elected in 2024, Sun bought $30 million worth of Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto tokens, putting $18 million directly into Trump’s pockets. Since then, Sun has invested another $45 million in WLF. Altogether, Sun’s investments have netted Trump more than $50 million. Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission just dropped its prosecution of Sun. The SEC also dropped its case against the crypto trading platform Coinbase after the platform donated $75 million to a political action committee associated with Trump and $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. To top it off, the SEC just ruled that 'memecoins' aren’t securities, meaning that Trump’s novelty crypto tokens won’t be subject to any regulatory oversight. An open invitation to more Trump Ponzi schemes. My real dread has to do with the much bigger Ponzi scheme that Trump and Musk are peddling. They’re promising huge 'savings' from destroying the federal government — including programs like Social Security and Medicaid — savings that will go to America’s wealthy and big corporations in the form of tax cuts. At Musk’s urging, the Social Security Administration recently announced it will consolidate the current 10 regional offices it maintains into four and cut at least 7,000 jobs from an agency already at a 50-year staffing low. The Republican budget recently pushed through the House cuts over $880 billion out of Medicaid. Who will get left holding the bag? Most Americans. Zoom out and you’ll see the biggest Ponzi scheme of them all — the entire Trump 2 regime. Trump is promising to 'make America great again' by raising tariffs, deporting more than 11 million people, taking a wrecking ball to the federal government, pulverizing democracy, and joining Putin and other global dictators. Trump is the con artist behind this giant Ponzi scheme. He lured voters into this fake MAGA project, pocketed some of the cash and rewarded his billionaire backers and friends (including Musk) with more, and will leave most Americans with a corrupt and decimated society. I’m still optimistic about our power to overcome this and our resilience in bouncing back from it. But the dread I feel when I open my eyes in the morning concerns the sheer magnitude of the largest and most cynical Ponzi scheme in history.

Giving New Lease Of Life To 160-Year-Old School For Girl-Students...	Long before the western world had realised the power of education to transform society, in the Princely State of Udaipur-Mewar in Rajasthan was established the first-ever school for girl-students in 1864 near The City Palace of Udaipur. It was during the reign of Maharana Shambhu Singh that the school, exclusively for girl students, opened its doors. On International Women's Day, it is appropriate to laud this singular achievement as the school - the H.H. The Maharana Girls High School - was located quite in the heart of the city of Udaipur ensuring enrolment of the maximum number of girl-students. Said Dr Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar of Udaipur, trustee of the Maharana of Mewar Charitable Foundation (MMCF), 'What transpired in 1864 with the setting up of the H.H. The Maharana Girls High School is nothing short of being revolutionary by any yardstick. Not only did my illustrious forefather, Maharana Shambhu Singh, establish the school for girls, he ensured its continuity. It should also be remembered that the Maharana was not formally educated himself, yet he gave paramount importance to formal education, and promoting opportunities for girl students to benefit from education. I must add that over these 160 years, education and promotion, establishment of educational institutions have been a continuing priority for the Maharanas of Mewar.' Through the 1880’s to 1940’s, every generation of the Maharanas contributed to the growth of education: high schools, universities and institutes were set up during the reigns of Maharana Fateh Singh and Maharana Bhupal Singh. A major contribution was made by Maharana Fateh Singhji towards the establishment of the Banaras Hindu University. Similarly grants to Mayo College, Ajmer and other prestigious centres of education were routinely made. Even though the H.H. The Maharana Girls High School, now known as the Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School (GGSSS), was being administered by the District Education Officer (Secondary), Udaipur under the Directorate of Education of the Rajasthan government, the MMCF continued its commitment towards the maintenance of the school. In 2014, it was reported that the main building of the school needed major repairs and restoration. When the school authorities approached Arvind Singh Mewar of Udaipur, chairman and managing trustee of MMCF to repair and restore the main building, the Board of Trustees of MMCF pulled out all stops to support the project. The GGSSS, though it had gained prominence in the region over the years, had made insufficient investment made towards repairs and maintenance of the school infrastructure. Consequently, the GGSSS building was in a dilapidated state. Moreover, the District Education Officer, the authority responsible for the school expressed her inability to get any funds released from the Government for the GGSSS. For MMCF, the historic relationship between the GGSSS and the House of Mewar was sacrosanct. 'We also had vast experience to undertake restoration projects in such buildings, with the in-house availability of numerous consultants, a large pool of master craftsmen and traditional skilled workmen,' said Dr. Mayank Gupta, CEO of the Foundation. MMCF was fully committed towards the restoration of GGSSS, without charging any fee for any work undertaken. It was expected that an acknowledgment for its contribution in executing this project be placed on record and displayed on the premises. Restoration begins Before and after photographs of the interiors and exteriors following major repair work at the Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School, Udaipur. Photo credit: Media Office, The City Palace, Udaipur On 17 July 2014, the restoration project commenced with Ms Nivritti Kumari Mewar of Udaipur doing the honours of putting the first paste of lime on the wall. It was planned that the eastern and western façade of the school building would be restored in Phase 1. When it was time for the 150th anniversary celebrations on 28 January 2015, the GGSSS school had been given a new lease of life. MMCF spent ₹33 lakhs on the project through its internal funding. The restoration story did not end with 2015, says Dr Mayank Gupta. 'MMCF undertook the second phase of restoration and renovation which included a big hall, four classrooms and two laboratories on the first floor of the school building. The project cost was ₹30 lakh and we titled the project as ‘Education in Udaipur’ initiated by MMCF.' In the third phase, extensive repairs and renovation of ground floor consisting of six classrooms, toilets of the school building and entrance ramps was completed by July 2016. The ongoing restoration process is being carried out by experienced conservation professionals and traditional craftsmen. During the 150th anniversary celebrations of the GGSSS, the omnibus publication ‘Haqiqat Bahida’ an eye glass view of Maharana Shambhu Singh’s life was launched. The Maharana had been the 71st Custodian of The House of Mewar (period of reign: 1861 – 1874 AD), and the Haqiqat Bahida is the daily journal of The City Palace. Ms. Nivritti Kumari Mewar of Udaipur launched the publication at the school premises, acknowledging the work done by MMCF officials, Mr. Bhupendra Singh Auwa, and researchers-writers of the Maharana Mewar Historical Publications Trust and the Maharana Mewar Research Institute. The Haqiqat Bahidas go a long way in shattering the myth propagated by the British rulers that the Princely Courts did not have systems for documentation nor were records catalogued. At the Maharana Mewar Research Institute hand-written detailed Court records of the last five hundred years are available. The digitization and catalogue work has been in progress, said Dr Gupta, pointing out that researchers from India, UK and the US have been utilizing the records.

Photo credit: Media Office, The City Palace, Udaipur Government awards The Government of Rajasthan has been appreciative of the efforts of the MMCF to voluntarily restore and develop the heritage school. In fact in 2015, the prestigious 21st Bhamashah State Level Award was bestowed to the MMCF by the Department of Education, Government of Rajasthan for the development of Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School. This award is given out to individuals, corporate and organisations who have spent more than ₹10 lakh in a financial year for the betterment and development of Government Schools in Rajasthan. In 2017, at the 23rd Bhamashah Samman, MMCF was once again honoured by the-then chief minister Ms Vasundhara Raje and state officials. In June 2023 further demonstrating its commitment to the school’s betterment, MMCF undertook a painting project infusing the school premises with a vibrant new look. This comprehensive renovation has transformed the school, creating a modern and inspiring learning environment. The renovation work at GGSSS is a beacon of MMCF’s dedication to preserving the school’s heritage with the objective of providing better educational amenities for the girl-students, said Dr Gupta. Presently 500 girls are studying in the school. On 2 November 2023, Dr. Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar sponsored the complete tuition fees for all the girls at GGSSS for the academic year 2023-2024. 'We must make concerted efforts to strengthen girls’ education and ensure universal access. Many girls yearn to learn, yet domestic or financial constraints force them to abandon their studies. I see my contribution as simply upholding the time-honored Mewar tradition of promoting knowledge,' he said, with the humility that comes with compassion and conviction in one’s legacies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvly0zIz6vxNFk	2025-03-07T09:38:13-08:00	
NATO Deputy Secretary General Highlights French Support And Discu...	NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska visited Paris today (7 March 2025), meeting French senior officials to discuss the current security situation, and Alliance priorities. In Paris, Ms Shekerinska praised France’s pivotal role amid today’s volatile global agenda. She commended France for its significant contributions in support of Ukraine, stressing that battlefield needs remain urgent and that a lasting peace requires unified efforts from Europe, the United States, and Ukraine. 'We cannot have a Minsk 3.0,' she remarked, thanking France for its proactive leadership and engagement with Allied nations. She emphasised unity as NATO’s core strength. Deputy Secretary General Shekerinska also expressed gratitude for France’s substantial contributions to NATO’s deterrence and defence, including its deployments to NATO Forces in Romania and Estonia. She welcomed President Macron’s openness to raising defence spending to 3.5% of GDP, encouraging all Allies to invest more. On NATO-EU cooperation, she underscored the need for complementary and interoperable defence efforts. Ms Shekerinska’s meeting in Paris was preceded by a visit with NATO Permanent Representatives to Istres Air Base in southern France, which included briefings on French nuclear deterrence and its strategic role within the Alliance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvlyPbNtJYvzz5	2025-03-07T09:37:01-08:00	
China: Communism Means Zero Freedom Of Expression – OpEd	While the world watches the race of competition between the USA and China in imposing tariffs on products from other countries, even more, perhaps more substantial differences than those in the management of the economic policy of the two countries are coming to light. These differences have to do with freedom of speech and respect for human rights. In the West (which until recently, no matter how difficult it is to admit, was dominated by woke culture), we have such freedom of speech that allows us to openly disagree either through statements in the media or through the freedom of assembly with the ills of the government and society. To the perception of some that the capitalist states of Europe, which follow developments in America with a twenty-year delay, are restricting freedom of speech, the latest developments of blatant human rights violations by the communist state of China provide the best response. The Chinese government imposed systematic repression of human rights across the country in 2024, Human Rights Watch stated in the Global Report 2025 in early March. The repression of fundamental human rights was particularly severe in the Tibetan regions and in Xinjiang among the Uyghurs. Human Rights Watch examined human rights practices in more than 100 countries in a 546-page global report, in its 35th edition. In much of the world, Executive Director Tirana Hassan writes in her introductory essay, 'the government of China repressed and unlawfully detained and imprisoned political opponents, activists, and journalists. Armed groups and government forces unlawfully killed civilians, displaced many from their homes, and obstructed access to humanitarian aid.' 'From freedom of expression to religious freedoms, the Chinese government maintains a suffocating control over the country throughout 2024,' said Maya Wang, Deputy Director of China at Human Rights Watch. She added that 'the Chinese government has imposed even stricter abusive laws and has imprisoned critics and rights defenders, while making it increasingly difficult to report government abuses across the country.' What are the living conditions under Xi Jinping's regime? The truth is that there is no independent civil society, nor freedom of expression, assembly, unionization, or religion, and human rights defenders and other perceived government critics are persecuted. The government considers culturally and ethnically distinct Tibetans and Uyghurs as threats and subjects them to particularly severe repression. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs remain imprisoned as part of the government's crimes against humanity in the region. It has also terminated long-protected individual freedoms in Hong Kong. Beyond the Uyghurs, of course, religious minorities are also in the crosshairs of the Communist Party. The Chinese government allows people to practice only five officially recognized religions in approved venues and maintains control over personnel appointments, publications, finances, and applications for theological schools. The concept of minority protection is an unknown notion in China. The police systematically arrest, detain, and harass leaders and members of various 'illegal' religious groups, including those Catholic and Protestant communities (or 'house churches') that refuse to join the official churches, and disrupt their peaceful activities. Throughout 2024, these individuals were charged and convicted of fabricated crimes. In July, Zhang Qingli, leader of a house church called the Ren'ai Reformed Church, was sentenced to five years in prison for 'inciting subversion' and 'fraud.' The government continues to classify certain religious groups, particularly Falun Gong, as 'evil cults' and subjects their members to harassment, arbitrary detention, and torture. In October, the Vatican renewed the 2018 China-Vatican agreement for the third time, which gives Chinese authorities the power to appoint Catholic bishops, while they continue to persecute Catholic house churches and their leaders, particularly Bishop Cui Tai. The novel 1984 by George Orwell unfortunately aligns in many ways with the curtailment of freedom of speech by the administration of Xi Jinping. The Chinese government controls all major information channels, such as television, radio, and print publications. The 'Great Firewall' blocks people in China from accessing information that is usually available on the internet. It also imposes ideological control on the educational system. While most people in China usually self-censor, certain stories—those that do not challenge the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party—occasionally reach the wider public. An investigative report by a Chinese media outlet on cooking oil contamination in July and the post by Chinese lawyer Yi Se-gua in August revealing an illegal human organ trade drew widespread public attention. Official censorship and penalties quickly followed. There have been many instances of censorship throughout the year. In January, the Shanghai police arrested director Chen Pinlin ('Plato') for a documentary about the 2022 White Paper protests. The authorities continued to update the country's censorship and surveillance regime to increase control. In February, the Official Secrets Act was revised, and the implementation regulations were published in July, extending the already overly broad scope of the law. In July, the government proposed a new national digital identity system. The cards, which are ostensibly optional, would give state agencies even more capability to monitor people online and offline. Previously tolerated topics have become forbidden. With the Chinese economy faltering, the government has banned discussions about its economic policies and punished those who criticize them. In September, a top economist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences disappeared after criticizing President Xi's economic policies in a private WeChat group. Also in September, Beijing police detained artist Zhao Zhen, who resides in the U.S. and is known for his work criticizing the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong, for 'slandering the heroes and martyrs of China' during his visit to the country. Both topics—the economic policies of China and the destructive legacy of Mao—were subjects that could be openly discussed in China until recently. The stringent information control by the Chinese government has international implications, as it has targeted exiled critics of China. Among them are intellectuals who cannot find fertile ground in China and leave for abroad where they broadcast what they have experienced. However, Chinese government officials often find them even abroad. The journalist nicknamed 'Master Li,' who collects news and videos from all over China and broadcasts them on X, revealed that he had been harassed in Italy, where he resides. The Chinese police had also interrogated his followers in China. In August 2024, investigative reports revealed how individuals connected to the Chinese government had intimidated and attacked Chinese, Hong Kong, and Tibetan protesters during Xi Jinping's visit to San Francisco earlier. The nine-year sentence of Taiwanese political activist Yang Chih-yuan for 'separatism' by the Chinese government and the suspended death sentence of naturalized Australian writer Yang Hengjun for 'espionage' have caused widespread global attention. In February 2022, it was found that the prestigious Hugo Award for science fiction had self-censored and excluded certain authors from consideration for the 2023 award before the ceremony in China. The French Enlightenment thinker Voltaire said, 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,' or 'I do not agree with a word you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say what you believe.' Certainly, the Western capitalist society we live in is not perfect, as there are significant areas for improvement in the realm of the welfare state. However, looking at examples of communist countries like China, we understand that the beginning and end of change lie in the fundamental individual political right of a person to freely criticize the wrongdoings of the regime they live under. After all, this characteristic is the most important aspect of our human existence: the right to self-negation and negation in general.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl2eAz6S70lLV	2025-03-07T09:35:18-08:00	
Blasphemy Allegations: Pakistan Must Reconsider Its Anti-Blasphem...	A Lahore sessions court recently sentenced a man to death for committing blasphemy. Last month, six individuals were sentenced to death in under a week for sharing blasphemous content online—a court in Rawalpindi issued death sentences to four persons, and an Islamabad sessions court handed out capital punishment to two individuals. Although the country has not executed anyone yet for committing blasphemy, several suspects have been killed in the past—targeted killings, police encounters, mob lynchings, and burning the accused alive. Dr. Shah Nawaz Kumbhar, accused of sharing blasphemous content on social media, was shot dead by the police in an alleged staged encounter in September last year. The week before this tragic incident, another blasphemy accused, Abdul Ali alias Lala from Quetta, was killed by a police officer in a similar fashion. In May last year, a mob attacked a 72-year-old man in Punjab after accusing him of disrespecting the Quran. The man later died in the hospital. A month after that, a mob broke into a police station in Swat, took a blasphemy suspect held there, and burned him alive along with the police station and police vehicles. The incidents might seem to be spontaneous, but the pattern and frequency of such incidents suggest the perpetrators are driven by hate and extremism that seem less spontaneous and more the result of systematic brainwashing, mixing religion with state institutions, and hate mongering—hate that refuses to die even after the murder. For instance, the radicals took Dr. Kumbhar’s dead body and tried to burn it to prevent his family from giving him a dignified funeral. The burning of the blasphemy suspect in Swat was recorded on videos with the crowd cheering as if it was a bonfire to celebrate some festival. First blasphemy accusation-related murder in Pakistan Although the year 2024 saw a number of murders related to blasphemy allegations, such incidents aren’t new in Pakistan. The first murder, or rather mob lynching, related to a blasphemy accusation in Pakistan occurred soon after its independence. In 1948, a young military officer, Major Mahmud, an Ahmadi man in Quetta, was 'literally stoned and stabbed to death, his entire gut having come out.'. He was returning from a visit to a patient and happened to pass by the place where the meeting of the Muslim Railways Employees Association was being held. Maulvis were addressing the crowd and giving speeches on the subject of khatm-e-nubuwwat (end of the prophethood). References were made to the Ahmadiyya community and their 'sin' (Ahmadis are not considered Muslims by the orthodox Muslim groups). Mahmud’s car stopped accidentally nearby and failed to restart. The mob came, and the young officer was lynched to death. Two more persons from the Ahmadiyya community were killed in 1950. After this, there was no blasphemy related death until 1992, as per the data in a report by Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS). The number of blasphemy-related cases and deaths increased during the 1990s and afterwards. Blasphemy accusations, Religious Intolerance, Nationalism The tendency to make unsubstantiated blasphemy allegations is rooted in religious intolerance which in turn has been linked with nationalism in Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, declared in his famous 11 Aug 1947 speech, 'You are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques, or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the State…we are all equal citizens of one State.' But his successors did the exact opposite. Efforts were made to block his famous speech from the mainstream media and textbooks. Religion was increasingly mixed with the state affairs and was intertwined with the Pakistani identity. India was projected as Hindu and Pakistan was projected as Muslim. Aspersions were cast on the loyalty of non-Muslims towards Pakistan. Since Pakistan was created out of India, Pakistan’s forefathers found it easy to build a national identity that was anti-India. Pakistan was created for the Muslims of the subcontinent; hence, there was the notion of making it an Islamic state despite the concerns of leaders like Husain Shaheed Suhrawardy, who didn’t want Pakistan to turn into a communal state and wanted a 'mutual relationship between the dominion of Pakistan and the sister dominion of India.'. Religious intolerance was also promoted by Pakistan's military regimes. Field Marshal Ayub Khan and General Yahya Khan 'characterized Hindus as ‘the other' and emphasized Islam as Pakistan’s raison d’etre.'. The generals didn’t hesitate in mixing religion with the institution of the army. When the 1965 war broke out with India, Syed Abul Ala Maududi, founder of the Jamaat-e-Islami Party, declared a jihad to liberate Kashmir on Radio Pakistan at the behest of President Ayub Khan. This language is used even today. For instance, General Asim Munir announced last year, 'We do not consider those as Pakistanis who do not follow Shariah and the Constitution.' A year before that, he called the Pakistan army 'the army of martyrs whose motto is imaan, taqwa aur jihad fi Sabeelillah (faith, piety, and jihad in the Path of Allah)'. During the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, the army committed atrocities against all Bengalis but Hindus were especially targeted. Big yellow 'H's' were painted on properties owned by Hindus for easier identification. General Zia-ul-Haq took the process of Islamization of the military as well as the society to another level. It was he who changed the motto of the Pakistan Army from 'ittehad, yaqeen aur tanzeem' (unity, faith, and discipline) to 'imaan, taqwa, jihad fi sabilillah' (faith, piety, holy war in the path of Allah). Intensification and Islamization of Blasphemy Laws Pakistan inherited the blasphemy laws from the British, but the country intensified and made them exclusionary in the sense that the laws provide for severe punishments when the blasphemy is committed against Islam or its holy figures. There were calls by the hardliners to declare Ahmadis non-Muslims as early as 1953 but the state rejected these demands. PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, a rather secular leader, finally fulfilled this demand through the second amendment of Pakistan’s constitution in 1974. After Zia-ul-Haq took the reins of the country in a 1977 coup, things went further downhill. He brought a number of legal changes between 1980 and 1986 that made the blasphemy laws more severe and further underlined that Ahmadis weren’t Muslims. The effects were seen in the subsequent years and are continued to be seen even today. Only 14 blasphemy-related cases were reported till 1986 after which the number shot up and from 1987 to 2017 over 1500 people were charged under blasphemy laws. As of 2021, Pakistan has seen 89 extrajudicial killings pertaining to blasphemy accusations. 79 of these killings occurred after 2000. The actual numbers are believed to be higher since not all cases are reported. Section 298-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) made the use of insulting remarks in respect of holy personages punishable by three years. Section 298-B made it unlawful for the Ahmadiyya community to refer to their call for prayer as azaan and their place of worship as masjid. Section 298-C prohibited the Ahmadiyya group from calling themselves Muslims and their faith Islam and also forbade them from preaching their faith. It also punishes them for hurting the religious feelings of the Muslims. Article 295-A of PPC provides imprisonment for up to two years, a fine, or both for outraging the religious feelings of any community whereas section 295-B provides for life imprisonment for desecrating the Holy Quran and section 295-C provides capital punishment for using derogatory remarks in respect of the Holy Prophet. The incidents of desecration of churches, temples, and bibles do happen in the country and hurt not only the sentiments of religious minorities but also hurt their lives and properties. But these incidents are not portrayed as blasphemous. The 2023 Jaranwala incident made quite the headlines, where 22 churches and 80 homes belonging to Christian families were destroyed in response to unverified allegations of blasphemy. The law is invoked when the desecration of Islamic holy entities occurs. After the mob vandalized churches and homes in Jaranwala, instead of charging the perpetrators under Section 295-A, the police registered an FIR against the accused under sections 295-B (defiling of the Quran) and 295-C (derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad) of the PPC. When blasphemy allegations are made, the argument of the accusers is that committing blasphemy in Pakistan is prohibited by law, and if someone violates the law, they must be punished accordingly. It’s a different matter altogether that the due process of law is thrown out the window and the accused is killed before they are brought before the court, as seen in the cases mentioned earlier. Blasphemy allegations have become weapons of persecution, mob lynchings, and lawlessness in Pakistan. Blasphemy laws are often used as cover for these evils. Blasphemy laws, if at all, should exist to protect the religious sentiments of the people of all faiths equally and to maintain the communal harmony in society. They should not be discriminatory against minority groups and a tool to torture them. While it’s unlikely for any political party in power to undo the blasphemy laws, a gradual approach towards the reforms must be adopted, and whenever a case of blasphemy is reported, an objective investigation and the due process of law must take place.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl5s92If7RKzr	2025-03-07T09:33:37-08:00	
Pakistan: Where Army Wields Power Sans Accountability – OpEd	He may have said it out of conviction or perhaps to please Rawalpindi. But by demanding that former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa 'must be questioned about why he resettled these [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP] militants,' Pakistan Defence Minister Khwaja Asif could well have unwittingly annoyed the top brass of the country’s all-powerful military [appropriately referred to as the 'establishment'], which is well known for fiercely protecting the dubious actions of its leadership from public scrutiny. Even at the cost of digressing, it would be in order to mention that some may argue that the arrest and ongoing court martial of former Director General [DG] of Pakistan army’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI] Lt Gen Faiz Hameed [Retired] contradicts claims regarding existence of some sort of covert arrangement within the army that provides extra-constitutional immunity to Generals. While Lt Gen Hameed’s case may give the impression that as far as Rawalpindi is concerned, no one irrespective of rank is above the law, however, this notion is far from reality. The fact of the matter is that the former DGISI’s trial is part of an elaborate plan entailing the killing of two birds with one stone conceived by Pakistan army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir with twin objectives. One, securing his own position as Pakistan’s supreme leader by politically emasculating Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf [PTI] chief Imran Khan who has dared question Rawalpindi’s extrajudicial authority and is hence a potential threat, and two, avenging the humiliation of being unceremoniously removed from the prestigious post of DG ISI by Khan in 2019 to make place for the PTI chief’s favourite Lt Gen Hameed. Returning to Defence Minister Asif’s demand for questioning Gen Bajwa, there’s no doubt that the Pakistan army is, through omission/commission [or both], solely responsible for the massive influx of TTP terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP], particularly in Swat Valley in 2022. Readers would recall that in August that year, Swat Valley saw massive public protests against burgeoning presence of TTP fighters and this issue acquired such menacing proportions that it even came up for discussion in the National Assembly with Defence Minister Asif expressing serious apprehensions regarding success of the then ongoing peace talks between the army and TTP that were cloaked in secrecy. However, Pakistan army’s media wing Inter Services Public Relations [ISPR] inexplicably played down this serious threat. It issued a statement that 'During the past few days, a misperception about the alleged presence of [a] large number of proscribed-organisation TTP’s armed members in Swat Valley has been created on social media,' it outrightly rejected the same calling it 'grossly exaggerated and misleading.' To give this big fat lie a semblance of authenticity, ISPR added that 'Presence of a small number of armed men on a few mountain tops between Swat and Dir has been observed, located far away from the population.' Since this deliberate attempt by Rawalpindi to deceive both the executive and public through an official communication occurred under Gen Bajwa’s charge, the defence minister’s view that the then army chief should be questioned is perfectly in order as well as essential from the accountability angle. However, given the embarrassing details that would emerge should this happen, there’s no possibility of Gen Munir giving a go-ahead to this request. How damaging the disclosures could be can be gauged by the source-based revelation by British-Pakistani journalist Gul Bukhari that the Pakistan army’s secret deal with TTP involved 'signing away fundamental rights of citizens in return for peace'! Furthermore, since no Pakistan army chief has ever been asked to justify his ill-considered actions that harmed the nation, why should Gen Munir set a precedent that could threaten Rawalpindi's vulnerability? Field Marshal Ayub Khan didn’t have to explain the rationale of going ahead with ‘Operation Gibraltar’, a ludicrous military plan to wrest control of J&K by inciting a local insurrection orchestrated and led by regular soldiers disguised as razakars [civilian volunteers] that pushed Pakistan into a full blown war with India in 1965. Gen Yahya Khan was never called to give reasons for approving ‘Operation Torchlight’ in 1971, a pogrom that gave the army unbridled powers to indiscriminately kill, maim, torture and violate civilians in what was then known as East Pakistan that accelerated the country’s dismemberment. Gen Pervez Musharraf was the only army chief who had to face charges of high treason, as the judiciary refused to be cowed down by Rawalpindi. But he never appeared in court, thanks to the personal intervention of the then Pakistan army chief Gen Raheel Sharif. Gen Musharraf himself revealed that 'I have been his [Gen Sharif’s] boss and I have been the army chief before him. He helped [me] out …' He went on to elaborate that 'Once he [Gen Sharif] got the government to relieve the pressure that they were exerting, the courts gave their judgment and allowed me to go abroad for treatment.' True to its tradition of keeping the army top brass beyond the reach of law, the Pakistan army ensured that its former chief indefinitely extended his treatment period abroad so that he wouldn’t have to face a trial. And when Gen Musharraf took the impulsive decision to return and participate in elections as well as fight his court cases, Rawalpindi again came to his rescue. Dawn reported a source disclosing that the then DGISI Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha had 'held a meeting with him [Musharraf] in Dubai and advised him not to return to the country as the situation is not conducive for his return.' The constitution of Pakistan stipulates that 'the Federal Government shall have control and command of the Armed Forces,' and as such the Ministry of Defence is empowered to order any serving/retired member of the armed forces to be called-in for questioning. So, when the defence minister is convinced that Gen Bajwa 'must be questioned about why he resettled these [TTP] militants,' he can always order the same. However, there’s a catch- though it technically qualifies as a democracy with an elected government, in practice Pakistan has a unique military-dominant hybrid form of governance, where the army and not legislature has the final say, and the 'Dawn Leak' incident exposes the absolute power the Pakistan army enjoys. Readers would recall that in 2017, when Dawn reported that the Pakistan army top brass had been told by the government that 'military-led intelligence agencies are not to interfere if law enforcement acts against militant groups that are banned or until now considered off-limits for civilian action,' all hell broke loose. Rawalpindi demanded that this news leak be investigated at the highest levels and action taken against those responsible and the Prime Minister's Office [PMO] dutifully complied. However, when the PMO released the inquiry report, DG ISPR, who was just a two-star General publicly scoffed the same saying, 'Notification on Dawn Leak is incomplete and not in line with recommendations by the Inquiry Board. Notification is rejected.' Now, when a two-star General can outrightly 'reject' a notification issued by the PMO, how can one expect the defence minister to have the courage to summon a four-star General [albeit retired], who had once headed the Pakistan army? And therein lies Pakistan's problem.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl4HRyY6yUCqE	2025-03-07T09:31:39-08:00	
Written And Oral Scriptures Creativity – OpEd	The Qur'an (2:183) says 'Oh you who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that you may (learn) self-restraint.' What self-restraint discipline is Hinduism, Islam and Judaism trying to teach us? What spiritual benefits can humans attain when we fast? For Hindus, Krishna says in The Bhagavad-Gita Chapter 17: 8–10: 'Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one's existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in the mode of ignorance.' For Jews, fasting should be combined with the study of Torah (the five books of Moses specifically or Jewish Scriptural texts in general). Indeed, the more one studies, the less one needs to fast. A medieval text states, 'Better to eat a little and study twice as much, for the study of Torah is superior to fasting.' Nevertheless, fasting is a very personal, experiential offering that one makes from one's own body. Study is also a personal experience, but it takes place with a text and/or a teacher and the Divine is often more readily and truly experienced in dialogue with others than in solitary meditation. But, fasting by itself does have many spiritual benefits. The sacred scriptures of the Vedas in Hinduism and the Torah in Judaism begin with centuries of extensive oral transmission of both dramatic narratives and complex priestly details. Everyone who has read the Book of Exodus in the Torah, has noted the major change that takes place after chapter 24; from dramatic narratives of escape from Egyptian oppression, and the experiencing of God's covenant revelation at Mount Sinai; to the tiny details of the Tabernacle and its priests: 'According to all that I am going to show you; use the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture, so you shall construct it.' (Exodus chapters 25: 8 to 31:11) Not only are the Tabernacle's details tiny, but all attempts to actually construct a Tabernacle according to the Torah's detailed directions, and its furniture, and its priest's garments, have failed. So why were these chapters of an unbuildable Tabernacle placed into the Torah? Perhaps because avoiding uncreative and unbuildable religious perfectionist ideals might be the lesson the Torah is teaching us. God chooses Bezalel, his assistant Oholiab, and every skilled craftsman that God has found (male or female) ( 31:1-6) Skilled craftsmen, like God, are creative. They, like the Sabbath, are the creative partners of God's covenant, and to use their creativity to reject the Sabbath is to die Jewishly. So the text suddenly turns to the Sabbath (Exodus 31:12): 'And the Lord said to Moses, 13 'Speak to the people of Israel and say, 'Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you. 14 You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you.' The Sabbath was created for people. People were not created for the Sabbath. Creativity reforms the perfectionist. As Prophet King Solomon taught: 'Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?' (Ecclesiastes 7:16) 'Everyone who profanes it (the Sabbath) shall be put to death. Whoever does any (profitable) work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. Exodus 31:15 'Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any (uncreative) work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death. 16 Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a forever covenant. 17 It is an ongoing sign between me and the people of Israel that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he paused and was (spiritually and vitally) refreshed.'' The seven day week now is a worldwide experience that shows the spiritual creativity of both Jews and non-Jews, and thus:18 he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.' For more than 3,200 years, the Jews kept the Sabbath experience, and the creative Sabbath experience has kept the Jewish People alive. Now the dramatic narrative of the experience of God's covenant at Mount Sinai continues until 35:3 when the tiny details of the Tabernacle continue into the details of the Jerusalem Temple's Priestly offerings which end with Leviticus 9:24. These Temple Priestly offerings ended with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E. which enabled the scholarly, literary, creativity of the rabbis and Torah study, to replace the thousand years of Jerusalem's Temple Priestly animal offerings, and the twelve hundred years of looking at the high priest's complex designed garments. Most of the early Oral Torah was developed by the Pharisees during the two centuries preceding the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple; and then was greatly expanded in the post Temple two centuries by the rabbis. Judaism today is very different from Torah Judaism because the rabbis found it necessary to adapt and develop Torah laws. These adaptations, called the Oral Torah, began as early as the time of the middle of the Second Temple period. The Hanukah holiday is a good example of rabbinic development. One of the most expansive and detailed areas of rabbinic law are the regulations around dietary practice, known as kashrut. The Written Torah states twice, in Exodus 23:19 and Deuteronomy 14:21, that it is forbidden to 'boil a kid in its mother's milk.' Without further elaboration, one might understand those verses to be proscribing only the cooking of a young goat in the milk of its mother. But the rabbinic Oral Torah says that these verses indicate a vast array of practices, including the complete ban on eating any kind of land animal with any kind of dairy product, the requirement of separate sets of cooking equipment and serving utensils for meat and dairy, and the obligation to wait some period of time after eating meat before eating dairy. None of these rules are obvious from the Written Torah. The Oral Law was not universally accepted by Jews neither in antiquity nor today. In ancient times, the Sadducee Priests famously rejected the authority of the oral traditions. Among modern Jews, however, religious life would be unrecognizable without some of the traditions recorded in the Oral Law, though the three denominations differ significantly in their views of it. For Orthodox Jews, the obligations recorded in the Oral Law are as binding as those recorded in the Written Torah. Liberal Jews take a very different approach. As a general rule, Reform Judaism does not accept the binding nature of Jewish law, or halacha, seeing the Oral Law as the product of human beings operating within the assumptions and beliefs of a specific historical moment rather than an extension of divine revelation. Conservative Judaism officially accepts the binding nature of the oral tradition, but offers much more flexibility within its strictures than Orthodox Jews; and claims for modern rabbis much greater authority to depart from rabbinic rulings made many centuries ago.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl7jmhE2TKDTJ	2025-03-07T09:29:57-08:00	
Pakistan’s Maritime Vision: Transforming Gwadar Into A Global Tra...	With this immense potential, the maritime sector of Pakistan can act as a catalyst for economic expansion and regional trade connectivity and can play its role in increasing the geopolitical importance of the country. Pakistan realizes that for its key role in regional or global ventures to be validated, development of its maritime infrastructure is essential — especially Gwadar Port — as it strategically sits at a global trade crossroad. However, the country is currently embarking on a strategic plan to craft and optimize port operations, build a strong foreign investment package and turn Gwadar into a world class trade hub. In order to make Pakistan a global maritime hub, the country is developing its major ports such as Karachi, Port Qasim and Gwadar on massive infrastructure development program. Presently, Pakistan’s ports are working at 50 per cent of their potential capacity, resulting into inefficiencies that are stifling further trade expansion. Pakistan’s investment in deep sea facilities, container terminals and modern logistics is aimed at bringing port capacity to maximum and improving its trade operations. To increase port efficiency, the government intends to make the port digitalized, automated, and have an improved cargo handling mechanism to house giant vessels of up to 20,000 containers. Especially, Gwadar is the focus of these modernization efforts. Given this, Gwadar is set to become a regional transshipment hub for achieving regional trade needs in Asia, Middle East and Africa, as Gwadar is an important economic driver supported by the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Free zones, warehousing facility, integrated customs management system are some of the serious infrastructure upgrades the port is undergoing to facilitate seamless trade operations. Being situated between Arabian Sea and having good access to global trade routes, Pakistan has the potential to become one of the regional trade powerhouses. And, for the government of Azerbaijan the maritime sector is identified as a key driver for economic growth and the country’s geographic advantage is to be used in order to create the trade connectivity with Central Asian Republics (CARs), Gulf States and beyond. Investment in modern transport corridors, rail networks and road infrastructure linking Gwadar with regional markets will allow Pakistan to become a gateway to trade around the world. Moreover, Pakistan’s maritime vision is aimed at growing exports from $32 billion to $60 billion by using ports to maximum capacity. The country can reduce the related logistics costs, and improve port efficiency to give local exporters a competitive advantage that will create a more favorable ease of doing business and increase participation in international trade. In order to sustain in the long term, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) in maritime sector of Pakistan is essential. The government is planning policies to make Pakistan’s port infrastructure more investor friendly with increasing global interest in Pakistan’s port infrastructure. They encourage the development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) near ports, tax incentives for shipping companies and public private partnership in logistics and maritime industries, for the purpose of economic growth. In the other hand, Fisheries sector is a significant component of Pakistan’s blue economy that is in the waiting for investment. It is expected that Pakistan’s seafood industry with a current value of $400 million can compete with regional players once sustainable fishing practices are adopted, modern seafood processing units are established and export facilitation measures are provided. Fisheries infrastructure is meant to be modernized to increase seafood exports by complying with international food safety standards. To metamorphose Gwadar in to a global trade hub of the world, extensive infrastructural development, streamlined regulations and world class logistics are required. As part of the development of its two main strategic ports at Gwadar in Baluchistan and Karachi, the government has the vision to operate the Gwadar deep sea port as a hub for bulk cargo and to minimize the use of the traditional ports for trade purposes. Gwadar’s potential is being unlocked thanks to the CPEC, as China has started pouring billions in the port after investing in the Gwadar Free Zone, new international airport and industrial parks. Due to port’s strategic depth, the port is now a regional shipping and logistics hub making shipping lines from all over the world bend over to won. Favorable legal and regulatory framework to ease business is being worked out and Gwadar is being developed as a lucrative destination for commercial activities for international traders and investors, he added. Pakistan’s maritime vision is very strong in exporting and diversifying its exports. Better port logistics and better trade facilitation have the ability to substantially increase the nontraditional exports like IT services, value added textiles and processed foods. In order to support export driven industries, the government has devised policies in such a way that efficient shipping services are available for the purpose of catering international customers. Like other SAIS countries, Pakistan also plans to leverage regional trade agreements which includes Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to augment its export expanse. Therefore, through enhancement of trade ties with the emerging economies of the world and regional cooperation, Pakistan can enhance its global trade share relatively reducing the dependency on traditional markets. Pakistan’s sustainable maritime development is part and parcel of the country’s long term strategy. Green port initiatives by the government aim at environmental sustainability, renewable energy solution, ports waste management. The incorporation of digital trade facilitation, paperless transactions along with ecofriendly port operations is a step by Pakistan towards synchronization of its maritime sector with the global standards of sustainability. A comprehensive maritime policy, which will spell out a way forward for future growth is to be announced by the government. Under this policy, regulatory reforms, infrastructure development, and international partnerships would be concentrated on for profitability on Pakistan’s maritime sector in the long run. To monitor policy implementation, special oversight committees and task forces will be created to ascertain if target goals will be reached effectively. Despite recent setbacks, Pakistan can become a major maritime nation through strategic investments, strengthened governance, and enhanced connectivity, and in turn promote economic growth and regional prosperity. Through allocating Gwadar into a blueprint as a global trade hub, Pakistan will benefit it’ economy, and help in making it a leading country in influencing the global trade development. Following Recommendations Develop advanced automation and digitalized systems to increase capacity of port handling and to reduce delay in operations. Boost competitiveness of export through simplifying customs procedures, improving logistics infrastructure and include digital trade platforms. Provide policies that are investor friendly and have tax incentives and regulatory framework aimed at attracting global investment in maritime infrastructure. Expand Pakistan’s export market by enhancing central Asia, Middle East, and Africa trade ties. Modern seafood processing should be invested in improved sustainable fishing practices should be adopted, standards of international compliance should be improved. Create maritime training institutes and skill development programs to develop high quality manpower. Promote the use of renewable energy, promote the reduction of carbon footprints and practice of sustainable waste management. Task forces are to be created on the basis of dedicated maritime policies, the progress of which will be monitored and evaluated from a sectoral standpoint. Promote maritime education, research and innovation to position Pakistan amongst the ranks of the maritime nations of the world in international shipping and trade. Developing supporting industries and infrastructure to maximize Gwadar’s strategic role in CPEC. 'The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.' — Jacques Cousteau Pakistan’s maritime vision is very ambitious but, at the same time, very achievable. The strategically transforming of Gwadar into a global trade hub is destined to unlock unprecedented economic potential, lead to regional integration and qualify Pakistan as a virtuous player in the new generation of global maritime.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl3BLrZUSNRzZ	2025-03-07T09:28:27-08:00	
The ‘India Out’ Phenomenon: A New Era In South Asian Politics – O...	South Asia is witnessing a gradual shift in its geopolitical landscape which has high resistance level against India's influence in South Asian countries. The 'India Out' movement taking shape in Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan is a collective voice rising against India’s aggressive interventions. Previously seen as a regional guardian, India is today on the receiving end of allegations of political manipulation, economic coercion and even harnessing its intelligence agencies for installing India friendly leadership in its neighboring states. It is also part of larger movement of smaller South Asian nations asserting their sovereignty vis a vis India's march to be a superpower. For decades, India has presented itself as an emerging power for balancing South Asia, largely preoccupied with the rationale of intervention for the sake of regional security. Yet the tone of its maneuvers has of late increasingly begun to be seen as double edged. As China makes deep inroads into South Asia through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), India has carried out counter measures against the rising Chinese influence using a combination of diplomatic, economic pressures and intelligence operations. Publically, India wishes to have amicable relations with China, and its behavior is competitive in reality. Neighboring nations have reason to suspect India in its 'double game' of diplomacy and strategic containment. Growing discontent with Indian interference, meanwhile, has prompted the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, which have always traded and secured on India’s goodwill, to rethink their relations with New Delhi. Another aspect of the 'Rodina nadvliga' movement is in revealing the Indian attempts to tamper with affairs of domestic politics in India's neighboring states in secrecy. India’s regional ambitions have been questioned from backing pro-India leaders to suppressing nationalist movements. Sheikh Hasina Sheikh Hasina’s fall has long been considered an ally of New Delhi; it showed how far India was involved in keeping the regime that suited its interests. India's dominance in trade and security is helped by an oppressive government that its political opposition in Bangladesh have accused it of backing. Similarly, Nepal’s democratic movements are in conflict with Indian interference. Nepal’s sovereignty has been undermined by India’s intelligence agencies that have been alleged to be meddling in electoral outcomes in an attempt to install pro-India governments. Traditionally a close ally of India, Bhutan too is seeing increasing frustration with Indian economic and political dominance that prevents its foreign relations with China and other international players. The 'India Out' movement has particularly targeted the Maldives, especially following the election of as President Mohamed Muizzu who has been vocal in his opposition to Indian military presence in Maldives. This is a major shift from the Maldives foreign policy since his administration’s expulsion of Indian military personnel, which has closer alignment to China. The move comes after the unsurprising revelation that India secretly meddled as part of its efforts to topple pro-China Muizzu, through bribery and political manipulation. Public anger was moreover fed by reports that Indian intelligence agents have been coordinating with Maldivian politicians, and anti-India sentiments spread across the archipelago. They added to tensions, however, caused by derogatory remarks about Maldivian leadership by Indian officials. Having the strategic location along the major maritime trade routes, the Maldives is the critical geopolitical player. This displacement of India’s influence in the country, as China’s reach grows increasingly stronger, is a realignment of power in the Indian Ocean region. Growing anti-India sentiments across South Asia have little to do with politics and a great deal to do with economics. Traditionally, India has held the primacy in regional trade, infrastructure projects and investment flows. But the power that its economic leverage used to give it is now seen as a tool of coercion, not cooperation. Therefore, countries like Bangladesh and Maldives are diversifying their economic partnership to reduce likelihood on India and have bigger partnership from China, Middle East and western countries. The boycott of Indian products and entertainment under the ‘India Out’ movement in Bangladesh is a political and cultural boycott as much as it is an economic one. This move is not borne out of India’s economic interests as much as it is about achieving economic sovereignty and a more equitable trade relationship. The critics say India has no longer adhered to its democratic ideals in foreign policy as it has continued to crush political opposition to its presence in neighboring countries. Critics of Indian interference, however, have been exiled, imprisoned or politically suppressed as opposition leaders, journalists and activists. The networks involved in controlling media narratives, tracking political dissidents, and blackmailing officials to hold ‘friendly’ governments seem to stem from India’s intelligence networks. Bangladeshi political activist Pinaki Bhattacharya, who has led the ‘India Out’ movement from France, also highlights the transnational nature of India’s suppression tactics. While advocacy groups like Bhattacharya continue to directly challenge India’s role in Bangladesh, local opposition parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat e Islami remain prudent and keep their distance at least as part of a tacit strategy to fend off an immediate confrontation. While the India Out phenomenon serves as an isolated expression of political dissent, it is a wider shift that is symptomatic of a broader, regional change for sovereignty and self-determination. South Asian nations repositioned to check Indian hegemony in the region. Although India still exercises considerable strategic sway, the rise of China as a counterweight gives the rest some new diplomatic and economic options.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvlzDFtH9RotFd	2025-03-07T09:25:00-08:00	
We All Loved Each Other So Much (C’eravamo Tanto Amati): European...	One of the most beautiful Italian films of the post-war period is a perfect representation of the events of the difficulties of European progressive intellectuals after Biden. In the movie 'C’eravamo tanto amati' (We All Loved Each Other So Much) directed by Ettore Scola, three friends, part of the Italian resistance movement against the Nazis and the fascists, split up after the end of the war. In the Post-Biden era, France, Germany, Italy are divided in relation to Russia. The film follows their lives and how they deal with disillusionment. Everyone takes their own very different path for each, just as it seems to happening today in Europe. The female character, on the other hand, differs. In the film a wonderful Stefania Sandrelli who goes to bed with all three friends, remains faithful in the final choice to the popular anti-Nazi principles. In the European political affair the President of the Commission, Von der Lyden who obviously does not stand up to aesthetic comparison with Stepania, betrays the popular anti-Nazi vision, continuing to take sides for a senseless war against Russia. But what must be emphasized in positive terms is the reconnaissance of the popular illusions of the characters in the film when they are together, which is completely lacking in European progressives in the face of Trump's decision to immediately end the most stupid war against Russia, because even if it was started by Russia it is clear that it was a NATO war against Russia. This brings up several questions. Question 1: Why did Biden's America support NATO to encircle the former USSR to the point of wanting to push Ukraine into Russia's backyard? Question 2. Is it really in the interest of the European left to support NATO, when it wants to balkanize Russia as it did for Yugoslavia? Question 3: On what cultural basis did European progressives decided to support NATO's aggression via Ukraine? The answers to these questions, if given with reversed progression, can explain a lot the title of this article. Given the incredible cultural, historical ties of Europe with Russia – it must be said once and for all that Russia is Europe. The violence of the cultural ostracism given to our neighbors is ridiculous from a continent whose progressive intellectuals are inspired by the empiricism and liberalism of Locke, the enlightenment of Voltaire, to the humanism of Petrarch, to the pictorial universality of Michelangelo, Altiero Spinelli, Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann, Joseph Beck, Paul-Henri Spaak would be horrified at the mere idea of considering Russia extraneous to Europe. Even Germany's Adenauer would have decisively slammed Ursula von der Leyen for her violent attitude towards our neighbors. The founding fathers of Europe always dreamed of a Europe that stretched from the Urals to the Atlantic. France can partially justify itself in the name of an enduring policy of force de frappe, which has its own logic – remembering that De Gaulle, the most lucid political visionary of the post-war period, wanted the nuclear foce de frappe, but was the first Western leader to go to Moscow in the middle of the Cold War. Ursula's fury against Russia – because it is a fury – can only be explained as a deficient cultural vision and poverty, historical diplomatic attitude. The Roman Empire collapsed due to Christian infiltration into the powerful bureaucratic-military structure, but it was pulverized by the 'barbarian' waves from the east. Does she want that to happen again? What someone should explain to the unrealistic President of the European Community is that Russia, with the Urals, is the most powerful geopolitical barrier to tribal invasions from the east. Balkanizing it as NATO seems to want is a historic mistake for a unitary Europe because it opens the way to the new Mongols capable of pulverizing the continent. But while alternative diplomatic visions are possible, the cultural violence of European progressives against Russia is an idiocy that can only be fueled by an evident poverty of cultural spirit that is not of the European left and that the President obviously ignores. How can Russia be excluded from Europe's cultural heritage? It is a blasphemy of clear Nazi totalitarian inspiration, which should have been condemned unequivocally – and did not happen - blackmailed – by the so called 'Putinism'. In the name of the Real Politck - Atlantic Pact - one can also justify a reluctant adherence to support Ukraine in Europe, but only and exclusively in a neutralist form, as was the case for Austria in its time. But it is a cultural-historical crime that does not belong to the left to boycott all cultural relations with Russia as has been vulgarly done. That is a vulgar approach, of a pure cultural Nazism style, that offends Voltaire, Diderot, beacons of the world enlightenment who dialogued with Catherine's Russia. Dragged into this absurd pro-NATO encirclement war, the European left suddenly found itself displaced by Trump's decisive anti-war Russia. In this regard, Trump must be appreciated in no uncertain terms, for having immediately made it clear without equivocation that this war had to end immediately. Perhaps Trump's decision can also be seen as a function of a break in the Russia-China axis, but defusing the nuclear war that has been touched is a decision for which all of progressive Europe should be grateful. Biden's left-wing European orphans, having not been able to maintain their cultural dignity, are now agitating in search of a leader who does not exist, and are able to detach themselves fron a EU President who has not yet understood that Russia is Europe, and not an enemy of Europe. The film 'We loved each other so much', in an anti-Nazi and anti-fascist theme that remained after the war, serves to remind progessives to not forget that Europe is free from those Nazi wounds to humanity, and which included the sacrifice of 25 million Russians, while Ukraine instead gave the green light to the Nazi army. The European left has culpably forgotten all this, so it can be said that more than an orphan of Biden, it is an orphan of itself.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvlzwEB3BCQvc6	2025-03-07T09:23:14-08:00	
The Taliban’s House Of Cards: A Regime Riven By Factionalism And ...	When the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the world watched with bated breath. Would this radical regime, after two decades of insurgency, succeed in transforming itself from a militant force to a functioning government? The answer is becoming increasingly clear: the Taliban’s fragile grip on power is unraveling, and the cracks are too deep to ignore. In his recent article, 'Taliban's Internal Power Struggle: A Regime on the Brink,' Matin Bek in The Cipher highlights a startling reality: the Taliban are in the midst of a slow-motion collapse, driven by profound internal fractures, economic mismanagement, and failed governance. Beneath the carefully cultivated image of unity, multiple factions within the Taliban are engaged in a high-stakes power struggle, each vying for control of a regime that has proven incapable of stabilizing the country. On the surface, the primary divide appears to be between the factions in Kabul and Kandahar, the two symbolic capitals of the Taliban's rule. However, this is a far too simplistic view of the situation. The true fractures go deeper and are rooted in ethnic, tribal, and ideological fault lines. The most significant divide lies within the leadership itself, where figures like Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada struggle to maintain control over a movement increasingly splintered by identity-based factionalism. Unlike his predecessor Mullah Omar, Akhundzada has neither the charisma nor the leadership capacity to unify the diverse elements of the Taliban. His reliance on the Noorzai tribe has only fueled discontent, alienating other factions and reinforcing the perception that his leadership is more fragile than it appears. Despite three years in power, the Taliban have failed to transition from an insurgency to a functioning government. Instead of providing the stability and economic growth that many Afghans had hoped for, they have monopolized the country’s resources, most notably the lucrative mining sector. Figures like Haji Bashir Noorzai, a key player in the Taliban’s economic network, have further entrenched their power, but the broader Afghan population is paying the price. Economic mismanagement is at the heart of the regime’s dysfunction. Inflation is rising, unemployment is rampant, and a once-dependent economy is now in freefall. The Taliban’s reliance on U.S. financial aid to prop up their rule has only deepened Afghanistan’s vulnerability, especially as international conversations about halting that aid gain traction. But the Taliban’s failure is not just economic. Their governance has alienated the international community, and their rejection of diplomacy and international legitimacy has left Afghanistan isolated. The Taliban’s extreme social policies—particularly their insistence on gender apartheid—have led to widespread condemnation, undermining any hope of achieving diplomatic recognition. The goodwill the Taliban once enjoyed during the Doha process has evaporated, and now their rule is largely defined by isolation. Perhaps the most telling sign of the Taliban’s instability is the rising internal discontent. Recently, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for several senior Taliban leaders, including Akhundzada. This legal challenge has provided an opportunity for rival factions within the movement to further undermine his authority. The prospect of criminal prosecution has eroded Akhundzada’s power, leading some commanders to question his leadership and fueling divisions within the Taliban. This growing disunity signals that the Taliban’s days may be numbered. To accelerate the regime’s decline, the international community must act strategically. The ICC warrant is a critical tool in delegitimizing the Taliban’s rule, and it should be used to drive deeper wedges between the factions vying for control. Diplomatic and legal pressure must be sustained, ensuring that the Taliban’s international isolation continues to grow. The United States, in particular, has an important role to play. Instead of providing direct aid to the Taliban, the U.S. should restructure its assistance to bypass the regime and deliver support directly to the Afghan people. This would weaken the Taliban’s financial grip on power and expose the true extent of their governance failures. A more nuanced approach is also needed in dealing with Afghanistan’s opposition forces. While the Taliban remain entrenched in Kabul and Kandahar, other groups—many of them tribal and ethnic-based—are gaining momentum. The U.S. and its allies should engage with these opposition groups strategically, fostering internal pressure on the Taliban. This engagement could influence elements within the Taliban to shift toward a more pragmatic governance model, a necessary step for their survival. Encouraging division within the Taliban could force elements of the movement to seek a more pragmatic governance model, one that might help to address Afghanistan's dire needs while undermining the Taliban's claim to unchallenged rule. The road ahead for Afghanistan is long and uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Taliban are teetering on the edge of collapse. By capitalizing on their internal divisions, exploiting diplomatic opportunities, and sustaining pressure on their leadership, the international community can help accelerate the process. The question is no longer whether the Taliban will fracture—it’s how soon their own internal divisions will send them into oblivion. Time is running out for the Taliban.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl2mqW57PoU7Q	2025-03-07T09:17:37-08:00	
Pakistan: Maritime Potential, Economic Growth And Regional Connec...	These days Pakistan's maritime sector remains a dormant force that presents exceptional opportunities for both economic growth and regional connectivity as well as trade expansion. Between Central Asia and the Middle East exists natural maritime trade advantages for Pakistan because its port facilities provide essential passage to worldwide shipping routes. The Pakistani government initiated a broad strategy to support port transformation and trading optimization which seeks to build Gwadar into an international trading facility. The strategic maritime initiatives will develop business possibilities and enhance regional bonds which will establish Pakistan as an influential maritime trading nation. The core element of Pakistan's maritime strategy involves modernizing its three strategic maritime ports starting with Karachi followed by Port Qasim and eventually Gwadar. Pakistan's maritime infrastructure depends heavily on these ports which were not optimally used until the recent past. Pakistan will establish its position in global shipping networks after the government achieves its objective of directing 60% of official trade through Gwadar while converting it into a worldwide trade hub. The ports will achieve world-class functional capabilities when upgraded with modern facilities for logistics management as well as enhanced deep-sea container handling capabilities. Present operations at the ports remain fifty percent lower than what their maximum capacity could support. The country's untapped maritime potential exists because of suboptimal port utilization. The government plans to optimize port operations fully which will resolve current inefficiencies. Infrastructure upgrades at the ports will enable operations of large vessels which can transport 20,000 containers although global trade expands. New developments focus on both building state-of-the-art logistics systems and digitized trade facilitation programs that improve customs procedures and cargo management. The advantageous position of Pakistan enables the nation to play a critical role in uniting trade connections between Central Asia and the Middle East and the international market. Better port infrastructure improvements in Pakistan will allow the nation to serve Central Asian landlocked nations by providing ship route access to international channels through Gwadar and Karachi. These landlocked countries will experience a major shift in their trading landscape because they now depend increasingly on Pakistani ports for worldwide commerce. The growth of trading connections will deliver economic advantages to Pakistan’s domestic market. The existing imports and exports of Pakistan total around $90 billion. Upgraded practices alongside purposeful policies will enable this number to reach double its current value in the following four years. The improvements in maritime trade performance will enable Pakistan to fulfill its expanding regional market requirements while attracting worldwide investors to boost its international market standing. The expansion of trade depends heavily on the Gwadar Port's planned development process. With its position as Pakistan’s key maritime asset Gwadar features infrastructure designed to meet global trade requirements which enable efficient loading and distribution of substantial export volumes. A transformation of Gwadar into a regional trade center will secure its regional position and promote economic expansion across surrounding regions as well as local community prosperity. The maritime sector of Pakistan aims to both modernize foundation infrastructure and enable trade activities and bring forth foreign investment to shipping logistics and fisheries businesses. Foreign direct investment initiatives have already gained support from the government because a thriving maritime economy links economic expansion to multiple sectors. The investment enables Pakistan to develop its maritime capabilities which will allow it to compete internationally. Pakistan should leverage investment opportunities in its seafood business sector. The authorities aim to enlarge seafood export values that currently stand at $400 million. Pakistan will become a prominent seafood export force in the region thanks to modernized fisheries operations and improved port logistics infrastructure which allow competition with established market participants. The sustainable development of fisheries together with marine tourism as part of the blue economy initiative supports economic diversification while creating new business opportunities for communal residents. Port optimization combined with trade facilitation improvements seeks to grow Pakistan’s exports from $32 billion to $60 billion. Getting there is ambitious but reaching this goal will trigger expanded economic growth and create Numerous employment opportunities which boost national economic stability and reduce joblessness. These changes will impact Pakistan's nation as a whole through a chain of effects that boosts its overall economic system. The government of Pakistan makes sustainability an equal priority with economic growth in its maritime strategy. Pakistan remains dedicated to implementing environmentally friendly port initiatives because climate change alongside environmental matters have intensified thus demanding reduce maritime operations' carbon emissions. The sector will maintain modern and efficient performance through digital trade facilitation that conforms to global sustainable infrastructure and smart development trends. The blue economy development represents a major component of this transition when it promotes environmentally conscious procedures in fishing industry alongside coastal tourism and sustainable ocean resource search. Pakistan will establish itself as a responsible global maritime participant only when it achieves an appropriate economic growth rate and environmental sustainability balance to protect its resources for upcoming generations. The maritime sector of Pakistan possesses substantial power to serve as a leading economic development force while enhancing regional linkages and advancing international trade. Strategic investments in port infrastructure along with global trade hub development in Gwadar while focusing on sustainable trade methods will enable Pakistan to transform its maritime sector into an economic progress engine. Future development strategies from the government confirm the essential role maritime activities will play for Pakistan's overall expansion. The enhancement of export capacity has enabled Pakistan to secure foreign investment and improve regional trade links which together establish the country for maritime greatness and economic prosperity. The upcoming period will show the emergence of a new economic period in Pakistan driven by its strengthening position in international maritime commerce networks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl03v2dZmQm4T	2025-03-07T09:14:25-08:00

Navigating Pakistan’s Future: Challenges And Opportunities – OpEd	Pakistan, a nation with rich cultural diversity, faces challenges that are as multifaceted as its people. From political instability to economic inequality, from social fragmentation to the mounting threats of climate change, Pakistan stands at a crossroads. In these trying times, the discourse of 'Pakistan First' offers a guiding light — one that prioritizes national unity and stability above all else. This approach isn't merely aspirational; it’s vital for addressing the core issues that continue to hinder the nation’s progress. Through strategic, inclusive reforms, Pakistan can unlock a future of cohesion, prosperity, and sustainability. For decades, Pakistan has been ensnared in cycles of political instability. The constant shifting between civilian and military rule has disrupted governance, with each transition bringing with it discontinuity in policy and a lack of long-term vision. This political volatility has eroded public trust, fostering a climate of disillusionment and apathy among the populace. Meanwhile, the erosion of democratic norms has only compounded the problem. Persistent conflicts between political parties and the military establishment have undermined democratic institutions, weakening the very foundations upon which the nation stands. Instead of focusing on the nation's welfare, political elites often engage in power struggles that detract from the pressing issues that ordinary Pakistanis face. The nation’s economic disparities are even starker. According to the World Bank, approximately 40.5% of Pakistan’s population lives below the lower-middle-income poverty line, and in recent years, an additional 2.6 million people have fallen into poverty. With an economy that struggles to create enough jobs for its growing youth population, Pakistan is at risk of economic alienation. Unemployment and underemployment, especially among youth, contribute to widespread discontent and frustration. In addition to these economic woes, Pakistan's rich ethnic and linguistic diversity, while a cultural asset, at times fuels social tensions. Misunderstandings between communities often spiral into conflict, further eroding the fabric of national unity. Religious intolerance, exacerbated by extremism, has intensified these divides, threatening the social cohesion necessary for a peaceful and prosperous society. But the challenges don’t end there. Pakistan is also acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Ranked 37th out of 191 countries in terms of vulnerability, Pakistan faces increased risks from natural disasters, which strain an already fragile economy. Climate-related disasters frequently divert resources away from long-term development to immediate disaster response and recovery, creating a vicious cycle that hinders progress. To overcome these challenges, Pakistan must adopt a holistic approach that centers on unity, equity, and sustainability. The 'Pakistan First' philosophy must be embedded in every level of governance, policy, and societal interaction. Here are the key areas for action: Transparent, free, and fair elections are the cornerstone of any democratic society. Pakistan must reform its electoral processes to restore public confidence in its institutions. Building robust democratic institutions that transcend partisan conflicts is critical for long-term political stability. One of the root causes of political instability in Pakistan has been the blurred lines between civilian and military governance. To preserve democratic integrity, there must be clear delineation of roles between the two. Civilian leadership must regain control of policy direction, while the military’s role should be confined to defense and national security. Pakistan’s economic policies must focus on equitable growth, targeting the marginalized communities that have been left behind. By implementing pro-poor economic policies, including poverty alleviation programs, Pakistan can ensure that the benefits of growth are shared by all citizens, reducing inequality and social unrest. Pakistan’s youth, which constitutes a significant portion of its population, remains one of the country’s greatest assets — yet it is also its most neglected. A complete overhaul of the education system is necessary, with a focus on skills development that aligns with market demands. Providing young people with quality education and job opportunities will help reduce unemployment and foster economic growth. Pakistan’s diversity is both a blessing and a challenge. To strengthen national unity, the government must invest in interfaith and interethnic dialogue platforms that foster mutual respect and understanding. By celebrating diversity, Pakistan can forge a more inclusive national identity, one that embraces all its citizens, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or language. Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change requires urgent attention. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness will mitigate the negative impacts of natural disasters. Additionally, international collaboration is essential to secure funding and expertise to adapt to climate change. Pakistan must reform its educational curriculum to instill values of tolerance, respect, and social harmony from an early age. This will lay the foundation for a more cohesive society in the future, where religious and ethnic differences are celebrated, not feared. Given Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate-related disasters, international partnerships are vital for securing the necessary resources and expertise for adaptation. By engaging with global institutions, Pakistan can access the tools required to mitigate the risks of climate change and protect its citizens. By embracing a 'Pakistan First' philosophy, the nation can begin to address the multifaceted challenges that have held it back for so long. Political stability, economic equity, social harmony, and environmental sustainability must be prioritized to create a resilient and prosperous Pakistan. This approach will not only ensure national unity but also pave the way for a brighter future — one where Pakistan stands as a model of inclusivity, progress, and global cooperation. The time for change is now, and it begins with a collective commitment to place Pakistan First.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl_3axTY5jW56	2025-03-07T09:09:50-08:00	
The Risk Of Foreign Intrusion In Presidential Elections In Cote d...	By Arthur Palix Tensions Loom Over the Ballot (FPRI) -- On October 25, 2025, voters in Cote d’Ivoire will head to the polls to elect their next president in a high-stakes election shaped by past controversies and ongoing political uncertainty. A key point of contention remains the potential candidacy of Alassane Ouattara, who has led the country since 2010 and is currently serving his third term despite the Ivorian constitution limiting the presidency to two. The Independent Electoral Commission, led by Ibrahim Coulibaly-Kuibiert, plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the vote, by compiling and revising voter lists, as well as managing elections nationwide. Recent electoral history in Cote d’Ivoire has been marred by turmoil. The 2010 presidential race, a defining moment in the nation’s political trajectory, saw Ouattara challenge incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. Despite Ouattara securing 54 percent of the vote, Gbagbo contested the results, triggering a post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 civilians dead in violent clashes between rival supporters. A military intervention led to Gbagbo’s arrest and subsequent twenty-year sentence by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. In 2015, the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), Gbagbo’s party, boycotted the vote, claiming the process was rigged, thereby facilitating Ouattara’s re-election. In 2020, the sudden death of Amadou Gon Coulibaly, the ruling party’s designated candidate, prompted Ouattara to run for a controversial third term. The election, held in a climate of heightened tensions, saw widespread disruptions, the closure of polling stations, and low voter turnout. As Cote d’Ivoire prepares for yet another electoral test, the issue of national reconciliation—long promised but never fully achieved—has become central to the political discourse. With lingering tensions from past elections and growing concerns over political stability, the 2025 vote is set to be one of the most decisive in the country’s recent history. A Fragmented Political Landscape While the 2010 election featured fourteen contenders in the first round, this year’s vote is expected to see roughly half that number—though this reduction does not necessarily signal a clearer political landscape. With less than a year to go, both declared and prospective candidates are maneuvering for a position in what is set to be a high-stakes battle. Incumbent Ouattara, in power since 2010, remains the preferred candidate of the ruling Rassemblement des Houphouëtistes pour la Démocratie et la Paix (RHDP), confirming he is ready to continue serving his country. However, opposition parties strongly oppose the prospect of his re-election, arguing that a fourth term would be unconstitutional. Among the main opposition figures is former president Gbagbo, who is running under the Parti des Peuples Africains – Côte d’Ivoire (PPA-CI). Although acquitted by the ICC and pardoned by Ouattara, Gbagbo has not been granted full amnesty for his role in the 2010 post-election violence, rendering him ineligible to run. A similar fate has befallen Charles Blé Goudé, former minister under Gbagbo and leader of the Congrès Panafricain pour la Justice et l’Égalité des Peuples (COJEP). Despite his acquittal by the ICC, Blé Goudé remains convicted in Cote d’Ivoire, preventing him from contesting the election. Another well-known name in Ivorian politics is former First Lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, who is running under the banner of the Mouvement des Générations Capables (MGC), which she founded in 2022. For its part, Pascal Affi N’Guessan, leader of the FPI, is focusing his campaign on governance, poverty reduction, and strengthening ties with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This fragmented opposition raises concerns, as the multiple left-leaning candidates from the PPA-CI, FPI, MGC, and COJEP could weaken its ability to challenge the RHDP effectively. Tensions are not limited to left-wing parties. The Parti Démocratique de Côte d’Ivoire – Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (PDCI-RDA) is grappling with internal divisions over its candidate. Former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam has been named the party’s official nominee. Jean-Louis Billon, a former Minister of Trade and influential PDCI-RDA member, has rejected this nomination and has declared his own candidacy, criticizing Thiam as out of touch. An Unstable Climate Conducive to Foreign Interference It is in this uncertain context, with the electorate still scarred by past electoral violence and a list of candidates unsettled, that the Ivorian electorate will have to choose its future president for the next five years. Meanwhile, across sub-Saharan Africa, a growing tide of pan-African sovereignty is reshaping regional alliances and challenging traditional foreign influence. The withdrawal of French forces from the 43rd Marine Infantry Battalion in Port-Bouët marks another step in the decline of France’s military presence in West Africa and comes just months after similar withdrawals from Senegal and Chad. Earlier, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali, now members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), ordered the withdrawal of French military forces involved in the fight against regional terrorism for over ten years. The Alliance of Sahel States: A Revival of Pan-African Enthusiasm Formed in 2023, the AES is a mutual defense pact promoting sovereignty, Pan-Africanism, and anti-colonial ideals. The bloc has positioned itself as an alternative to the ECOWAS, a fifteen-member organization that includes Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal, and Benin. In January 2024, the AES officially broke away from ECOWAS, deepening the divide between the two regional bodies. AES countries have positioned themselves as leaders of this generalized pan-Africanist movement, turning down not only the French presence but, more generally, the idea of foreign economic predation from which African countries have suffered for too long. In August 2024, Burkina Faso’s President Ibrahima Traoré rejected an IMF loan, stating that 'Africa does not need international financial institutions to develop.' Present in Mali since 1976, TotalEnergies recently lost its contract to a new partnership between Malian firm Coly Energy and Beninese company Benin Petrol SA. Russia: A Quest for Strategic Influence For some observers, this growing desire for distancing from Western influence in Africa is the result of vast campaigns of manipulation and disinformation orchestrated by powers such as Russia and China. While the existence and impact of these disinformation campaigns remain open to debate, they do raise the question of the extent of such interference during election periods. Two European countries were recently confronted with this type of abuse. In Georgia, the pro-Russian, Eurosceptic 'Georgian Dream' party faced accusations of vote-buying and voter intimidation during the 2024 national elections. Similarly, in Romania, Russian actors were accused of backing far-right candidate Călin Georgescu in the 2024 presidential race. A recent report by the Center for Strategic Studies in Africa highlights Russia’s growing involvement in African electoral processes, with the democratic scores of thirty-one African nations declining over the past five years. The analysis reveals that Cote d’Ivoire has already been targeted by Russian disinformation campaigns, particularly in support of Gbagbo. In a context where the PPA-CI is struggling to establish itself on the Ivorian political scene (winning two communes out of 201 and no region out of the thirty-one in the 2023 local elections), the hypothesis of a rapprochement with Russia raises questions about the influence strategies at play. The interests of the two parties seem to converge. Russia’s influence in Africa has expanded through military and economic cooperation, particularly with the AES. Through the Africa Corp (formerly Wagner Group), Russia provides military equipment, training, and security services to these nations. In January 2025, AES countries signed a Telecommunications and Remote Sensing Satellite Agreement with Russia aimed at enhancing border surveillance and disaster monitoring. For his part, Gbagbo has been a vocal critic of ECOWAS, accusing it of promoting French interests in West Africa. In an interview with AFO Media, he expressed a willingness to normalize relations with AES states should he return to power. While some analysts view this as a continuation of his long-standing rivalry with Ouattara, others see Russia’s potential backing of Gbagbo as a strategic move to increase its foothold in Cote d’Ivoire and the broader West African region. China: A Key Economic Partner China has solidified its position as a major player in the region, becoming 2023 Cote d’Ivoire’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $5.28 billion—an increase of 21 percent from the previous year. Beijing also maintains strong ties with AES nations. In June 2024, Colonel Assimi Goita, Mali’s Head of State, emphasized the benefits of the AES, which has enabled its members 'to move away from facade and ineffective partnerships towards sincere partners' such as Russia and China. A few months later, he even declared that Mali shared 'the same principles and values with the People’s Republic of China, namely respect for the sovereignty of our States, the defense of the interests of our peoples, non-interference in internal affairs, but above all the rejection of manipulation linked to human rights issues.' China’s influence extends to strategic sectors such as energy and infrastructure. In Niger, the China National Petroleum Corporation operates the Agadem oil field—the largest in Africa. Amid growing security concerns, Niger has also tasked China with protecting its energy assets. The potential return of Gbagbo to power could shift Cote d’Ivoire further away from Western alliances, particularly with France and the United States, given Paris’ backing of Ouattara during the 2010 post-election crisis. France: A Contested Historical Partner France maintains long-standing historical and economic ties with Cote d’Ivoire which it inherited from the colonial era. On the commercial front, France remains Cote d’Ivoire’s top trading partner within the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). In 2023, Cote d’Ivoire accounted for 38 percent of all French exports to WAEMU while also being the region’s leading exporter to France. However, these economic ties do not shield France from mounting criticism from Ivorian public opinion. The retrocession of the Port-Bouët military camp, perceived by some as a symbol of national sovereignty (and by others as a win-win deal between Cote d’Ivoire and France), comes at a time when anti-French rhetoric is gaining ground in French-speaking Africa. As journalist Alain Foka noted in a May 2023 analysis, younger generations born after independence are questioning the economic and military influence France continues to exert over its former colonies, seen as predatory rather than beneficial. On the other hand, analysts suggest that military cooperation between Paris and Abidjan is far from over. Political expert Seidik Aba predicts that Ouattara, while formally ending France’s direct military presence, may pursue a different model of collaboration, focusing on training programs and intelligence sharing rather than deploying troops on Ivorian soil. Billon could also be seen as a candidate whose election could stabilize relations France and Cote d’Ivoire. A prominent businessman and former Minister of Commerce, Billon ran the Société Immobilière et Financière de la Côte Africaine (SIFCA)—one of Cote d’Ivoire’s largest agro-industrial firms, founded by his father in 1964. SIFCA’s financial ties with France are significant. Over the past decade, Société Générale and Proparco (a subsidiary of the French Development Agency) have invested 85 million euros in SIFCA’s development projects. Billon’s leadership in agriculture and industry positions him as a pro-business figure with strong international connections, particularly in France, Senegal, and Nigeria. However, Billon is not yet an official candidate for his party, the PDCI-RDA, which is currently chaired by Thiam. Thiam has long-standing ties with France and international financial institutions. In a 2009 interview with the Institut Montaigne, he declared that 'France will live. France will continue to shine. My France is an idea, and ideas never die.' Graduated from the École Polytechnique the Mines de Paris, the former Crédit Suisse executive maintains close relationships with French and Anglo-American financial circles. More recently, Thiam suggested international funding for Cote d’Ivoire’s electoral commission to facilitate the updating of the electoral roll. The United States and Israel: Waning Influence or Strategic Shift? The direction of US foreign policy in Africa under the second administration of President Donald Trump remains uncertain. Alhaji Bouba Nouhou from the Michel de Montaigne University in Bordeaux suggests this could pave the way for emerging powers like Iran to deepen their involvement in AES countries, particularly in technology and defense cooperation. A long-standing ally of the United States, Israel also plays a strategic role in West Africa, with Cote d’Ivoire serving as a key partner for Tel Aviv. In October 2024, an agreement was signed for the sale of a patrol boat manufactured by Israel Shipyard. A framework agreement also links the two countries, granting Ivorian access to Israeli expertise in cybersecurity, agriculture, and water management. The foregoing notwithstanding, Israel has announced a reduction in military exports to Cote d’Ivoire, aiming to prevent its weapons from being used in potential election-related violence. A re-election of Ouattara could be favorable for Washington and Tel Aviv, reinforcing Western influence in the region against Russian, Chinese, and Iranian interests. A Decisive Ballot The prospect of foreign interference in Cote d’Ivoire’s 2025 presidential election remains a sensitive issue. As of now, there have been no confirmed efforts to manipulate or destabilize the election process, making any claims of such interference premature. While international actors may hold strategic interests in the country, reducing the election to a mere battleground for external influence risks oversimplifying Ivorian’s complex political landscape, its electoral autonomy, and the ability of candidates to run independent campaigns free from overt propaganda. A pragmatic and evidence-based approach is crucial in addressing the issue—avoiding conspiracy theories and the blanket demonization of any side. Should foreign interference emerge in Cote d’Ivoire’s elections, its true impact will only become clear once the facts and electoral dynamics unfold. That said, electoral interference is not a theoretical concern. Last year, the United States faced attempts of influence from Iran during its 2024 election, while Canada condemned Chinese interference targeting its own electoral process, serving as stark reminders that such risks are real. In this fragile context, ensuring stability and sovereignty are the watchwords for a nation striving for national reconciliation, still bearing the scars of past crises and the hopes of a brighter future. As a strategic crossroads in West Africa, Cote d’Ivoire is both a stakeholder and a player in this dynamic. The outcome of this election could redefine its relations with its international partners and influence the equilibrium of the balance of power in the region. In 2025, Cote d’Ivoire will not only appoint a new leader, but it will also make a decisive choice about the democratic path it wishes to take. Between security concerns, economic transformations, and political tensions, this election will be a defining moment—one that reveals both the progress made and the challenges that lie ahead.

What Are The Origins Of The Money We Use Today? Revisiting Heinri...	The pioneering research by one of the founders of economic anthropology is essential for understanding the social and institutional processes that gave rise to money as we know it. The late 19th century saw economists, mainly German and Austrian, create a mythology of money's origins that is still repeated in today's textbooks. Money is said to have originated as just another commodity being bartered, with metal preferred because it is nonperishable (and hence amenable to being saved), supposedly standardized (despite fraud if not minted in temples), and thought to be easily divisible—as if silver could have been used for small marketplace exchanges, which was unrealistic given the rough character of ancient scales for weights of a few grams.1 This mythology does not recognize government as having played any role as a monetary innovator, sponsor, or regulator, or as giving money its value by accepting it as a vehicle to pay taxes, buy public services, or make religious contributions. Also downplayed is money's function as a standard of value for denominating and paying debts.2 Although there is no empirical evidence for the commodity-barter origin myth, it has survived on purely hypothetical grounds because of its political bias that serves the anti-socialist Austrian school and subsequent 'free market' creditor interests opposing government money creation. Schurtz's Treatment of Money as Part of the Overall Social System As one of the founders of economic anthropology, Heinrich Schurtz approached the origins of money as being much more complex than the 'economic' view that it emerged simply as a result of families going to the marketplace to barter. Surveying a wide range of Indigenous communities, his 1898 book, An Outline of the Origins of Money, described their trade and money in the context of the institutional system within which members sought status and wealth. Schurtz described these monetary systems as involving a wide array of social functions and dimensions, which today's 'economic' theorizing excludes as external to its analytic scope. Placing money in the context of the community's overall system of social organization, Schurtz warned that anyone who detaches 'sociological and economic problems from the environment in which they emerged... their native land... only carries away a part of the whole organism and fails to understand the vital forces that have created and sustained it.' Looking at Indigenous communities as having preserved presumably archaic traditions, Schurtz viewed trade with outsiders as leading wealth to take an increasingly monetary form that eroded the balance of internal social relations. Schurtz deemed the linkage between money, debt, and land tenure to lie beyond the area on which he focused, nor did he mention contributions to group feasts (which historian Bernard Laum suggested as the germ from which Greek obols and drachmas may have evolved).3 The paradigmatic forms of Indigenous wealth were jewelry and other items of personal adornment, decorations, and trophies, especially foreign exotic products in the form of shells and gemstones or items with a long and prestigious history that gave their wearers or owners status. Thorstein Veblen would call the ownership and display of such items conspicuous consumption in his 1899 book, The Theory of the Leisure Class. They had an exchange value, as they do today, but that did not make them monetary means of exchange. Schurtz saw many gray areas in their monetization: 'Beads made of clay and stone are also crafted by Indigenous people and widely used as ornaments but rarely as money.' At issue was how a money economy differs from barter and from the circulation and exchange of useful and valued items in a social economy. Was Indigenous exchange and wealth pre-monetary, an archaic seed that led to money's 'more ideal forms?' Schurtz's Distinction Between Inside-Money and Outside-Money Exchange with outsiders was typically conducted by political leaders as the face of their communities to the outside world. Trade (and also payment of tribute) involved fiscal and social relations whose monetary functions differed from those of the domestic economy but ended up dovetailing with them to give money a hybrid character. Schurtz distinguished what he called outside-money from inside-money, with outside-money ultimately dominating the inside monetary system. 'The concept of money,' he wrote, originated 'from two distinct sources: What functions as the foundation of wealth and measure of value for property and serves social ends within a tribe is, in its origins, something entirely different from the means of exchange that travels from tribe to tribe and eventually transforms itself, as a universally welcomed commodity, into a kind of currency.' Inside-money was used within communities for their own exchange and wealth. Outside-money was derived from transactions with outsiders. And what was 'outside' was a set of practices governing trade outside the jurisdiction of local governance.4 Schurtz's distinction emphasized a characteristic of trade that has continued down through today's world: the contrast between domestic payments subject to checks and balances to protect basic needs and navigating status hierarchies but (ideally) limiting sharp wealth disparities, and exchange with outsiders, often conducted on islands, quay areas, or other venues socially outside the community's boundaries, subject to more impersonal standardized rules. Throughout the ancient world, we find offshore island entrepots wherever they are conveniently located for conducting trade with outsiders. These islands kept foreign contact at arm's length to prevent mercantile relations from disturbing the local economic balance. Egypt restricted foreign contacts to the Delta region where the Nile flowed into the Mediterranean. For the Etruscans, the island of Ischia/Pithekoussai became the base for Phoenician and Greek merchants to deal with the Italian mainland in the eighth and seventh centuries BCE. North Germans seem to have conducted the Baltic amber trade through the sacred island of Helgoland. 'The emergence of specific internal monetary systems is always supported by the inclination to transform outside-money into inside-money, and to employ money not to facilitate external trade, as one might assume according to common theories, but rather to obstruct it,' Schurtz concluded. In his chapter, 'Metal as Ornament and Money,' he pointed out that it was foreign trade that led metal to become the primary form of money. 'While most varieties of ornament-money gradually lose their significance, one of them, metal-money, asserts its ground all the more and finally pushes its competitors out of the field.' He added that: 'Metal-money made from noble metals is not a pure sign-money, it is at the same time a valuable commodity, the value of which depends on supply and demand. In its mature form, it therefore in itself embodies the fusion of inside-money with outside-money, of the sign of value and valuable property with the means of exchange.'5 This merging of inside- and outside-money is documented already in the third millennium BCE in the Near East. Silver-money was used for long-distance trade and came to be used for domestic enterprise as well, while grain remained the monetary vehicle for denominating agrarian production, taxes, and debt service on the land, and for distribution to dependent labor in Mesopotamia's temples and palaces. Schurtz also questioned whether the dominance of metallic money emerged spontaneously in many places or whether there was a diffusion from a singular origin, that is, 'whether a cultural institution has grown in situ or whether it has been transferred from other regions through migration and contact between societies.' The diffusion of Mesopotamian weights is associated with silver points to its diffusion from that region, as does the spread of the region's practice of setting interest rates simply for ease of calculation in terms of the local fractional arithmetic system (60ths in Mesopotamia for a shekel per mina a month, 10ths or percentages in decimalized Greece, and 12ths in Rome for a troy ounce per pound each year). Checks and Balances to Prevent the Selfish Concentration of Wealth What does seem to have developed spontaneously were social attitudes and policies to prevent the concentration of wealth from injuring economic balance. Wealth concentration, especially when achieved by depriving cultivators of their means of livelihood, would have violated the ethic of mutual aid that low-surplus economies need as a condition for their resilience. Viewing money as part of the overall social context, Schurtz described 'the social transformation brought about by wealth' as a result of monetizing trade and its commercial pursuit of profit, or 'acquisitiveness': '[E]veryone is now compelled to join in the competition for property or he will be pulled into the vortex created by one of the newly emerging centers of power and property, where he will need to work hard to be able to live at all. For the property owner, no temporal limit constrains his view on the perpetual increase of his wealth.' Schurtz characterized the economic mentality as a drive for 'the unlimited accumulation of movable property,' to be passed on to one's children, leading to the creation of a wealthy hereditary class. If archaic societies had this ethic, could ancient civilizations have taken off? How did they prevent the growth of wealth from fostering an oligarchy seeking to increase its wealth at the expense of the community at large and its resilience? Schurtz reviewed how Indigenous communities typically avoided that fate by shaping a social value system that would steer wealth away from being used to achieve predatory power over others. He cited numerous examples in which 'immense treasures often accumulate without reentering the transactions of daily life.' One widespread way to do this was simply to bury wealth. 'The primitive man,' he wrote, 'believes that he will have access to all the goods given to him in the grave, even in the afterlife. Thus, he too knows no bounds to acquisition.' Taking his greed and wealth with him to use in the hereafter prevents hoarded wealth from being inherited 'and growing into a dangerous instrument of power' by becoming dynastic; ultimately operating 'on the belief that the deceased does not give up his rights of ownership but jealously guards over his property to ensure that no heir makes use of it.' A less destructive removal of wealth from its owners was to create an ethic of peer pressure in which individuals gained status and popular acclaim by accumulating wealth to give away. Schurtz wrote: '[R]emnants of the ancient communism remain alive enough for a long time to effectively block attempts to amass as many assets as possible in a single hand. And in places without an actual system of debt and interest, the powerful individual, into whose house the tributes of the people flow, has indeed little choice but to 'represent' by way of his wealth: in other words, to allow the people to participate in his indulgences.' Such an individual achieves philanthropic renown by generously distributing his possessions to 'his friends and followers, winning their hearts and thereby establishing real power based on loyal devotion.' One widespread practice was to celebrate marriages, funerals, and other rites of passage by providing great feasts. This 'extraordinary... destruction and squandering of valuable property, particularly livestock and food, during those grand festivals of the dead that evolved out of sacrifices and are, among some peoples, not only an effective obstacle to the accumulation of wealth but have turned into economic calamities' when families feel obliged to take on debt to host such extravagant displays. Religious officials and temples often played a role in such rituals. Noting that 'money, trade, and religion had a good relationship with one another in antiquity,' Schurtz cited the practice of donating wealth to temples or their priesthoods. But he recognized that this might enable them to 'gain dominance through the ownership of money' under their control. 'The communist countermeasures against wealth generally do not endure,' Schurtz wrote. 'Certain kinds of property seem to favor greed directly, especially cattle farming, which can literally turn into a hoarding addiction.' He described communalistic values of mutual aid as tending to break down as economies polarized with the increase in commercial wealth. Schurtz also noted that the social checks on personal wealth-seeking did not apply to economies that developed a 'system of debt and interest.' Wealth in the form of monetary claims on debtors was not buried and could hardly be redistributed to the population at large, whose members typically were debtors to the rising creditor interest. The only way to prevent such debts from polarizing society was to cancel them. That is what Near Eastern rulers did, but Schurtz's generation had no way of knowing about their Clean Slate proclamations. Starting with the very outset of debt records c. 2500 BCE in Sumer, and continuing down through Babylonia, Assyria, to their neighbors, and on through the early first millennium BCE, rulers annulled financial claims on agrarian debtors. That prevented creditors from concentrating money and land in their own hands. One might say that these debt cancellations and land redistributions were the Near Eastern alternative to destroying material wealth to preserve balance. These royal acts did not destroy physical wealth but simply wiped out the debt overhead to maintain widespread land tenure and liberty for the population at large. Canceling agrarian debt was politically feasible because most personal debts were owed to the palace sector and its temples or their officials. Royal Clean Slates seemed so unthinkable when they began to be translated around the turn of the last century that early readers hardly could believe that they actually were enforced in practice. François Thureau-Dangin's French translation of the Sumerian ruler Enmetena's (c. 2400 BCE) proclamation in 1905 was believed by many observers to be too utopian and socially disruptive to have been followed in practice, as was the Biblical Jubilee Year of Leviticus 25.6 But so many such proclamations have been found, extending so continuously over thousands of years—along with lawsuits in which judges upheld their increasing detail—that there is no doubt that these acts did indeed reconcile the accumulation of monetary wealth with social resilience by blocking the creation of predatory oligarchies such as those that would emerge in classical Greece and Rome and indeed survive into today's world. Monetary Innovations in the Bronze Age Near Eastern Palaces and Temples Economic documentation in Schurtz's day was able to trace monetary practice only as far back as classical Greece and Rome. There was a general belief that their practices must have evolved from Indigenous Indo-European speakers. Marcel Mauss would soon treat the gift exchange of the Kwakiutl tribe of the Canadian Pacific Northwest (with their competitive one-upmanship) as the prototype for the idea of charging interest. But monetary interest has a specific stipulated rate, with payments due on specific periodic dates set by written contracts. That practice stems from Sumer in the third millennium BCE, along with silver (and grain) money and related financial innovations in the economic big bang that has shaped subsequent Western economic evolution. Money's function as a standard of valuation did not play a big role in Schurtz's survey. But subsequent archaeological research has revealed that money's emergence as part of an overall institutional framework cannot be understood without reference to written account-keeping, denominating debt accruals, and fiscal relations. Money, credit/debt, and fiscal obligations have all gone together since the origins of written records in the ancient Near East. Near Eastern fiscal and financial records describe a development of money, credit, and interest-bearing debt that neither the barter theory nor Schurtz's ethnographic studies had imagined. Mesopotamia's 'more ideal' money evolved out of the fiscal organization of account-keeping and credit in the palaces and temples of Sumer, Babylonia, and their Bronze Age neighbors (3200–1200 BCE). These Near Eastern economies were larger in scale and much more complex and multilayered than most of the Indigenous communities surveyed by Schurtz. In contrast to largely self-sufficient communities, southern Mesopotamia was obliged to engage in large-scale and long-distance trade because the region's river-deposited soil lacked metal, stone, and even hardwood. The region's need for raw materials was far different from the trade and 'monetization' of luxuries by the relatively small-scale and self-sufficient communities studied by Schurtz and hypothesized by economists imagining individuals bartering at their local market. In these communities, he noted: 'The amount of metal shaped into ornaments almost always far outweighs the amount transformed into practical tools.' Mesopotamia's trade had to go far beyond personal decorative luxuries and prestige commodities or trophy items. An entrepreneurial merchant class was needed to obtain these raw materials, along with a specialized labor force, which was employed by the temples and palaces that produced most export handicrafts, provisioned corvée labor to work on public infrastructure, served as mints and overseers of weights and measures, and mediated most monetary wealth and debt. This required forward planning and account-keeping to feed and supply labor (war widows, orphans, and slaves) in their weaving and other handicraft workshops and to consign their output to merchants for export. Calculating the cost of distributing food and raw materials within these large institutions and valuing their consignment of goods to merchants required designing standard weights and measures as the basis for this forward planning. Selecting monetary units was part of this standardization of measuring costs and value. This made possible the calculation of expected rental income or shortfalls, along with profit-and-loss statements and balance sheets. The typical commodity to be distributed was grain, which served as a standard of value for agrarian transactions and credit balances that mounted up during the crop year for advances to sharecroppers, consumption such as beer from ale-women, and payments to priests for performing ceremonial functions. Their value in grain was to be paid at harvest time. The calculation of food rations for distribution to the various grades of labor (male, female, and children) enabled the costs to be expressed in grain or in workday equivalents. Schurtz would have called this grain 'inside-money,' and regarded as 'outside-money' the silver minted by temples for dealing with foreign trade and as the basic measure of value for business transactions with the palace economy and for settling commercial obligations. A mina (60 shekels) of silver was set as equal to a corresponding unit of grain as measured on the threshing floor. That enabled accounts to be kept simultaneously in silver and grain. The result was a bi-monetary grain-silver standard reflecting the bifurcation of early Mesopotamian economies between the agrarian families on the land (using grain as 'inside-money') and the palatial economy with its workshops, foreign trade, and associated commercial enterprise (using silver as 'outside-money'). Prices for market transactions with outsiders might vary, but prices for debt payments, taxes, and other transactions with large institutions were fixed. Schurtz's conclusion that the rising dominance of commercial money tended to break down domestic checks and balances protecting the Indigenous communities that he studied is indeed what happened when commercial debt practices were brought from the Near East to the Aegean and Mediterranean lands around the eighth century BCE. Having no tradition of royal debt cancellations as had existed in the Near East ever since the formative period of interest-bearing debt, the resulting decontextualization of credit practices fostered financial oligarchies in classical Greece and Rome. After early debt cancellations and land redistribution by populist 'tyrants' in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, the ensuing classical oligarchies resisted popular revolts demanding a revival of such policies. The dynamics of interest-bearing debt and the pro-creditor debt laws of classical antiquity's creditor oligarchies caused economic polarization that led to five centuries of civil warfare. These upheavals were not the result of the coinage that began to be minted around the eighth century BCE, as many 19th-century observers believed, mistakenly thinking that Aegean coinage was the first metallic money. Silver-money had been the norm for two millennia throughout the Near East, without causing disruption like that experienced by classical antiquity. What polarized classical antiquity's economies were pro-creditor debt laws backed by political violence, not money. Conclusion and Discussion Schurtz's starting point was how communities organized the laws of motion governing their distribution of wealth and property. He viewed money as emerging from this institutional function with a basically communalistic ethic. A key characteristic of Indigenous economic resilience was social pressure expecting the wealthy to contribute to social support. That was the condition set by unwritten customs for letting some individuals and their families become rich. Schurtz and subsequent ethnologists found a universal solution for reconciling wealth-seeking with community-wide prosperity to be social pressure for wealthy families (that was the basic unit, not individuals) to distribute their wealth to the citizenry by reciprocal exchange, gift-giving, mutual aid, and other forms of redistribution, and providing large feasts, especially for rites of passage. This was a much broader view than the individualistic economic assumption that personal gain-seeking and, indeed, selfishness were the driving forces of overall prosperity. The idea of monetizing economic life under communalistic mutual aid or palace direction was and remains anathema to mainstream economists, reflecting the worldview of modern creditors and financial elites. Schurtz recognized that mercantile wealth-seeking required checks and balances to prevent economies from impoverishing their members. The problem for any successfully growing society to solve was how to prevent the undue concentration of wealth obtained by exploitative means that impaired overall welfare and the ability of community members to be self-supporting. Otherwise, economic polarization and dependency would lead members to flee from the community, or perhaps it simply would shrink and end up being defeated by outsiders who sustained themselves by more successful mutual aid. As noted above, Schurtz treated the monetization of wealth in the form of creditor claims on debtors as too post-archaic to be a characteristic of his ethnographic subjects. But what shaped the context for monetization and led 'outside-money' to take priority over inside-money were wealth accumulation by moneylending and the fiscal and military uses of money. Schurtz correctly rejected Bruno Hildebrand's characterization of money as developing in stages, from small-scale barter to monetized economies becoming more sophisticated as they evolved into financialized credit economies.7 And, in fact, the actual historical sequence was the reverse. From Mesopotamia to medieval Europe, agrarian economies operated on credit during the crop year. Monetary payment occurred at harvest time to settle the obligations that had accumulated since the last harvest and to pay taxes. This need to pay debts was a major factor requiring money's development in the first place. Barter became antiquity's final monetary 'stage' as Rome's economy collapsed after its creditor oligarchy imposed debt bondage and took control of the land. When emperors were unable to tax this oligarchy, they debased the coinage, and life throughout the empire devolved into local subsistence production and quasi-barter. Foreign trade was mainly for luxuries brought by Arabs and other Near Easterners. The optimistic sequence that Hildebrand imagined not only mistakenly adopted the barter myth of monetary origins but also failed to take debt polarization into account as economies became monetarized and financialized. Schurtz described how the aim of preventing the maldistribution of wealth was at the heart of Indigenous social structuring. But it broke down for various reasons. Economies in which family wealth took the form of cattle, he found, tended to become increasingly oppressive to maintain the polarizing inequality that developed. The same might be said of credit economies under the rising burden of interest-bearing debt. Schurtz noted the practice of charging debtors double the loan value—and any rate of interest indeed involves an implicit doubling time. That exponential dynamic is what polarizes financialized economies. In contrast to Schurtz, mainstream economists of his generation avoided dealing with the effect of monetary innovation and debt on the distribution of wealth. The tendency was to treat money as merely a 'veil' of price changes for goods and services, without analyzing how credit polarizes the economy's balance sheet of assets and debt liabilities. Yet, the distinguishing feature of credit economies was the use of moneylending as a lever to enrich creditors by impoverishing debtors. That was more than just a monetary problem. It was a political creditor/debtor problem and, ultimately, a public/private problem. The issue was whether a ruler or civic public checks would steer the rise in monetary wealth in ways that avoided the creation of creditor oligarchies. Most 19th-century and even subsequent economic writers shied away from confronting this political context, leaving the most glaring gap in modern economic analysis. It was left to the discovery of cuneiform documentation to understand how money first became institutionalized as a vehicle to pay debts. This monetization was accompanied by remarkable success in sustaining rising wealth while preventing its concentration in the hands of a hereditary oligarchy. That Near Eastern success highlights what the smaller and more anarchic Western economies failed to achieve when interest-bearing debt practices were brought to the Mediterranean lands without being checked by the tradition of regular cancellation of personal nonbusiness debt. Credit and monetary wealth were privatized in the hands of what became an increasingly self-destructive set of classical oligarchies culminating in that of Rome, which fought for centuries against popular revolts seeking protection from impoverishing economic polarization. The devastating effects of transplanting Near Eastern debt practices into the Mediterranean world's less communalistic groupings show the need to discuss the political, fiscal, and social-moral context for money and debt. Schurtz placed monetary analysis in the context of society's political institutions and moral values and explained how money is a product of this context and, indeed, how monetization tends to transform it—in a way that tends to break down social protection. His book has remained relatively unknown over the last century, largely because his institutional anthropological perspective is too broad for an economics discipline that has been narrowed by pro-creditor ideologues who have applauded the 'free market' destruction of social regulation aimed at protecting the interests of debtors. That attitude avoids recognizing the challenges that led the Indigenous communities studied by Schurtz, and also the formative Bronze Age Near East, to protect their resilience against the concentration of wealth, a phenomenon that has plagued economies ever since classical antiquity's decontextualization of Near Eastern debt practices.

The barter theory has been refuted by modern research uncovering the Bronze Age Near Eastern institutional origins of money, which I discuss in chapters 1 and 3 of Temples of Enterprise (Hudson, 2024). My criticisms of this theory are in 'Origins of Money and Interest: Palatial Credit, Not Barter' (Hudson, Michael, 2020). 2 See the papers collected in Wray, L. Randall, 2004. 3 Mauss, Marcel (1925), 2016; Laum, Bernard, 1924. Schurtz mentions spit-money in passing but finds trade in food relatively unimportant. 4 I discuss this in 'From Sacred Enclave to Temple to City' (Hudson, Michael, 1999) and Chapter 10 of Temples of Enterprise (Hudson, Michael, 2024). 5 Schurtz cited as an example of how monetary authorities could substitute sign-money for metal-money the case of 'Kublai Khan, the ruler of the Mongolian empire, [who] drove out metal-money with sign-money, specifically stamped pieces of paper, evidently following the Chinese example; Marco Polo's accounts indicate that the endeavor must have temporarily succeeded only because of the tremendous power and authority of the ruler, with the result of a vast accumulation of gold and silver in the Khan's residence.' But he made disparaging remarks about the French government's paper money assignats and called John Law a 'swindler,' dismissing government money creation. 6 Thureau-Dangin, François (1905: 86–87), translated the Sumerian term for 'justice' (amargi) to mean specifically that officials and wealthy individuals ('the powerful') would have no legal claims for debt foreclosure. 7 Hildebrand, Bruno (1864), classified economies as passing from Naturalwirtschaft ('barter economy') to Geldwirtschaft ('gold/commodity money economy') and finally Kreditwirtschaft ('credit economy').

Malaysia: Recent Video Mocking Hinduism Reflects Growing Religiou...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof A seven-second video clip on social media targeting a Hindu festival is the latest incident that reflects growing polarization in multi-faith, multi-ethnic Malaysia, analysts say. The clip, posted Tuesday on a radio station’s social media platform, showed three Malay Muslim on-air personalities mimicking devotees in a trance during a Hindu festival celebrated by the country’s ethnic Indian community. The Thaipusam festival was held last month. Era FM, the station owned by the country’s largest broadcaster, Astro Radio, deleted the video on the same day it was posted but not before it was widely viewed. Malaysia’s largest Indian political party, the Malaysian Indian Congress, condemned the clip as a blatant insult to Hinduism. Political analyst Azmil Tayeb said the incident reflected 'growing insensitivity that is the result of the polarization we are seeing' in Malaysian society. 'Every slight, perceived or otherwise, can easily trigger raw emotions and be seen as an attack against one’s community. Polarization hardens people’s sense of ethnic and religious identity,' Azmil, from Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Ethnic Malays comprise 70% of Malaysia’s population, followed by ethnic Chinese (22.6%) and ethnic Indians (6.6%). Rituals performed during Thaipusam hold deep significance for Hindu devotees. The festival honors a goddess’ gift of a spear to vanquish evil given to another. Devotees pierce their bodies with hooks and skewers while chanting 'Vel, Vel,' a reference to the sacred spear. That was the chant the radio station’s staff had mimicked in the video. Aziff Azuddin of IMAN Research, a local think-tank, said attacks on faiths were a result of ignorance and inter-ethnic resentment. 'Non-Muslims feel like their faith or way of living is increasingly being sidelined by the Muslim majority,' he told BenarNews. 'And the Muslim majority is increasingly feeling like non-Muslims are becoming more antagonistic toward them. Both things can be true at once.' Incident reports The three Era FM staff featured in the video posted an apology clip online and the station suspended them. The broadcasting, telecommunications and internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, on Wednesday issued a notice of intent to revoke the radio station’s license. Police Inspector-General Razaruddin Husain said police had received 73 reports about the video clip. 'The case is being investigated under Section 298 of the Penal Code for deliberately insulting other religions and Section 233 of the Communication Act. The case file has been handed to the Attorney General’s Chambers for further action,' the nation’s police chief told BenarNews. Gayathry Venkiteswaran, an analyst from the University of Nottingham Malaysia, raised concerns about the incident’s impact on the nation. 'It does set a bad precedent in the sense that it almost creates the kind of normalization of attacks against minorities,' Venkiteswaran, an assistant professor of media, languages and cultures, told BenarNews. And yet, she warned against legal action in such cases. 'Instead of taking the criminal investigation path, there has to be more public calling out of this behavior, more ethical responsibility from broadcasters and a stronger emphasis on professional conduct,' she said. Leaders must urge influential media figures to conduct themselves ethically, she added. '[This is] an opportunity for them to show how to have conversations about differences in society,' the professor said. Ongoing incidents In other action on Wednesday, the MCMC fined comedian Harith Iskandar and a Facebook user named Cecilia Yap 10,000 ringgit (U.S. $2,260) each for joking about a ham sandwich that a store, KK Mart, had labeled as halal in January. This incident was perceived as disrespecting Islam, because Muslims are forbidden from eating pork products such as ham, which means they are not halal. The owner of KK Mart and a supplier has been fined 60,000 ringgit ($13,550) last year for 'wounding religious feelings' by selling socks with the word 'Allah' printed on them. Last month, a grilled corn vendor was fined 400 ringgit ($90) for displaying a racially charged sign targeting the Indian community. In 2024, a movie director and producer were charged with allegedly 'wounding religious feelings' in a feature film about a young Muslim girl exploring other faiths. ‘Firm message’ Meanwhile on Thursday, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim warned citizens against using such incidents to stir up tensions. 'This is a firm message to all Malaysians to stop the culture of insulting any religion, culture, and ethnicity in any space in Malaysia,' his office said in a statement. 'Do not let petty issues weaken us at a time when the country is growing and on a good trajectory.'

Silenced And Struggling In Myanmar: How Polycrisis Fuels Period P...	By Naychi Thel Kyaw Tun Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) in Myanmar faces significant challenges due to the ongoing polycrisis: political turmoil, cultural taboos, economic constraints, and limited access to sanitation facilities, particularly in rural and conflict-affected areas. Key Takeaways: The Myanmar crisis, worsened by the military coup, has driven up the cost of menstrual products, making them unaffordable and forcing reliance on unhygienic alternatives, risking health and dignity. Cultural taboos and poor sanitation, especially in rural and conflict areas, limit access to menstrual products, leading to health risks and social isolation. Reusable products like cloth pads and cups offer a sustainable solution, but education and better sanitation are vital for widespread adoption in low-income and rural areas. Many women and girls struggle to afford disposable pads, leading to reliance on unhygienic alternatives, while inadequate waste management contributes to environmental pollution. The situation worsens in emergency settings, such as internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, where access to menstrual products and privacy is severely limited. Since the military coup in February 2021, Myanmar has experienced severe economic turmoil, leading to a sharp increase in the prices of essential goods, including menstrual hygiene products. Before the coup, a pack of eight to ten sanitary pads cost approximately 400 kyats. By mid-2024, the same pack will cost 1,500 and 2,000 kyats, representing a price surge of over 300%, according to Frontier Myanmar. Myanmar Fight For Period Poverty report by the Purple Feminists Group, published in February 2025, further highlights that nearly half of respondents spend between 1,000 and 5,000 kyats on disposable pads, while reusable products such as menstrual discs, cups, and tampons cost over 10,000 kyats, making them unaffordable for many low- and middle-income families. This sharp increase in menstrual product prices has exacerbated period poverty, making it increasingly difficult for women and girls to afford essential hygiene products. Although awareness of sustainable options like reusable cloth pads and menstrual cups is growing, cultural acceptance, affordability, and access to clean water remain barriers. A balanced approach is needed to address immediate menstrual needs and long-term sustainability, ensuring dignity, health, and environmental responsibility for women and girls across Myanmar. Immediate Needs in Urgent Situations In crisis settings, the priority is to provide women and girls with reliable and safe menstrual products to maintain their health and dignity. Disposable sanitary pads are often the go-to solution due to their ease of use and immediate availability. However, the distribution of these products in Myanmar's IDP camps has faced obstacles, including cultural stigmas and logistical challenges. A study on conflict and health highlighted that many women and girls in these camps lack access to adequate MHM materials and facilities, exacerbating health risks and social isolation. Myanmar Fight For Period Poverty report further emphasizes the struggles of menstruators in Myanmar, revealing that many lack awareness and access to proper menstrual products, leading to health risks and social stigmatization. The report calls for educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and dismantling of cultural stigmas to combat period poverty effectively. Disposable pads' immediate availability and convenience make them a practical option in emergencies. However, there are several challenges associated with their distribution and use. First, the cost of these products has increased dramatically, making it difficult for humanitarian organizations to provide them at scale. Second, many women in rural and displaced communities lack access to private and sanitary disposal facilities, leading to improper disposal methods that contribute to environmental pollution. Third, the stigma surrounding menstruation in Myanmar means that many women feel ashamed or embarrassed to ask for menstrual products, further limiting their access. To address these challenges, humanitarian organizations and government agencies must prioritize menstrual health in emergency response efforts. This includes ensuring the inclusion of menstrual products in aid packages, setting up designated safe spaces for menstrual hygiene management in IDP camps, and conducting awareness campaigns to break down cultural stigmas. Additionally, donors and international organizations must provide financial support for menstrual product distribution, helping offset the rising costs due to economic instability. Sustainable Solutions for Long-Term Impact While addressing immediate needs is crucial, it is equally important to consider the environmental impact and sustainability of menstrual products. Reusable options, such as cloth pads and menstrual cups, offer a viable alternative. These products reduce environmental waste and prove to be cost-effective over time. In Myanmar, initiatives have been launched to produce reusable sanitary pads locally, empowering women economically and providing a sustainable solution for menstrual hygiene. For instance, a pilot program from UNFPA trained women in IDP camps to manufacture 'Safepads,' reusable pads designed for day and night use. This initiative supplied necessary products and created income opportunities for the women involved. Reusable products offer multiple benefits beyond sustainability. First, they are cost-effective in the long run, reducing the financial burden on low-income families. A menstrual cup, for example, can last up to ten years, whereas disposable pads need to be purchased every month. Second, reusable products significantly reduce menstrual waste, helping to address the growing environmental concerns associated with disposable pads. Third, locally produced reusable pads can generate employment opportunities for women, fostering economic independence and empowerment. However, despite these advantages, there are still barriers to the widespread adoption of reusable menstrual products in Myanmar. Cultural resistance remains strong, with many women hesitant to use menstrual cups due to misconceptions and a lack of proper education on their benefits. Moreover, access to clean water and sanitation is a major concern, as proper hygiene practices are necessary to maintain reusable products safely. Reusable products may pose health risks without adequate washing facilities rather than serve as a sustainable solution. Targeted education and awareness campaigns are essential to encourage sustainable menstrual products. Schools and community groups should incorporate menstrual hygiene education into their programs, teaching young girls about the benefits and proper use of reusable products. Financial assistance programs should also be established to make these products accessible to low-income households. Government support is also critical, whether through subsidies, tax reductions on menstrual products, or investments in better sanitation infrastructure. However, the current political landscape in Myanmar can’t expect a government-led initiative for MHM either from State Administration Council (SAC) or the National Unity Government (NUG). Conclusion Balancing feasibility and sustainability in menstrual hygiene management in Myanmar requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Cultural acceptance remains a significant barrier, as menstrual cups and reusable pads may face resistance due to societal norms and misconceptions. Community education is essential to shift perceptions and promote the benefits of sustainable products. Access to clean water and sanitation is another crucial factor, as reusable products require proper cleaning, making disposable options more practical in areas lacking these facilities. Economic challenges also play a role, with the initial cost of reusable products posing a barrier for many women. Programs that subsidize these products or provide them for free can help alleviate this issue. Additionally, the environmental impact of disposable pads is substantial, making promoting reusable products a necessary step towards sustainability. A multi-faceted approach is needed to address the menstrual health crisis in Myanmar effectively. This includes emergency response efforts to provide immediate relief, long-term strategies to promote sustainable menstrual products, and policy reforms to improve overall menstrual health management. By tackling both the short-term and long-term challenges, Myanmar can ensure that all women and girls have access to safe, dignified, and sustainable menstrual hygiene solutions, regardless of their economic or social status.

The AI Boom And The Future Of Data Centers: How Artificial Intell...	The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an unprecedented surge in demand for high-performance computing power. At the heart of this revolution lies the data center, a critical infrastructure that enables AI development, cloud computing, and big data analytics. As AI-driven applications become more sophisticated, the need for advanced, scalable, and efficient data centers is growing at an exponential rate. This article explores the relationship between AI and data centers, analyzing how the AI boom is fueling a transformation in data center design, infrastructure, energy consumption, and the future of digital ecosystems. Understanding Data Centers and Their Role in AI A data center is a facility equipped with powerful servers, networking hardware, and storage systems designed to process and manage vast amounts of data. These centers serve as the backbone of modern computing, supporting applications ranging from enterprise cloud services to complex AI models. The increasing integration of AI technologies is pushing data centers to adopt more robust and efficient infrastructures to meet the growing computational demands. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), relies on massive datasets for training and inference. This process demands high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities, which are provided by data centers equipped with specialized AI hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and custom AI accelerators. AI workloads require: High computational power for training deep neural networks. Scalable storage solutions to handle large datasets. High-speed networking to facilitate rapid data transfers. Efficient cooling systems to manage the heat generated by AI processors. The Growth of AI-Driven Data Centers The AI revolution is significantly impacting data center growth in several key ways: 1. Hyperscale Data Centers Hyperscale data centers are massive facilities designed to accommodate large-scale computing workloads. These centers are primarily operated by tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, all of whom are investing billions in building AI-ready data centers worldwide. AI-driven businesses require greater scalability, leading to the rise of massive hyperscale facilities with thousands of interconnected servers. These data centers use advanced cooling techniques, including liquid cooling and immersion cooling, to handle AI's intensive processing requirements. The need for high-speed, low-latency networking is driving investments in fiber-optic networks and edge computing solutions. 2. Edge Computing and AI While hyperscale data centers dominate AI development, edge computing is playing an increasing role in real-time AI applications. Edge computing brings computational power closer to end-users, reducing latency and improving performance for AI-driven technologies such as: Autonomous vehicles, which require instant processing of sensor data. Smart cities, where AI processes video surveillance, traffic management, and energy distribution in real-time. IoT devices, including smart appliances, medical devices, and industrial automation systems. As AI applications proliferate, data centers must evolve to incorporate edge computing nodes, creating a decentralized computing ecosystem that enhances efficiency and responsiveness. 3. Energy Demands and Sustainability Challenges One of the biggest challenges of AI-driven data centers is energy consumption. AI models require enormous processing power, leading to higher electricity usage and increased environmental impact. According to estimates, AI workloads could consume up to 20% of global electricity by 2030 if sustainable solutions are not implemented. To address these challenges, companies are: Investing in renewable energy-powered data centers, utilizing solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Exploring small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) as a stable energy source for high-performance computing. Implementing AI-driven energy optimization to reduce power consumption through smart cooling systems and energy-efficient hardware. 4. The Role of AI in Optimizing Data Centers Interestingly, AI itself is being used to enhance data center operations. AI-driven management systems analyze real-time data to optimize cooling, power distribution, and resource allocation. Some key AI applications in data centers include: AI-based cooling systems, which dynamically adjust temperatures to maximize efficiency. Predictive maintenance, where AI detects hardware failures before they occur, reducing downtime. Workload distribution, where AI directs computational tasks to the most energy-efficient servers, minimizing power wastage. Companies like Google have already implemented AI-driven cooling management, reducing energy consumption by up to 40% in some data centers. The Future of Data Centers in the Age of AI As AI continues to evolve, data centers will undergo further transformations to support emerging technologies. Several key trends will shape the future of AI-driven data centers: 1. AI-Optimized Hardware and Chips Traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs) are no longer sufficient for AI workloads. Instead, specialized AI chips are becoming the new standard. Companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD are developing AI-optimized processors, including: Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), designed for deep learning tasks. Neuromorphic chips, which mimic the human brain's neural processing. Quantum computing, which has the potential to revolutionize AI training by exponentially increasing processing speeds. 2. AI-Powered Data Centers as a Service (DCaaS) The concept of Data Center as a Service (DCaaS) is gaining momentum, where businesses can rent AI-optimized computing resources from cloud providers instead of building their own infrastructure. This allows startups and enterprises to scale their AI operations without massive capital investment in hardware. Cloud-based AI training enables researchers and companies to train models remotely. AIaaS (AI as a Service) provides pre-trained models and computing power to organizations without requiring on-premises infrastructure. Serverless AI computing allows businesses to deploy AI applications dynamically, only using computational power when needed. 3. The Rise of Modular and Self-Sustaining Data Centers To improve scalability and sustainability, the data center industry is shifting towards modular designs that can be deployed quickly and efficiently. Prefabricated data centers are gaining popularity, allowing organizations to establish AI-ready infrastructure in record time. Additionally, companies are investing in self-sustaining data centers that operate independently of traditional power grids. Some innovative approaches include: Underwater data centers, which use ocean water for cooling. AI-driven microgrids, which generate their own electricity using renewable sources. Bio-computing, where AI models are run using biological processors instead of silicon-based chips. Conclusion The boom of artificial intelligence is reshaping the landscape of data centers, driving demand for more powerful, scalable, and sustainable infrastructure. Hyperscale data centers are expanding, edge computing is becoming essential, and new energy-efficient solutions are being developed to handle the surge in AI workloads. At the same time, AI itself is revolutionizing how data centers operate, optimizing energy use, managing workloads, and ensuring reliability. As we move forward, the synergy between AI and data centers will continue to evolve, creating a new era of intelligent, efficient, and self-sustaining digital infrastructure. The future of AI depends on data centers, and the future of data centers depends on innovation in AI—a cycle of continuous progress that will define the next phase of the digital revolution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufvhg6exDPqRd	2025-03-06T17:43:20-08:00	
Ukraine’s Reputation For Corruption Is Legion: Has It Gotten Bett...	By Mike Eckel and Heorhiy Shabayev (RFE/RL) -- Before he was appointed head of Ukraine’s Anti-Monopoly Committee in 2023, Pavlo Kyrylenko served as the top official in the Donetsk regional administration, overseeing the Ukrainian-controlled parts of a region partially occupied by Russian forces. During that time, his in-laws were also real estate investors, acquiring 21 properties including commercial office space, land plots, and apartments in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Uzhhorod. His wife, whose relatives’ names appeared on the property ownership papers, also drove a luxury BMW X3 sport utility vehicle. To make matters worse, there were major omissions on his legally required financial disclosure forms. Moreover, his wife did not appear to have any income that would legitimately explain how they acquired 70 million hryvnias (around $1.8 million) in assets. Those revelations, first made by Schemes, RFE/RL’s Ukrainian investigative unit , ultimately led to Kyrylenko being charged with 'illegal enrichment' and 'declaration of false information.' A modest victory for anti-corruption campaigners, Kyrylenko’s charges were another reminder of the issue that Ukraine has been struggling with for a decade or more: endemic, prolific corruption, in the public and private sectors. 'Obviously, we still have a lot of work to do. That’s correct, and of course there is still corruption in Ukraine,' said Daria Kalenyuk, a respected activist and executive director of the Kyiv-based Anti-Corruption Action Center, which was founded in 2012. 'However, I can compare today with what was here 13 years ago…and it's like the results are unbelievable.' Corruption Scandals Three years into Russia’s all-out invasion, Ukrainian society continues on a war footing, galvanized to support the armed forces in the fight against an external, existential threat -- while also rallying behind President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s wartime leadership. But corruption remains a persistent internal threat, illustrated by a series of scandals in recent years involving the Defense Ministry, national prosecutors, and wealthy businessmen. The predecessor to the current defense minister lost his job due to a scandal involving inflated food prices. 'It's good that it is possible in Ukraine, during the [fourth] year of the large-scale invasion, to actually freely expose corruption, and that there are tools which allow [people] to do that,' she told RFE/RL. 'So it's actually an indication that we have an open society and still a system of checks and balances, that we are a free country, free society.' The struggle to clean up the country’s reputation as a swamp has been messy at times, said Andriy Borovyk, the executive director of the corruption watchdog, Transparency International Ukraine. But not every mess is necessarily a sign of corruption, he said. 'Should we talk about corruption during war? I think yes -- it’s necessary,' Borovyk told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service. 'But in Ukrainian society, there’s a tendency to label any inefficiency or stupidity as corruption right away. That’s just how things are perceived here.' 'Yes, corruption must be exposed, but not every inefficiency should be immediately equated with corruption,' he said. Wartime Corruption Under Zelenskyy Disgust with graft is often cited as one of the leading causes for the 2013-2014 Maidan demonstrations, where thousands of Ukrainians took to Kyiv’s streets for months to protest. After President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February 2014, and Russia launched a campaign of covert and overt military action in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine’s military struggled to mount an effective defense, in some cases lacking weaponry that had been contracted but never supplied. The problem was largely attributed to graft. For many, the nadir came with the post-Maidan discoveries at Yanukovych’s Versailles-like complex called Mezhyhirya , where he built an opulent mansion along with guesthouses, lakes, a collection of classic luxury cars, and a dock with a mock 18th century Spanish warship. Zelenskyy’s landslide election victory in 2019 was widely seen as another push to try to move society beyond old habits: away from bribery and kickbacks -- big and small -- and toward transparency and accountability. Russia’s war has made it more difficult. During the invasion, defense planners have been raked over the coals for several eye-popping procurement scandals -- something that appears to resonate more deeply with Ukrainians eager to support the armed forces. Military contracts had been classified following the 2022 invasion. However, that changed in January 2023, when investigative reporters found a military supplier who was charging the government nearly 2 1/2 times the retail price for eggs. Schemes later found additional contracts with suppliers wxho were providing the armed forces with food items at above-market rates. Public pressure led to Zelenskyy sacking Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov in September 2023. Under pressure from the United States and Western countries aiding Ukraine, the Zelenskyy government set up a specialized entity -- the Defense Procurement Agency -- to streamline how weaponry was contracted, purchased, and supplied. On January 28, 2025, the Cabinet fired a deputy defense minister as part of a shake-up of the procurement operations. That same day , the National Anti-Corruption Bureau -- a dedicated graft-fighting law enforcement agency -- opened a criminal probe of Umerov for refusing to extend Bezrukova’s contract . But Reznikov’s successor as defense minister, Rustem Umerov, criticized the Defense Procurement Agency for what he said was inefficiency and lax governance. Defenders of its director, Maryna Bezrukova, who took over in early 2024, said she helped clean up a murky but essential system. 'Unfortunately, monitoring defense expenditures remains a highly opaque process, and the public learns about irregularities only in isolated cases,' said Serhiy Mytkalyk, who heads a nongovernmental organization called Anti-Corruption Headquarters. How Corrupt Is Ukraine? Transparency International, whose corruption perception ratings are closely watched around the world, said Ukraine had improved markedly in recent years due to 'reforms aimed at European integration and the fulfillment of international obligations.' However, the country slipped last year, the group said, due to reforms 'being implemented only formally,' or the implementation was 'being deliberately stalled.'Overall, Ukraine rated in 105th place out of 180 countries in the organization’s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index -- ahead of Russia and Belarus, but behind Moldova, Hungary, and Romania. The United States was in 28th place. Last year, Dmytro Verbytskiy, a top official in the national Prosecutor-General’s Office, was found to be living in a rented suburban townhouse that his nephew had bought at a grossly underpriced value, according to another Schemes investigation. Schemes also discovered evidence suggesting the nephew was in fact a straw-man buyer, secretly representing an Odesa businessman. Experts said the arrangement might constitute tax evasion, though the deputy prosecutor denied wrongdoing. Schemes later uncovered details about Verbytskiy’s girlfriend, who in 2024 became the owner of a new Porsche automobile and a 3-story cottage in the same tony subdivision where Verbytskiy was living—even though her declared income was substantially lower. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau later launched a criminal investigation into Verbytskiy’s assets. Weeks after the revelations, and the subsequent investigation, Verbytskiy officially resigned from the prosecutor’s office. Anti-corruption activist Kalenyuk argued the fact that these scandals and investigations are in the public eye wasn’t a sign of unremitting corruption; rather, she said, it was a healthy sign that Ukrainian public and civil society were reacting to the problem. 'It's like saying that there is no corruption in Belarus. Nobody is talking about corruption in Belarus, absolutely nobody. But it doesn't mean that there is no corruption,' she said. 'It just means that if you are talking about corruption in Belarus, you will be jailed, tortured, extorted, imprisoned, intimidated, killed, whatever.' As for Kyrylenko, who was charged with 'illegal enrichment' for his shady property deals, prosecutors requested he be detained, but instead the court ordered him released on August 28, 2024, pending trial, with an electronic monitoring bracelet, and bail of 30 million hryvnia ($730,000). The bail, Schemes found , was paid not by Kyrylenko, however, but by a businessman that owns a company currently under investigation by a regional unit of the Anti-Monopoly Committee. Mike Eckel is a senior international correspondent reporting on political and economic developments in Russia, Ukraine, and around the former Soviet Union, as well as news involving cybercrime and espionage. He's reported on the ground on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the wars in Chechnya and Georgia, and the 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, as well as the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Why We’re Stuck With The Term ‘Classical Liberalism’ – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken Near the beginning of his ten-hour lecture series on the history of political thought, the great free-market historian Ralph Raico takes a little time to define his terms. In the first lecture he says: 'What I’m going to be discussing this week is classical liberalism. I might slip and just call it liberalism from time to time, but you’ll understand what I’m saying. We’ll be discussing its growth, its development, and finally, I’ll say something about the possible future of liberalism.' As the lectures progress, it becomes apparent that Raico is using the term liberalism to mean the philosophy of freedom and laissez-faire. To many average Americans who think of themselves as being of the party of freedom and free markets, they may think this is rather odd. Many Americans in this group—especially the variety who are not prone to reading history books—might be confused by this. After all, don’t talk show hosts like Sean Hannity use the term 'liberal' to describe todays social democrats? Isn’t it proper to use the term 'conservative' to describe the free-market group? If one tends to think of the 1940s as the murky, distant past, then yes, the current use of the terms 'conservative' and 'liberal' seems fine. On the other hand, for people who actually study history and try to make sense of intellectual movement and their origins, it is usually obvious that the way the term 'liberal' is used by pundits at Fox News and MSNBC simply doesn’t work. This is because the term 'liberal,' as used by people in the past, clearly meant the party of freedom and free markets. The term 'conservative,' meanwhile, denotes no specific ideological content, and depends on which country one is talking about. The post-1945 ideological movement we now call 'conservative' has never really been an heir to the classical liberals. This can be seen in the American conservative movement’s obsession with war, and in the fact that its founder, William F. Buckley, literally supported the adoption of militarist totalitarianism. Indeed, the free-market aspect of conservatism was never more than a thin patina applied to the movement to help the conservative leaders attract the disaffected free-market supporters of the Old Right. American conservatism in practice has never prioritized freedom as historical liberals have. Indeed, some of the conservative movement’s own theorists, such as Russell Kirk, explicitly sought to separate the conservative movement from the free-market liberals of the nineteenth century. (See Kirk’s book The Conservative Mind.) To describe a free-market person as 'conservative' in 1910 or 1850 would have just been confusing to everyone involved. Libertarianism is the Radical Wing of Classical Liberalism This is an important issue for libertarians since, as Raico shows, the ideology we call 'libertarianism' is simply the radical wing of the intellectual movement known as classical liberalism. This, however, hasn’t stopped many modern day classical liberalism and libertarians from claiming that there is some sort of bright shining line between libertarians and free-market liberals. Often, the claim is that libertarians and classical liberals are fundamentally incompatible because libertarians are all supposedly hard-core anarcho-capitalists while classical liberals demand the existence of a state. This attempt at inserting a hard separation between the two groups does not survive a look at the historical reality, however. For instance, we can find plenty of theorists with anarchist views who were well ensconced and highy influential in liberal circles. Perhaps most notable is Gustave de Molinari, the grand old man of liberalism by the late nineteenth century, but also arguably the first anarcho-capitalist. Molinari denied that a state was necessary and generally took a very radical laissez-faire, anti-statist view. He was also the editor of the flagship liberal journal Journal des Économistes for decades. It would be absurd to claim that Molinari cannot be counted among the liberals because of his anarchist views. We might also look to Jean-Baptiste Say who was clear that he did not regard the state as necessary. It’s hard to overstate Say’s prestige and influence among liberals in the nineteenth century. Yet, he was clearly part of the liberal world, and it makes no sense to claim that his anarchist statements somehow render him not a part of the liberal movement. J.B. Say, like Molinari, was clearly both a libertarian and a classical liberal. We might make similar observations about Herbert Spencer. Spencer, of course, famously wrote an anarchist essay on the right to ignore the state. Was Spencer therefore not a liberal? That would be news to most of the liberals of Spencer’s time. Spencer was one of the radicals, and as such, was a libertarian. But he was hardly outside the liberal movement. As with every other intellectual movement, there were some who were more moderate than others. The breadth and radicalism of some corners of the classical liberal movement should now make it all the more clear how incoherent it would be to apply a term like 'conservative' to describe this group. To apply the term 'conservative' to theorists like Spencer, Say, or Molinari should strike us as laughable. Because of this, Raico has even gone so far as to use the terms 'classical liberal' and 'libertarian' as near synonyms. This is fitting given how even the more moderate classical liberals of the past—such as Adam Smith—would be considered free-market extremists by today’s political standards. In this sense, the term libertarian can indeed serve as a substitute for classical liberal. Why Surrender the Term to the Left? Even with 'libertarian' as a serviceable substitute for 'liberalism,' properly understood, that’s not a good enough reason to simply let the Left have it. Yes, handing over the term 'liberal' to be the exclusive property of the democratic socialists may seem no big deal to people who rarely read about the past as it was before living memory. But, it is a serious problem for people who actually try to think systematically about the origins of modern political and intellectual movements. It doesn’t work to describe the Lockeans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as 'liberals' on one page, and to then describe people with the same beliefs as something else entirely a few paragraphs later—simply because that second group of people happened to live in the twentieth century. This is a formula for creating what Raico calls 'conceptual mayhem' in which the term 'liberalism' means both the ideology of Hillary Clinton and the Ideology of Thomas Jefferson. If we use the word this way, then it has no useful meaning at all. This is how we ended up with the term 'classical liberal' in the first place. Recognizing that there is no suitable substitute term for the ideology of laissez-faire, some commentators attempted to deal with this mayhem. 'Classical liberalism' is an awkward phrase, but is used out of necessity. The added adjective 'classical'—which is essentially a synonym of 'traditional'— is used as a makeshift solution to the abuse of the term 'liberal' in recent decades. That’s why we have it. The whole reason this even became necessary, of course, is because social democrats stole the term to describe their own ideology back in the first half of the twentieth century. As Raico shows, this was done deliberately because liberalism was extremely popular at the time, and it made a lot of sense to poach the word and apply it to the Left’s unliberal ideologies. Raico writes: In a famous passage [Joseph Schumpeter] ironically states that it was a kind of compliment, if an unintended one, when the enemies of the system of free enterprise confiscated the name liberal for what was basically the opposite of what liberalism had stood for from the start. Nowadays, you can find writers who express astonishment that free market economists still sometimes insist on calling themselves liberals rather than conservatives. Some might say why argue over a name, why not just call your position anything at all and go on from there to argue the case for it? Stephen Holmes, a political scientist from Chicago, has called the dispute over the term 'liberal' a matter of bragging rights; the right to brag 'I’m the real liberal in the liberal tradition and you’re not.' On the other hand, he insists that he’s in the real liberal tradition and thinks it’s worth arguing about. Raico notes here that scholars on the Left—that is, the social democrats—aren’t willing to give the term back to the laissez-faire party, and think it’s worth fighting to retain control of the term. On the other hand, many free-market people—who generally seem to lack the savvy and drive of their enemies on the Left—can’t be bothered with fighting for proper terminology. Instead, I often hear from free-market activists that we should just adopt another term. Perhaps 'voluntarist' or 'individualist.' Both terms, of course, conceptually sever the link between modern laissez-faire liberals and their 400-year history. That’s part of the Left’s plan. The Left wants use to believe that modern social democrats like John Maynard Keynes are the real liberals and the inheritors of the the tradition of 'liberty' pushed by the revered American revolutionaries. This is completely false, of course, but by controlling the word 'liberal,' the left can also distance the true party of freedom from its own historical patrimony. Moreover, if a new term for the laissez-party actually becomes popular, the Left will just try to expropriate that term, too. This already happened with the term 'individualist' as Raico notes: some of the English old-fashioned liberals like Auberon Herbert and the extreme followers of Herbert Spencer started saying 'let’s call ourselves something else, let’s call ourselves individualists.' Then, John Dewey started saying 'well, you know, there was an old individualism that is now obsolete.' Dewey then went on to say that his leftwing ideology was the real individualism. Indeed, surrendering to the Left on definitions and terminology just encourages the Left to keep poaching popular words. Basically, every time a self-described 'conservative' uses the term 'liberal' to describe a Leftist social democrat, he is basically saying 'yes, I agree to discuss everything using the terms and definitions dictated by the Left.' We have already made a big concession by using the modifier 'classical' at all. Alas, we are forced into it because the social democrats who now call themselves 'liberals' have long controlled the media and academia, and those groups have tremendous influence in the public’s use of words. Words Have Meanings But, if the real liberals, the real party of laissez-faire, simply abandons the term, it will become next to impossible to construct a coherent historical narrative about the party of freedom and free markets. That’s what the Left wants, of course, but we don’t have to go along with it. Raico concludes: I submit that there is no intellectually honest reason to bestow the term liberal on those nowadays who favor a never-ending list of government funded programs. These programs, we are told, are necessary to deal with every real or imagined ill of society and favor a constantly expanding state apparatus to wage war on the traditional ways and values of civil society. The people who support this are the people who are called liberal nowadays. The 'new' liberalism of Hobhouse and Hobson is indistinguishable from the position, for instance, of Eduard Bernstein, the founder of the vision of socialism in Germany. This has today become socialism altogether in the modern world, just as the position of American liberal intellectuals is indistinguishable from that of people who call themselves social democrats in Europe. ... The working definition of liberalism that I will adopt is this: it is the ideology that holds that civil society—understood as a sum order of society, the sum of the social order minus the state—by and large runs itself within the bounds of a principle of private property. This is liberalism as I’ll be discussing it here. Raico is right. We might still have to add on the word 'classical' on occasion to help along those with a weaker grasp of history. But 'liberal' remains the only truly accurate and consistent term for the ideology of freedom and free markets.

Stop Moving Clocks Back And Forth And Go With Standard Time – OpE...	Daylight saving time returns at 2 a.m. on Sunday. Unless Congress stops the madness of springing forward and falling back every year, it will end Nov. 2, when standard time resumes. Twenty states have proposed or enacted legislation to implement daylight saving time permanently. But those laws cannot go into effect until Congress amends or repeals the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which established the current twice-yearly clock change regime. We’ve been here before. The United States adopted year-round daylight saving time during the two global wars of the 20th century and again starting on Jan. 6, 1974. Both policies were justified as a means of saving not time, but energy. When the U.S. Department of Energy finally studied the issue in 2008—a four-week extension of daylight saving time mandated by an amendment to the 1966 Uniform Time Act—the energy savings were found to be trivial: 0nly about a 0.03 percent reduction in national energy consumption. Subsequent research, including a 2010 study by environmental economists Matthew Kotchen of Yale and Laura Grant, then with the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates daylight saving time actually 'increases electricity demand.' Significantly, 1974’s permanent experiment with daylight saving time ended after just eight months. Though intended to last two years, it was canceled in response to strong opposition from parents who objected to sending their children to school in the dark during late fall and early winter. According to Time magazine, 'Eight children in Florida were involved in pre-dawn car accidents in the wake of the time change, leading a TV commentator to coin the phrase ‘daylight disaster time.’' Daylight saving time has other serious dark sides. Springing clocks forward one hour in March causes worrisome physical and mental health effects, including spikes in heart attacks, strokes and automobile accidents. Sleep deprivation makes people groggy, less focused and less productive on the job until they adjust to the time change. Those adjustments take longer at older ages. The adverse health consequences of daylight saving time explain why the American Medical Association and many sleep specialists and physiologists recommend staying on standard time throughout the calendar year. Standard time aligns the human body more closely with the sun. Sunlight optimally sets our body clocks (circadian rhythms). The Uniform Time Act of 1966 permits individual states to adopt standard time year-round without congressional action. But only Hawaii, parts of Arizona (areas beyond the borders of the Navajo Nation, which comprises 27,000 square miles of that state plus portions of Utah and New Mexico) and the outlying U.S. territories do not observe daylight saving time. So Arizona operates under two different time regimes from March to November: DST for those living on the reservation and standard time for everyone else. The number of hours the sun is shining has nothing to do with where the hands of the clock point. The season, and the arc distance from the equator to your location on the globe, determine the length of the day. The benefits to after-work golfers and others who like longer sunlit evenings hardly justify the substantial costs of the twice-yearly time changes the rest of us are forced to bear. If people want to shop or play golf after work, they can leave their offices earlier in the afternoon when the day already is longer at northern latitudes. In the late 19th century, the railroads adopted the convention of 'standard time,' which is now in effect for a ridiculously brief four months every year. Standard time and geographically defined time zones helped shippers and passengers easily and more accurately plan departures and arrivals. Daylight saving time abruptly shifts most Americans one time zone to the east. Why? Daylight saving time does not 'save' anything. We’ve tried permanent daylight saving time nationwide before. Repeating the same policy mistake and expecting a different outcome is one definition of insanity. Permanent standard time is the best way of resolving the current debate.

End The DC Hold ‘Em Game – OpEd	In its first hearing, the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) cited 'hundreds of billions of taxpayers’ dollars wasted on improper payments and fraud.' The DOGE revelations include $20 billion at the Environmental Protection Agency, money the EPA bosses 'knew they were wasting.' With April 15 looming, taxpayers should be aware of one reason such colossal waste occurs: the government gets their money before they do. As Robert Higgs (Crisis and Leviathan) explains, this is a relatively new development. Before World War II, individuals who owed federal tax on their income paid during the following year in quarterly installments. As Higgs explains, 'Wars have always been the most important occasions for the introduction of new forms of taxation.' A gigantic global war imposed huge revenue demands, so the government devised a plan to withhold tax from workers’ paychecks. One of the architects of this system was economist Milton Friedman, who admitted that he helped 'develop machinery that would make possible a government that I would come to criticize severely as too large, too intrusive, too destructive of freedom.' Withholding was supposedly a wartime measure, but the government conveniently kept it in place. Higgs cites the observation of Charlotte Twight in Dependent on D.C. that 'withholding is the paramount administrative mechanism that since 1943 has enabled the federal government to collect, without significant protest, sufficient private resources to fund a vastly expanded welfare state.' As DOGE now reveals, the welfare state is also an expanded, wasteful state. Politicians and government bureaucrats appear to believe they have a prior claim to what American workers earn. As a matter of right, everything a worker earns belongs to the worker. The so-called 'take-home pay' is what remains after the government grabs the worker’s money first. Workers should get everything they earn and pay their income taxes in quarterly installments, just as freelance writers and other self-employed Americans do now. Writing quarterly checks to the government will raise consciousness of how much the government is taking. Thanks to DOGE, the people are learning how much of their money the government is wasting. Judging by their shrill complaints, government bureaucrats seem to think there’s something wrong with accountability. Musk’s demand for them to show five accomplishments from the previous week really set them off. Imagine if that email had shown up with John Beale, once the highest-paid employee at the Environmental Protection Agency. In his long career, Beale never produced anything of value. With degrees in political science, administration, and law, Beale boasted little if any scientific expertise for his job as a 'senior policy adviser' in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. In 1994, Beale told his bosses he was a secret agent for the CIA, but nobody at the EPA bothered to check. While claiming to be in London, India, and Pakistan, Beale was actually performing no work of any kind. He pulled off the CIA ruse for nearly 20 years, bilking taxpayers of nearly $1 million, and even got retention bonuses after he retired. For details, see the hearings shown on C-SPAN. This all went down at the EPA, whose bosses knew they were wasting $20 billion. Taxpayers can be forgiven for thinking the Department of Justice should look into it. As DOGE reveals fathomless waste and fraud, President Trump should push for the elimination of tax withholding at first opportunity. The Internal Revenue Service—bloated by $80 billion under Biden’s 'Inflation Reduction Act,' should not get taxpayers’ money before the workers who earned it. That will restrain government power and help prevent waste, fraud and abuse from happening in the first place.

Is This What Winning Looks Like? – OpEd	If this is winning, it is less fun than I had hoped. The confirmation hearings for Jay Bhattacharya as secretary of the National Institutes of Health just ended. They were short, just two hours from soup to nuts. Nothing played out like I had expected. And yet, now that I think about it, it played out exactly as I should have expected. Jay’s erudition, humility, and sincerity carried the day. His vast knowledge of medicine, science, and economics is worn casually, but it is unmistakable. It’s inconceivable that political actors could possibly match it. That is known and obvious. My main interest in watching was in hope of something approaching a real debate over Covid policy, 2020-2023 (and, in some ways, continuing in new iterations). After all, that is why he was in this seat. The previous administration specifically targeted him, calling him a 'fringe epidemiologist' and sought to censor his opinions. As time went on and the historical trajectory flipped, this quiet academic who stood up for principle when it mattered has found himself picked to head the world’s most powerful scientific agency. One might suppose – if society and politics work as one might intuitively think they should – that there would now be a big discussion and debate on lockdowns, with both sides allowed to speak. Maybe this would be the reckoning we’ve all long awaited. Instead, there was no discussion and no debate at all. The Democratic side of the aisle did not bring it up once. Three Republicans did and briefly. Jay reiterated what he has said for years and what was stated in the Great Barrington Declaration. His position is clear. The role of science is to advise people based on evidence. It is not to use force to interfere with people’s freedoms. Public health agencies should never have pushed school, business, and church closures, nor forced human separation and masks, and so on. He said this clearly, inclusive of vaccine mandates. 'Science should be an engine for knowledge and freedom, not something that stands on top of society and says you must do this or else.' 'It shouldn’t be pushing Covid vaccines.' 'The proper role of scientists in a pandemic is to answer basic questions that policy makers have about what the right policy should be.' 'The role of scientists shouldn’t be to say you can’t send your kids to school for two years.' 'If science is a force for freedom and knowledge, it will have universal support.' There was zero pushback from the other side. They might as well have had their fingers in their ears. There was a change of subject, almost a desperate one. No one took issue with a word he said on this subject. Instead, the only subject from the Democratic side was pressing to make sure that the money keeps flowing out of the NIH to the research centers in their states. Are we supposed to believe that the new orthodoxy is that the Covid response was a disaster? No one said that but Jay, Rand Paul, and two other Republicans. From the other side, there was not even a breath of contradiction. At the same time, there were no apologies, no admissions of stupidity, no granting that mistakes were made. Instead, we got silence on the whole topic that even the New York Times now admits is the single most important topic of our times. After all, the Covid response did in fact set the world on fire. It is a main cause of the utter collapse in the prestige of experts in many sectors, if not all sectors. It’s a central reason why people don’t trust their doctors, why the media is in such disrepute, why the politicians are met with such incredulity. It’s the major contributing factor for ill-health, illiteracy, depression, substance abuse, economic dislocation, job insecurity, and cultural despair. And yet, we seem to be at a stalemate. The proponents of the response – or those who simply chose to look the other way – don’t want the subject to come up ever again. It is an affected amnesia. The people who were demonized all along and now turn out to be right want to debate but cannot find any sparring partners. We won the match but the bell never rang. The purpose of the bell is to prevent an ambush from behind, which is precisely why this studied silence is so alarming. What happens when a new virus comes along, real, manufactured, or imagined? We have no real statements saying that there will not be a repeat. The existing policy is still what it was: lockdown until vaccination. To be sure, with Jay and RFK and others now in the driver’s seat, this is less likely to go down the same way. And yet if you look at the handling of the Bird flu, you see the same strategies being deployed in ways that have affected prices and the food supply. Authorities want every bird slaughtered if one tests positive. They feed tax dollars to pharmaceutical companies to develop and distribute livestock vaccines. There has been no change in the policy concerning PCR testing and what that implies for the animals. Meanwhile, just before inauguration, the HHS, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Interior cooperated in pushing out the first-ever One Health policy for the US, working directly with the WHO, which the US has supposedly left. In other words, there is no real change in the policy or the orthodoxy. One reason for that is precisely because of the absence of real public discussion and debate. If such a debate did occur, and if our leaders would at least be open and honest about this calamity (even if they still defend it), we might finally make progress toward putting the world back together again. As it stands, there are too many unanswered questions, too much pent-up anger, too much uncertainty about precisely how governments plan to manage pandemics, whether they affect humans or livestock. It simply will not do to pretend that none of this happened and hope it goes away once people are tired of the subject, forget, and push back the trauma into the recesses of the public mind. This is all too dishonest for a civilized people. Jay wanted that debate. His interrogators did not. Again, this is not the way winning should feel. Brownstone Institute’s 10-part history could not have come at a better time. We need more than the right people in high-profile positions. We need a completely new paradigm, which cannot really take hold until that reckoning finally does occur. That begins with frankness and an end to the silence. Below is an AI-generated reconstruction of Jay’s opening statement. Reconstructed Opening Statement by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, March 5, 2025 Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Hearing Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, and distinguished members of this committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as President Trump’s nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health. It is an honor to be considered for this role at an institution that has long been the crown jewel of American biomedical science—a place with a storied history of supporting breakthroughs that have saved countless lives and deepened our understanding of human health. But today, that legacy is at a crossroads. American health is in decline. During the Covid-19 pandemic, life expectancy in the United States plunged, and it has yet to recover. Hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens—adults and children alike—are grappling with a crisis of chronic diseases: obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. These conditions are robbing us of our vitality and our future. At the same time, public trust in science and medicine has eroded, shaken by a series of missteps and a growing perception that our institutions prioritize conformity over truth. The NIH, as the world’s preeminent health research agency, must rise to meet these challenges. But it cannot do so effectively under the shadow of its recent past. Over the last few years, top NIH officials oversaw a culture of coverup, obfuscation, and intolerance for ideas that diverged from their own. We’ve seen this in the dismissal of legitimate scientific debate during the pandemic, and we’ve seen it in scandals like the fraudulent Alzheimer’s research that undermined confidence in NIH-funded science. This must change. If confirmed, I pledge to restore the NIH to its foundational mission: funding the most innovative, cutting-edge research to deliver transformative advances in human health—not just incremental steps, but bold leaps forward. My plan is to ensure that NIH invests in science that is replicable, reproducible, and generalizable—science we can trust. Too much of modern biomedical research fails this basic test, and we owe the American people better. Central to this vision is a commitment to free speech and scientific dissent. Dissent is not a threat to science—it is the very essence of science. For too long, the NIH has stifled disagreement, sidelining early-career scientists and others who dared to question the orthodoxy. I will establish a culture of respect where all ideas can be expressed and debated openly, because that is how we uncover truth. This is not just a principle; it is a necessity if we are to rebuild the public’s faith in our work. I also share Secretary Kennedy’s urgency in confronting the chronic disease crisis. American health is going backwards, and the NIH must lead the way forward by investigating the root causes of these conditions and developing solutions that prevent and reverse them. This will require rigorous oversight of research that could pose risks—such as studies with pandemic potential—while ensuring the vast majority of NIH work continues to advance the public good. The NIH’s nearly $48 billion budget is a sacred trust, supporting over 300,000 researchers worldwide. If confirmed, I will steward those resources with care, prioritizing innovation over bureaucracy and ensuring that every dollar serves the mission of making Americans healthier. Together with this administration, we can return the NIH to its gold standard—delivering discoveries that improve lives, save lives, and, yes, make America healthy again.

Artificial Intelligence And The Fate Of The Human Imagination: A ...	The incursion of artificial intelligence (AI) into the domains of literature and the arts poses profound existential and epistemological questions. It unsettles our deepest assumptions about creativity, consciousness, and the very nature of human expression. As machines increasingly encroach upon the spaces once considered the sanctuaries of human uniqueness, the creative landscape experiences both an expansion and an erosion. AI serves as both muse and menace, liberating and shackling, augmenting and obfuscating the intricate web of the human psyche. This article offers a psychoanalytic and philosophical meditation on the ramifications of AI's presence in literature and the arts, dissecting its promises and perils. The Machine as the New Muse: The Expansion of the Creative Process From a Freudian perspective, creativity emerges from the dynamic interplay between the unconscious and conscious mind. It is a sublimation of drives, an elaborate dance between the id, ego, and superego. AI, by introducing an externalized mechanism of creativity, extends this dialectic beyond the individual, offering an additional layer to the creative psyche. Instead of serving as a passive tool, AI functions as a collaborator—suggesting, modifying, and even generating aesthetic products. The subconscious mind, once constrained by the individual's linguistic and cognitive limits, finds in AI an endless associative engine, capable of producing variations upon variations of thought. Philosophically, AI engenders a new form of authorship. If the Derridean notion of différance suggests that meaning is always deferred, existing in an endless play of signifiers, then AI's capacity to endlessly iterate creative works becomes the ultimate realization of this concept. The human artist is no longer a singular origin of meaning but rather a navigator amidst an ocean of algorithmic possibilities. In this sense, AI does not replace creativity; it amplifies it, extending the horizon of what can be imagined and constructed. The Aesthetic Singularity: AI and the Death of the Artist Yet, as AI expands creative possibilities, it also challenges the ontological status of the artist. The Romantic ideal of the solitary genius—haunted, inspired, forging the new from the abyss of the self—stands in stark contrast to the mechanized, iterative processes of AI. If AI can generate poetry, paintings, and novels with an efficiency that surpasses human labor, does this herald the obsolescence of the human artist? Lacanian psychoanalysis suggests that subjectivity is formed through lack—the recognition that one is incomplete, forever seeking an unattainable fullness. Human creativity, therefore, is the expression of this lack, a striving for wholeness through symbolic representation. AI, however, lacks this constitutive void. It neither desires nor suffers, and thus, while it can generate art, it cannot create in the psychoanalytic sense. Its productions are simulations, however intricate, lacking the libidinal investment that renders human art a confrontation with the Real. This is where the existential crisis of AI-generated art unfolds. If art is to be defined as the manifestation of inner turmoil, existential questioning, and the ineffable yearnings of being, then AI's role in the arts becomes a simulacrum of true creativity—an echo without an original voice. The aesthetic singularity AI promises thus threatens to render the concept of authorship meaningless. If machines can create without agency, then authorship itself becomes an illusion, dissolved into the collective unconscious of the algorithm. The Commodification of Creativity: From Catharsis to Consumption AI does not merely alter how art is created but also how it is consumed. Late capitalism thrives on efficiency and productivity, and AI fits seamlessly into this framework. Algorithmic art does not need rest, inspiration, or existential crisis; it operates on demand, tailored to market preferences. The distinction between high art and mass production collapses under the weight of infinite customization. AI-generated literature and paintings become products in the purest sense, stripped of the inefficiencies of the human creative struggle. Walter Benjamin's critique of mechanical reproduction warned of the loss of the 'aura'—the unique presence of an artwork in time and space. AI extends this logic to its extreme. When a painting can be replicated or generated infinitely, when a poem can be adjusted in real-time based on audience reception, what remains of the sacred aura of artistic expression? Furthermore, the psychoanalytic function of art as catharsis is undermined. Traditional artistic labor involves confrontation with the unconscious, a journey through repression and revelation. AI-generated works, devoid of psychic investment, risk becoming mere commodities—slick, polished, and ultimately hollow. The therapeutic potential of literature and the arts is diluted when the process of artistic struggle is replaced by instant generativity. The Promise of Transhumanist Art: A Hybrid Future? Despite its threats, AI also presents new forms of artistic experience that may redefine human creativity rather than destroy it. Transhumanist philosophers envision a future where human cognition is augmented by artificial intelligence, leading to an entirely new category of artistic expression. In this vision, AI does not replace human creativity but enhances it—offering artists novel tools to navigate the liminal spaces of imagination. AI-generated art, rather than an autonomous force, may function as a prosthetic extension of the artist's mind. Just as the invention of photography transformed visual representation without eradicating painting, AI might serve as a new mode of aesthetic evolution. The human-AI collaboration could birth forms of literature and art that are unimaginable within the constraints of the human cognitive apparatus alone. However, this hybrid future demands vigilance. The risk remains that AI's ability to predict and optimize artistic trends might result in a hyper-rationalization of creativity. If algorithms dictate aesthetic decisions based on engagement metrics and popularity, art may increasingly serve as a means of control rather than a vehicle for radical expression. Conclusion: The End or Evolution of Art? AI's intrusion into literature and the arts is not merely a technological shift but a philosophical and psychoanalytic rupture. It raises the fundamental question of whether creativity is a uniquely human trait or if it can be outsourced to an intelligence devoid of human consciousness. AI's potential to expand artistic possibilities is undeniable, but so is its capacity to trivialize and commodify creativity. From a psychoanalytic perspective, AI lacks the unconscious depths that fuel human artistic production. Its outputs, however refined, remain spectral—approximations of creativity rather than its true expression. Philosophically, AI challenges the concept of authorship, placing artistic agency in a liminal state between human intention and machine execution. Perhaps, then, the real challenge is not whether AI can create art but whether humans will allow themselves to be eclipsed by their own creations. If AI is to be integrated into the arts, it must not be as a mere producer of aesthetic commodities but as a means to deepen the human encounter with the unknown. The fate of literature and the arts in the age of AI will ultimately depend on whether we harness artificial intelligence to elevate human creativity or surrender to the seductive ease of mechanized imagination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufrCcQg_Pp1zJ	2025-03-06T17:06:59-08:00	
EU Edges Closer To €150 Billion Defense Package Despite Hungary’s...	By Alexandra Brzozowski and Magnus Lund Nielsen and Nicoletta Ionta and Owen Morgan and Thomas Moller-Nielsen (EurActiv) -- EU leaders endorsed a landmark €150 billion defence spending plan at their highly-anticipated emergency summit on Thursday, while Hungary's Viktor Orbán refused to back a statement of support for Ukraine. All 27 EU countries agreed to consider 'as a matter of urgency' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's plan to issue €150 billion in fresh loans to boost defence spending, paving the way for the Commission to put a concrete proposal on the table by the next summit in two weeks' time. However, a statement of support for Ukraine was supported by only 26 countries, with Orbán – an ally of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin – remaining in obdurate opposition, as most leaders had anticipated. It is not the first time in recent history that EU leaders have adopted a separate statement without Hungarian backing. But their doing so on Thursday shows clear intent that a 'coalition of the willing' will find avenues to send more financial and military aid to Ukraine as the United States withdraws. Hungary could not agree to the statement that all other EU leaders 'firmly supported', which affirmed that 'there can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine' and that any peace deal must 'respect Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Slovakia, led by the pro-Russian Robert Fico, was persuaded to support the Ukraine text by the last-minute inclusion of wording on exploring 'workable solutions' to its ongoing gas supply dispute with Kyiv – though the concession was significantly watered down in the summit's final hours. 'Money where our mouth is' Von der Leyen, who took leaders through the contours of her ReArm Europe plan first announced on Tuesday, confirmed she would table a legal text that elaborates on her menu of five defence funding options in time for the next summit. Those five options, which attracted varying support on Thursday, include: the €150 billion in loans, activating a national 'escape clause' in the bloc's fiscal rules, incentivising the use of cohesion funding for defence spending, a bigger role for the European Investment Bank, and mobilising private capital through completing the Savings and Investment Union. Not on the table, yet, is joint borrowing – or the issuance of so-called Eurobonds – despite French President Emmanuel Macron saying after the summit he was 'ready to look' at the idea. Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz confirmed that Germany would like the spending plans to go even further, by creating a long-term exemption of defence investment from EU fiscal rules. European Council President António Costa, who convened the emergency summit, called for 'flexibility' in the application of the fiscal rules, but stopped short of backing the German proposal for a full revamp. 'We are putting our money where our mouth is,' Costa said. Hungary's 'isolation' is not 'division' On Ukraine, meanwhile, the 26 European leaders agreed to examine proposals by the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas for a significanly increased aid package to be sent to Ukraine this year – which had fallen off the draft text only days prior. Macron said that the EU is 'entering a phase of discussions' that means he will soon be 'ready to talk to President Putin... once we've agreed with both President Zelenskyy and our partners that the time is right.' Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – who secured a minor victory with the late inclusion of language that 'welcomes all efforts' towards a 'comprehensive, just and lasting' peace, including those of Trump – ruled out deploying Italian troops to Ukraine in a peacekeeping force. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who joined the leaders for a working lunch, lauded a 'very productive day' in Brussels and confirmed he would travel to Saudi Arabia next week, where his team would attend talks with the United States. 'We are not alone - and we feel it,' he had told reporters on his arrival earlier on Thursday. Despite Hungary's opposition, there was general insistence that the EU's message of support for Kyiv was not weakened. Hungary had 'isolated itself', said Costa – which does not mean 'division'. 'Anytime you bring 27 countries around the table, everybody has their own nuance,' Thomas Byrne, Ireland's European minister, told reporters. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged her fellow leaders to 'conclude that it is really good that there are 26 countries in the EU that – with everything that is happening around us and with the challenges in Ukraine – stand firm in our support.' 'We can be proud of the old continent today,' she added.

Macron’s Offer: France And The Delusions Of Nuclear Deterrence – ...	The singular antics of US President Donald Trump, notably towards supposed allies, has stirred the pot regarding national security in various capitals. From Canberra to Brussels, there is concern that such assumed, if unverifiable notions as extended nuclear deterrence from Washington are valid anymore. America First interests certainly bring that into question, as well it should. If the imperium is in self-introspective retreat, this is to the good. But the internationalists beg to differ, wishing to see the United States as imperial guarantor. In Europe, the fear at the retreat of Washington’s nuclear umbrella, and the inflation of the Russian threat, has caused flutters of panic. On February 20, 2025, Friedrich Merz, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union and the incoming German chancellor, floated the idea that other states consider shouldering Europe’s security burden. 'We need to have discussions with both the British and the French – the two European nuclear powers – about whether nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security from the UK and France, would apply to us.' Merz has also explicitly urged European states to accept the proposition that 'Donald Trump will no longer unconditionally honour NATO’s mutual defence commitment', making it incumbent on them to 'make every effort to at least be able to defend the European continent on its own.' On March 1, French President Emmanuel Macron showed signs of interest. In an interview with Portuguese TV RTP, he expressed willingness to 'to open this discussion … if it allows to build a European force.' There had 'always been a European dimension to France’s vital interests within its nuclear doctrine.' On March 5, in an address to the nation, Macron openly identified Russia as a 'threat to France and Europe'. Accordingly, he had decided 'to open the strategic debate on the protection of our allies on the European continent by our (nuclear) deterrent.' The future of Europe did not 'have to be decided in Washington or Moscow.' The matter of France’s European dimension has certainly been confirmed by remarks made by previous presidents, including Charles de Gaulle, who, in 1964, stated that an attack on a country such as Germany by the then Soviet Union would be seen as a threat to France. Domestically, Macron’s offer did not go down well in certain quarters. It certainly did not impress Marie Le Pen of the far-right National Rally. 'The French nuclear deterrent must remain a French nuclear deterrent,' she declared in comments made on a visit to the Farm Show in Paris. 'It must not be shared, let alone delegated.' This was a misunderstanding, came the response from Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu. The deterrent 'is French and will remain French – from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.' A number of countries meeting at the European Union emergency security summit in Brussels showed interest in Macron’s offer, with some caution. Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk suggested that 'we must seriously consider this proposal.' Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nausėda thought the idea 'very interesting' as 'a nuclear umbrella would serve as really very serious deterrence towards Russia.' Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa was not inclined to commit to a stationing of French nuclear weapons on Latvian territory: it was 'too soon' to raise the issue. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, on the other hand, found the debate 'premature', as 'our security is guaranteed by close cooperation with the United States'. He certainly has a point, given that the United States still, at present, maintains an extensive nuclear arsenal on European soil. The trouble with deterrence chatter is that it remains hostage to delusion. Strategists talk in extravagant terms about the genuine prospect that nuclear weapons can make any one state safer, leading to some calculus of tolerable use. Thus we find the following comment from Benoît Grémare of the Université Jean Moulin Lyon 3: '[T]he fact remains that without US support, the balance of power appears largely unfavourable to France, which has a total of 290 nuclear warheads compared to at least 1,600 deployed warheads and nearly 2,800 stockpiled warheads on the Russian side.' While Grémare acknowledges that France’s thermonuclear arsenal, along with the M51 strategic sea-to-land ballistic missile, would be able to eliminate major Russian cities, Russia would only need a mere '200 seconds too atomise Paris' if its Satan II thermonuclear weapons were used. 'This potential for reciprocity must be kept in mind amid the mutual bet of nuclear deterrence.' Logic here gives way to the presumption that such weapons, rather than suggesting impotence, promise formidable utility. This theoretical, and absurd proposition, renders the unthinkable possible: that Russia just might use nuclear weapons against European countries. Any such contention must fail for the fundamental point that nuclear weapons should, quite simply, never be used. Instead, they should be disbanded and banned altogether, in line with the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Unfortunately, the French offer of replacing the US nuclear umbrella in Europe perpetrates similar deadly sins about deterrence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufpoDu3lKMwSE	2025-03-06T16:57:05-08:00	
Cambodia: World’s ‘Largest Online Black Market’ Loses Banking Lic...	By Jack Adamović Davies Huione Pay, the banking arm of what’s been called the world’s 'largest ever illicit online marketplace,' has been stripped of its banking license, the National Bank of Cambodia confirmed to RFA this week. The company is part of the wider Huione Group of Cambodia, a conglomerate which operates several 'Huione' products, including marketplaces, banking and finance apps. One of these, a Telegram marketplace, has been identified as a notorious place for crime tied to up to $24 billion in illicit transactions. Huione Pay’s license was withdrawn owing to its noncompliance with 'existing regulations and recommendations that may have been made by the regulators,' a National Bank of Cambodia spokesperson told RFA by email on Thursday. The spokesperson did not say when the license was withdrawn or what repercussions the company might face if they continue to operate. Huione did not respond to RFA’s requests for comment before publication. It has previously denied criminal activity– when Huione was identified by the cryptocurrency compliance firm Elliptic to have facilitated millions of dollars in criminal payments, it issued a statement insisting that it was a mere 'information publishing and guarantee trading platform' bearing no responsibility for the goods and services others used it to trade. However, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, or UNODC, Huione’s Telegram marketplace has become one of the main arteries of illicit commerce in Southeast Asia, a region grappling with an epidemic of human trafficking and internet fraud. The UNODC’s regional representative, Benedikt Hofmann, welcomed the termination of Huione Pay’s license. The withdrawal 'will send an important signal, especially given the high profile of Huione and its outsize role for the region’s criminal ecosystem,' he told RFA. Hofmann cautioned, however, that this latest development would not be a cure-all for the region’s crime epidemic – nor would it necessarily mean the end of Huione. 'Huione is in many ways the tip of the iceberg and we will see users shifting to other, similar providers which have emerged in the region,' he added. Much of the money that was being moved through Huione Pay came from illicit activities linked to cyberscamming, the UNODC found. For more than half a decade the region in which Huione operates has been dotted with compounds housing what the U.N. says are hundreds of thousands of enslaved workers forced to perpetrate a type of cyberscam commonly known as 'pig butchering'. The practice is estimated to swindle billions of dollars from its victims around the world every year. Elliptic, the cryptocurrency compliance firm, traced billions of dollars flowing from Huione Guarantee, the Telegram marketplace, to Huione Pay. This was 'likely so that these criminally-derived funds could be cashed out,' firm founder Tom Robinson told RFA. 'I think this will be a blow to Huione Guarantee,' Robinson added. 'We have direct evidence of Huione Pay laundering money from scam victims around the world, including the elderly and vulnerable. They are willing facilitators of pig butchering and other fraud, so any regulatory action against them should be welcomed.' The loss of Huione Pay’s license, which has not been previously reported, does not seem to have curtailed the company’s activities, however. As recently as Thursday the company’s official Telegram channel, linked to on its website, was offering loans to customers. A post on February 27th promoted the launch of a Huione-branded Visa card. Visa did not respond to requests for comment by press time. News of Huione Pay’s license being withdrawn was greeted as overdue by a former employee who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. They told RFA it was openly acknowledged within the company that there were two sets of accounts maintained. 'They cook the books,' the former employee said. While the company handled billions of dollars, 'close to none' of those transactions were made available to the compliance department, which was relegated to the role of advisors, ' whose advice were never taken seriously,' the former employee said. One of Huione Pay’s three directors is Hun To, a cousin of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet. Official censure of a company so close to the inner circle of Cambodia’s ruling family is unusual. But Jacob Sims, an expert on transnational crime, told RFA that the withdrawal of Huione’s banking license should not be read as a herald of reform. 'It all ultimately amounts to a brand switch,' Sims said. 'It’s basically an easy thing for the regime to point to and say, ‘Look, we’re cracking down on this’ without doing really anything but consolidating Huione’s available brands.' For Sims, there’s one way the Cambodian government could show it was serious about cracking down on the crime wave Huione has been surfing: 'Arrest all the people involved in Huione.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufv6XzDSqmF9W	2025-03-06T16:53:45-08:00	
US Envoy To Travel To Saudi Arabia For Talks With Ukrainians	A top Trump administration official said Thursday he would travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with Ukrainian representatives for talks about a ceasefire to pause Russia’s invasion. 'We’re now in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians in Riyadh, or even potentially Jeddah,' said Steve Witkoff, who serves as U.S. President Donald Trump’s special Middle East envoy. He added: 'The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well.' He said Trump felt Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made amends after the two leaders’ confrontation in the White House last Friday. 'He felt that Zelenskyy’s letter was a very positive first step. There was an apology. There was an acknowledgement that the United States has done so much for the country of Ukraine, and a sense of gratitude,' Witkoff said. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, was in Brussels with European leaders for emergency talks. 'We will arm ourselves faster, smarter and more efficiently than Russia,' said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who holds the European Union's rotating presidency. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen advanced a plan to loosen budget rules so countries that are willing can spend much more on defense, alongside commitments to encourage the 27 member countries to invest a total of about $863 billion in defense over the next four years. 'We are very thankful that we are not alone and these are not just words,' Zelenskyy said. 'We feel it. It’s very important.' French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of talks that EU members would 'take decisive steps forward,' while he expressed concerns about shifts in U.S. support for Ukraine under Trump. 'The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,' Macron said. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said Thursday that France is sharing intelligence with Ukraine, a move that followed the United States saying it was cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that the United States had, for the moment, ended sharing its intelligence with Kyiv, although the move could be short-lived after Zelenskyy said the exchanges with Trump in the Oval Office last week had been 'regrettable' and that Ukraine was ready for peace talks with Russia. Trump earlier in the week ordered the U.S. to suspend military aid to Kyiv’s fighters. Since the start of the war in 2022, the United States has provided Ukraine with significant intelligence, including critical information its military needs for targeting Russian forces. Reaching a peace deal could prove difficult. Ukraine has long demanded a restoration of its internationally recognized 2014 borders before Moscow unilaterally seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Overall, Russia now holds about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including much of eastern Ukraine, and has vowed to not return any of it to the Kyiv government.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufl4NbGCTJmfg	2025-03-06T16:50:46-08:00	
Trump Bullish But America Divided – OpEd	By Dr. Amal Mudallali President Donald Trump declared on Tuesday that 'America is back' at the start of his first speech to a joint session of Congress in his second term. He proclaimed: 'America’s momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back,' before adding that the American dream is 'unstoppable.' But a look at the headlines of the last few days shows a different America and a different world than the one the president boasted about. The country is split down the middle about his policies and that was visually obvious during the speech to Congress. The Department of Government Efficiency and its leader Elon Musk are under attack by Democrats and government employees who have lost their jobs. The opposition, Congress and the courts are battling the president in what some have dubbed a constitutional crisis over the president’s authority. The relationship between the US and its neighbors is tense due to the president’s tariffs against Canada and Mexico, while China is threatening a trade war. There are fears over the long-term damage being to America’s relations with its neighbors and to global trade. The relationship with America’s allies in Europe, America’s closest allies and NATO partners, is rife with tension over the war in Ukraine, how best to end it and how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In his speech, the president presented a different picture on all these issues and events on the ground show that his strategy is winning so far. The president invited Musk to his congressional speech and praised him for the accomplishments of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with overhauling the federal government. Musk and his team have been making drastic cuts to federal agencies, leading to job cuts, the elimination of agencies like the US Agency for International Development and funding freezes, fueling protests and an outcry by Democrats. Several of the federal employees who have lost their jobs were in the gallery as guests of the Democrats. The president said Musk is 'working very hard. He didn’t need this' and was not apologetic about the work of the department. While the president boasted about his success in securing the border, his tariff battle with America’s neighbors is capturing the headlines. The tariffs have caused a crisis in America’s relationship with Canada and Mexico and are threatening to upend global trade, while affecting the livelihoods of everyday Americans. Experts are warning that the tariffs could lead to greater inflation and affect the president’s domestic and economic agendas, while causing recessions in Canada and Mexico. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the crisis with the two neighbors may be resolved this week and Trump will 'probably' announce a deal that will reduce the tariffs, following lengthy phone calls between their representatives and the commerce secretary. The dispute between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his European allies also seems on its way to being resolved. The president softened his tone after he received an 'important letter' and expression of regret by Zelensky over the Oval Office argument with the American president and Vice President J.D. Vance. The letter expressed Ukraine’s willingness to come 'to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,' President Trump said as he read from it. Trump also quoted the Ukrainian president assuring him that he was ready to sign the 'agreement on minerals and security.' The US president did not back down from his intention to 'reclaim' the Panama Canal or shy away from a new expansionist foreign policy. As proof that Trump’s strategy seems to be working, it emerged that a consortium of companies including American investment firm BlackRock was set to buy shares from the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings that would give it control of the ports at either end of the canal. This would give Trump, who raised the alarm about potential Chinese interference with shipping operations in the strategic canal, a victory. Greenland is also still in the sights of the American president. After telling Greenland, 'we strongly support your right to determine your own future,' he said: 'One way or the other, we’re going to get it,' citing its vitality to American and international security. But the response from Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede was categoric. 'We are not for sale and cannot be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,' he wrote after the speech. Trump did not say much about the Middle East, except to speak of the Abraham Accords that were agreed in his first term, which he described as 'one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations.' He said a 'lot of things are happening in the Middle East … a rough neighborhood, actually.' But his administration seems to have already rejected the plan for rebuilding Gaza that was approved by the Arab summit in Cairo this week. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told The Times of Israel that Trump 'stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas.' He added that the Arab plan 'does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.' But he kept the door open for more talks 'to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' Does Trump’s agenda have the backing of the American people, whether domestically or on foreign policy? He spoke to a divided country. The Congress chamber looked like a split screen, with Republicans standing up and cheering and Democrats sitting down and protesting with signs like 'it’s a lie,' 'resist' and 'Musk steals.' But the Democrats seemed more like students protesting in the streets than a political party that has a strategy or a roadmap on how to oppose Trump’s agenda. The president said more Americans now believe that the country is going in the right direction. At least one poll supported this statement, with 47 percent of Americans believing this, up 10 points from December, as Newsweek reported. The Democrats are not seen as a credible opposition with a strategy, while the president is on a winning streak and he is 'just getting started,' as he said in his speech.

Pakistan’s Eroding Strategic Flexibility: The Heavy Price Of Its ...	Pakistan stands at a decisive juncture in its history. Once recognised as a regional power with immense potential, the nation now grapples with a troubling decline in strategic flexibility. This is largely attributed to short-sighted policies that have prioritised military strength over other national priorities. The consequences of these decisions are increasingly apparent, jeopardising Pakistan's political cohesion and economic development. A unified, resilient political landscape is essential for enhancing Pakistan's strategic flexibility. However, the military's outsized influence over civilian governance has fragmented the political system, hindering the establishment of robust democratic institutions. Political parties struggle to formulate stable, long-term strategies amidst this environment. In recent years, Pakistan has faced numerous political crises, many escalating into violent confrontations, widespread protests, and growing distrust between the state and its citizens. While some political tension is inevitable in any democracy, Pakistan's habitual reliance on coercive measures to resolve disputes has perpetuated a damaging cycle. Historically, the state has employed force - through military interventions, police actions, and other coercive means - to manage political crises. Such actions frequently exacerbate the very issues they aim to resolve, leading to heightened polarisation, public unrest, and enduring instability. Although force may provide temporary suppression of dissent or a veneer of order, it fails to address the root causes of political conflict and often widens the divide between the government and the people. Pakistan finds itself trapped in a damaging cycle, political repression stifles progress and fuels instability, undermining economic recovery. The military's overwhelming influence over civilian leadership has created an environment that frequently suppresses dissent, restricting the free exchange of ideas and stifling democratic growth. This political repression, ostensibly aimed at preserving control, has ultimately resulted in greater harm by cultivating instability that obstructs Pakistan's development across multiple fronts. This predicament generates a paradox - while Pakistan projects military strength globally, its internal cohesion remains fragile. Ongoing military interference has prevented civilian leaders from adequately addressing critical internal challenges like poverty, corruption, and unemployment, all of which are essential for national stability. Consequently, these unresolved issues undermine Pakistan's ability to formulate flexible, pragmatic policies that can adapt to evolving global dynamics. The consequences of political repression extend far beyond the economic sphere, profoundly impacting the daily lives of average Pakistanis in ways often overlooked by those in power. Economic hardships like rising unemployment and inflation disproportionately burden the poor and marginalised, who must endure a political system that fails to prioritise their welfare. The lack of political cohesion and accountability contributes to the neglect or underfunding of vital public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. This perpetuates a cycle of inequality where the struggling become increasingly disenfranchised, depriving future generations of opportunities for upward mobility. The prospects of the Pakistani populace are, in many ways, compromised by a ruling elite that prioritises control over genuine progress. To break free from Pakistan's detrimental political cycle, the country must undertake comprehensive reforms that prioritise democratic values, political inclusivity, and expanded freedoms. The political landscape requires decentralisation, allowing for the inclusion of a wider array of voices and ideologies. Such an approach would not only enhance political cohesion but also promote national unity. This transformative process should begin by empowering civilian institutions and ensuring the military's role remains strictly within constitutional boundaries, enabling elected leaders to guide the nation's future. Political reform would further contribute to increased transparency and accountability - critical components for restoring public trust in the system. Without a strong political framework that holds leaders accountable, Pakistan's future trajectory will remain uncertain. For citizens to actively engage in the political system's development, they must have faith in its integrity. The time has come for Pakistan to move away from relying on coercive measures as the primary response to challenges. By cultivating a culture of dialogue and negotiation, the country can lay the groundwork for a more inclusive, peaceful, and stable future. This does not imply abandoning the state's obligation to maintain law and order, but rather a reconsideration of conflict resolution strategies, favoring peaceful solutions over violent or coercive actions. Both the state and citizens have essential roles to play in supporting this new social contract emphasising dialogue and peaceful conflict resolution. Pakistan possesses the capability to reclaim its strategic flexibility and influence, but it must first recognise that genuine security and sustainable growth stem from comprehensive solutions, not solely military strength. By reevaluating its policies and developing a more integrated national strategy, Pakistan can forge a path toward a future characterised by resilience, cooperation, and innovation in addressing both internal and external challenges. The urgency for action is paramount. This article was published at The Friday Times	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufp8pADN3HjuL	2025-03-06T16:40:37-08:00	
UN Experts Condemn Israeli Move To Reopen ‘Gates Of Hell’ And Uni...	By Ephrem Kossaify More than 20 UN independent human rights experts have denounced the decision by the Israeli government to block all humanitarian aid to Gaza and resume a total siege of the territory. They warned that this breaks the terms of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, breaks international law and puts the prospects for peace in jeopardy. In a joint statement on Thursday, the experts condemned Israel’s decision on Sunday to suspend deliveries of all goods to Gaza, including critical, life-saving aid. It follows an announcement by the Israeli war Cabinet that it was prepared to withdraw from the ceasefire agreement, with some ministers openly calling for reopening the 'gates of hell' in the war-battered enclave. 'This action constitutes a gross violation of international law,' the experts said. 'As an occupying power, Israel is legally obligated to ensure the provision of sufficient food, medical supplies, and other forms of aid. 'By blocking such essential services, including those vital to sexual and reproductive health and disability support, Israel is weaponizing humanitarian assistance.' Such actions represent 'serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law,' they added, and might amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute. The independent experts who put their names to the statement included Francesca Albanese, the special rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Michael Fakhri, the special rapporteur on the right to food. Special rapporteurs are part of what is known as the special procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. They are independent experts who work on a voluntary basis, are not members of UN staff and are not paid for their work. They also criticized Israel’s general approach to the ceasefire agreement, which initially was hailed as a pathway to peace. Instead of fostering a cessation of hostilities, however, the agreement has been marked by continued violence and destruction. At least 100 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since it took effect on Jan. 19. The total death toll in the territory since the war began in October 2023 now stands at 48,400, as Israeli forces persist with airstrikes and ground assaults. 'The harsh conditions of the ceasefire, marked by limited aid and scarce resources, have only exacerbated the suffering of Gaza’s population,' the experts wrote. 'The decision to reimpose a total siege on Gaza — where 80 percent of farmland and civilian infrastructure has already been destroyed — will undoubtedly worsen the humanitarian crisis.' While some states and regional organizations have attempted to justify Israel’s actions as a response to alleged ceasefire violations by Hamas, the experts noted that repeated violations of the agreement by Israel have largely gone unreported. They called for the mediators of the ceasefire deal, Egypt, Qatar and the US, to intervene to help preserve the agreement in accordance with international obligations. They also stressed that Israel’s actions should be viewed within the context of the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, a situation the International Court of Justice has demanded came an end. The experts concluded by issuing a strong call for global action: 'Nations must recall their obligations under international law and act to halt this brutal assault on the Palestinian people. The international community cannot allow lawlessness and injustice to prevail.' As the world watches the devastating effects of the latest Israeli decision, the experts warned that fragile hopes for peace in the region continue to fade, and the humanitarian disaster in Gaza is far from over. The initial phase of the ceasefire expired on Sunday without Israel and Hamas reaching an agreement on an extension or a way forward for the deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufpPXNBU0l5ht	2025-03-06T16:33:16-08:00	
The Fractured Shield: Can Europe Secure Itself If America Walks A...	The battlefields of Ukraine are not just testing Kyiv’s resilience; they are exposing the fragility of the Western security order. For decades, Europe has outsourced its defense to American power, relying on Washington’s nuclear umbrella, intelligence networks, and military supremacy. But what happens when that umbrella folds? A Future Without Washington’s Security Guarantee In Washington, where political tides shift with electoral cycles, murmurs of disengagement are growing louder. A second Trump presidency could usher in an era of isolationism that European leaders have long feared. Proposals to withdraw from the United Nations, freeze military aid to Ukraine, or even exit NATO are no longer speculative—each has been openly debated in America’s political mainstream. The implications are stark. If the United States retracts its security commitments, can Europe hold the line against an emboldened Russia? Can NATO survive as a European-led entity? And most urgently, should Ukraine brace for a Western-brokered 'peace' that cements Russian territorial gains while locking Kyiv into economic dependence on its allies? The Numbers Don’t Lie: Can Europe Defend Ukraine Alone? The cold calculus of war tells a sobering story. The United States has delivered over '$75 billion' in military assistance to Ukraine since 2022—more than double what all European nations combined have provided. The Pentagon alone has supplied 'over 2,000 armoured vehicles, 300,000 rounds of artillery, and advanced missile systems' that have kept Ukrainian defences operational. By contrast, Europe, despite its vocal solidarity, has struggled to match America’s firepower. The European Union’s much-vaunted '€50 billion aid package' pales in comparison to Washington’s largesse. Germany’s pledge to boost its military spending to '2% of GDP' remains unfulfilled, and even France—long an advocate for European 'strategic autonomy'—lacks the industrial capacity to replace American weapons in the short term. The UK, despite being one of Ukraine’s staunchest backers, faces significant constraints in its defense production capabilities. The question is not whether Europe wants to support Ukraine—it is whether it 'can'. And right now, the numbers suggest it 'cannot'. The Fragile Chessboard: A War or a Truce on America’s Terms? The military aid dilemma is just one part of a broader geopolitical shift. Behind closed doors, the Biden administration is already exploring the contours of a potential peace deal—one that may not align with Ukraine’s ambitions. At the heart of the negotiations is an unspoken trade-off: Ukraine’s war effort is bleeding Western arms stockpiles dry, but Kyiv also possesses a wealth of 'rare earth minerals' critical to American and European industries. Ukraine holds some of the largest untapped reserves of 'lithium, titanium, and nickel'—all essential for military hardware and clean energy technology. A potential deal would see Kyiv securing long-term American economic support in exchange for prioritizing U.S. and European access to these critical resources. But at what cost? A settlement could pressure Ukraine into territorial concessions, effectively rewarding Russia’s aggression while transforming Ukraine into a resource colony for the West. If Ukraine refuses, the alternative is equally stark: fighting a war without the assurance of continuous Western aid. Can NATO Survive an American Exit? The biggest strategic question looming over Europe is whether NATO can endure without U.S. leadership. Washington currently accounts for nearly '70% of NATO’s defense spending', and its military bases in Germany, Poland, and the Baltics serve as deterrents against Russian expansionism. If an American withdrawal from NATO materializes, European nations will need to rapidly build a credible defense infrastructure—a task that will require at least '€500 billion in immediate military investments' just to replace U.S. capabilities. European unity, however, is fragile. 'Macron’s vision of an independent European defense force' clashes with Poland’s insistence on a 'U.S.-centric security structure'. The cracks within the EU’s security apparatus could widen under the pressure of war. Meanwhile, the UK's post-Brexit security strategy remains in flux. While London has remained a reliable partner to Kyiv, its long-term commitment to European defense in the absence of American leadership remains uncertain. Can the UK, alongside France and Germany, lead a reconfigured NATO without Washington’s firepower? For Ukraine, this means one thing: 'Time is running out'. The New World Order: A Future Without Washington’s Hegemony If America disengages, the ramifications extend far beyond Europe. A retreat from Ukraine would embolden China to accelerate its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific, raising the likelihood of a 'Taiwan confrontation'. Meanwhile, Moscow, sensing Western vulnerability, could set its sights on 'Moldova or the Baltics'—testing NATO’s willingness to defend its smallest members. A weakened NATO could also shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where 'Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia' are vying for regional dominance. Without American leadership, Europe would struggle to navigate the diplomatic fallout from a reconfigured global order in which 'Beijing and Moscow dictate the terms of engagement'. In an increasingly multipolar world, European leaders must ask themselves: Is it time to break free from America’s security apparatus and chart an 'independent defense strategy'? Or will the West’s failure to secure Ukraine mark the 'unravelling of the post-World War II order'? The Economic Fallout: What a Disengaged America Means for Markets Beyond security concerns, the economic ramifications of a U.S. pullback from global leadership would be profound. A fractured transatlantic alliance would 'undermine investor confidence', drive 'capital flight from European markets', and create supply chain disruptions—particularly in the energy and defense sectors. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England would need to 'reassess financial stability measures' in anticipation of geopolitical turbulence. Meanwhile, China and Russia could use the opportunity to expand their influence over 'emerging markets, energy networks, and digital infrastructure', further challenging Western economic supremacy. A U.S. retreat from NATO would also raise questions about the future of the 'petrodollar system', as Gulf states reconsider their reliance on American security guarantees. If Saudi Arabia and the UAE shift towards a 'multipolar trade strategy', it could significantly impact global commodity markets, driving 'higher inflation and currency volatility'. The Defining Crossroads The war in Ukraine has transcended the realm of a single nation's struggle for sovereignty; it has become a litmus test for the resilience of the transatlantic alliance—an order painstakingly constructed from the wreckage of the last great conflict. The fractures of the present war now threaten to unmake the very foundations of Western security. Should Washington waver in its commitments, Europe must brace for the fallout. The question is not merely one of willingness, but of capability. Is the continent prepared to shoulder the burden of its own defense in the face of an emboldened Russia? The answer remains deeply uncertain. A fundamental truth looms large: Europe’s security is inextricably tied to Ukraine’s fate. And Ukraine’s survival hinges on America’s resolve. The decision, however, is not Europe’s to make. It rests in Washington’s hands. **And the world waits, watching.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufmJsIeHWW_qR	2025-03-06T16:30:12-08:00	
Supreme Court Case For First Catholic Charter School Begins Oral ...	By Kate Quiñones A Catholic charter school is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to approve the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school in a case that could reshape school choice and religious freedom in the U.S. In an opening brief filed on Wednesday, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School — a Catholic charter school managed by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa and Eastern Oklahoma — maintained that it is religious discrimination for the state to withhold generally available funding solely because the school is religious. The Oklahoma Supreme Court previously ordered Oklahoma’s charter school board to rescind the contract with St. Isidore in June, citing the First Amendment’s prohibition of laws that would establish a state religion. Shortly after, both St. Isidore and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board filed separate petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court in October 2024. In the opening briefs, St. Isidore and the school board maintained that if the state is going to offer general funding for private charter organizations, it cannot deny that funding to a charter school on the basis of religion. 'The First Amendment protects St. Isidore from discriminatory state laws that would bar it from participating in that program or receiving funding solely because the school it has designed is religious,' read the brief filed by the Notre Dame Law School’s Lindsay and Matt Moroun Religious Liberty Clinic, a teaching law practice that trains Notre Dame law students. The attorneys pointed out that Oklahoma designed the program 'to foster educational diversity through privately designed and operated charter schools … but Oklahoma denies that opportunity to religious entities solely because they are religious.' In a similar vein, the charter school board argued on Wednesday that the Oklahoma Supreme Court decision was a 'distortion of the First Amendment' that 'would have devastating effects on religious organizations,' according to the opening brief filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit that defends First Amendment rights. 'Faith-based groups often provide vital public services in which they partner with the government or are subject to government regulation,' the brief read. 'Yet under the decision below, many of these organizations would be deemed state actors disqualified from providing broad-ranging social services — including foster care, adoption services, medical care, homeless shelters, and other aid to disadvantaged communities.' Isidore was initially approved to be a charter school by the state board in 2023, but Oklahoma’s Republican Attorney General Gentner Drummond filed a lawsuit against the board, arguing the establishment violated the state’s religious liberty protections. Drummond opposed the charter school’s petitions to the Supreme Court last year, maintaining that having a Catholic charter school is a 'clear-cut First Amendment violation,' according to a Dec. 9 press release. Nicole Stelle Garnett, John P. Murphy Foundation professor of law at Notre Dame, said St. Isidore is asking the Supreme Court to uphold its 'basic right against religious discrimination.' 'States routinely partner with faith-based organizations to serve the public — whether by providing education, shelter, food, health care, you name it,' Garnett said. 'The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the government may not offer support to private groups like these and then deny that opportunity to organizations based on their religion.' Oklahoma ranked 49th in education in the U.S. in 2024, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, with 84% of its eighth graders testing 'not proficient' in math and 76% of its fourth graders 'not proficient' in reading. Michael Scaperlanda, chancellor of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and chairman of St. Isidore's Board, noted that the archdiocese wanted to improve educational access for Oklahomans. 'Too many children in Oklahoma — particularly in remote and rural communities — don’t have robust learning opportunities or access to schools that may serve their children’s individual needs,' Scaperlanda said in a March 6 statement. 'We want to help fill that gap by offering an excellent, Catholic education to all interested families across the state, regardless of their zip code, their income, or any other circumstance.' 'All children deserve to thrive in an environment that fits them, and we hope to help make that a reality,' Scaperlanda added. There are more than 30 privately operated charter schools in Oklahoma. John Meiser, director of Notre Dame Law School’s Religious Liberty Clinic, lauded Oklahoma’s endeavor to 'foster educational pluralism' and 'create a diversity of learning options for all children' but noted that this must be open to all. 'That is a great endeavor. But bedrock constitutional law is clear: Oklahoma cannot invite any and all educators to participate in it except those who happen to be religious,' Meiser said. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on April 30, with a decision expected this summer.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JuftsYplBO5J-7	2025-03-06T16:23:47-08:00	
Thaksin’s Apology For Southern Thai Massacre Could Boost Peace Ta...	By Mariyam Ahmad and Nontarat Phaicharoen Former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra’s recent apology about a 2004 massacre that took place under his watch and his new role as adviser to ASEAN chair Malaysia could potentially influence peace talks in Thailand’s southern border provinces, security analysts said. Peace negotiations between Bangkok and Malay Muslim separatist rebels have shown no signs of resuming in the more than six months since Thaksin’s daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, became Thailand’s prime minister. Meanwhile, the post of chief Thai peace negotiator has been left vacant for months, amid sporadic insurgency-related violence in the Thai Deep South. Thaksin, who returned to Thailand in August 2023 after years of self-imposed exile and later received a royal pardon, visited the southern border region on Feb. 23 as the new adviser to Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of neighboring Malaysia, the 2025 chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. During his visit Thaksin apologized for incidents that occurred under his administration. He was responding to a question about the Tak Bai massacre, one of the most infamous incidents in the long-running insurgency. The former prime minister said he had good intentions and cared for everyone before a military coup forced him from office in 2006. 'But mistakes can happen in governance. If I made any mistakes that were unsatisfactory, I apologize so that we can turn back and solve problems together. I don’t want small misunderstandings to remain,' he said, without specifically mentioning the massacre. The incident occurred on Oct. 25, 2004, when security forces violently dispersed protesters from in front of the police station in Tak Bai, a district of Narathiwat province. Eighty-five people were killed. Most of the victims gagged to death in the backs of military trucks, where they were bound and stacked up like logs. The 20-year statute of limitations passed last year without any charges being filed. Phumtham Wechayachai, Thailand’s deputy prime minister and defense minister, praised Thaksin’s visit, calling it a sign that progress should be visible this year. 'I think we will have a better direction and next year we will find a way to end this. As the person responsible for the southern region, we should be able to find a solution,' Phumtham told reporters on Feb. 27. 'I confirm that the dialogue process still exists, but I cannot specify the plans in the immediate future. I would like this Ramadan month to prove that there must be no incidents and violence must stop,' said Phumtham, who serves as deputy prime minister under Prime Minister Paetongtarn. Since MPs elected Paetongtarn as PM to succeed Srettha Thavisin in August 2024, little has been done to foster peace in the border region – which she visited in January – while no formal talks have been held, analysts and activists noted. Among those is Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, director of the Cross Cultural Foundation. 'Even though it’s a democratic government, in practice it doesn’t play a role in controlling security agencies. Doing nothing is like neglecting duty, such as not appointing a head of the peace dialogue panel,' she told BenarNews. 'Meanwhile, the violence has increased significantly. Since the statute of limitations expired for the Tak Bai case, expectations have risen, but when they do nothing, it’s like neglecting an important duty.' Another analyst said Thaksin’s apology was needed. 'Thaksin has previously made statements like this, but this time it could be considered the clearest and most official,' Panitan Wattanayagorn, a security analyst and former chairman of the government’s security advisory committee, told BenarNews. 'Apologizing is better than saying nothing at all, because significant events related to the southern border situation occurred while he was prime minister. Not saying anything might be more damaging,' he said. The year 2004 was the one during which the insurgency reignited. The Deep South, made up of provinces and districts that lie along Thailand’s border with Malaysia, is where members of the predominantly ethnic Malay Muslim population have long pressed for greater autonomy. The Deep South Watch monitoring center reported over 22,000 violent incidents occurred between 2004 and 2024, resulting in over 7,500 deaths and 14,000 injuries. Between 2005 and 2024, the Thai government has spent about 500 billion baht (U.S. $14.7 billion) addressing southern border problems. Peace talks began in 2013 but have frequently stalled because of government changes. Important vacancy unfilled Going forward, the Paetongtarn administration needs to improve the National Security Council (NSC) role in peace talks, Panitan said. Chatchai Bangchuad, had served as lead negotiator in Deep South peace talks with Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) rebel leaders but his promotion to NSC security council chief last October means the lead negotiator position is open. 'The government must urgently enhance the NSC’s capabilities, as they have been inadequate so far. They might begin by adding both domestic and international advisers to formulate a winning strategy,' he said. 'The dialogue can be postponed, but it’s necessary to exchange new information, control the situation in the area and successfully bring people to the table.' Meanwhile, some analysts and human rights advocates said Thaksin’s apology lacked sufficient weight given the severity of past incidents. 'It seemed like he was saying that officers might make mistakes. He may have wanted to be cautious about being blamed for past problems, but he apologized only for minor frictions,' Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of Deep South Watch, told BenarNews. 'In reality, the feelings of people in the area regarding the Krue Se and Tak Bai incidents, where many people died with high levels of violence, at minimum Thaksin should take responsibility for this part and express it with stronger words,' he said. Analysts said Anwar’s appointment of Thaksin could potentially assist Malaysia’s involvement in addressing the southern conflict, particularly given Kuala Lumpur’s role as facilitator of peace talks between the Thai government and BRN. 'The appointment of Thaksin as adviser to the ASEAN chair might help bring Brunei and Indonesia into participating in the peace process,' Panitan, the analyst, said. 'However, cooperation between the government and opposition on this issue should also exist.' In addition, Srisompob said, Thaksin could have some power. 'After this, Thaksin might use his special relationship with Anwar to solve problems through back channels, addressing issues that can’t be resolved through open processes.' Anwar, meanwhile, told Malaysian PMs last week that Thaksin’s appointment could buoy efforts to resolve the conflict in Thailand’s southern border region. 'It helps even though there were some controversies being raised. He recently went to southern Thailand to apologize for the Tak Bai incident and gave assurance that he will cooperate with Malaysia to find peace,' Anwar said. Jon Preechawong in Bangkok and Farhana Farush in Kuala Lumpur contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeI5vp5sYp-nrdgM6TlnK19	2025-03-04T17:08:19-08:00	
Rising Arctic Temperatures Threaten Russian Cities And Military F...	Temperatures in the Russian North are rising three times as fast as in other parts of the country, a development with enormous but as of yet not fully appreciated geoeconomic and geopolitical consequences. These changes are increasing the ability of other countries to transit the Northern Sea Route (NSR) without relying on Russian icebreakers. Critically, rising temperatures are thawing the permafrost underlying the whole region, in turn undermining and destroying the integrity of local infrastructure, including pipelines and airfields. Rising temperatures are also further isolating population centers and military bases, making it far more difficult for Moscow to exploit natural resources and sustain Russian dominance of the NSR and the country’s claims in the Arctic (see EDM, November 15, 2022, February 22, 2023; The Barents Observer, May 18, 2022; To Be Precise, September 22, 2023; TASS; RIA Novosti, September 11, 2024; The Moscow Times, September 12, 2024). While Moscow celebrates what it has achieved—and often even what it has not—the situation in the North is a quickly escalating problem for the Russian government (Window on Eurasia, January 10). Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has forced Moscow to cut back and even cancel plans to build railways and highways in the Russian North (see EDM, February 22, 2023). At present, the region severely lacks sufficient road and rail infrastructure. Communities living in the North have instead traditionally relied on 'ice roads,' which are formed when rivers freeze, for delivery of supplies and to transport ores of various kinds. Ice roads, however, can no longer be relied on because the surface of many waterways is not remaining frozen long enough or becoming thick enough to carry heavy trucks (see EDM, March 12, 2024; Nakanune, January 28, February 20; The Barents Observer, February 25). This issue is exacerbated by what some scholars are now calling the 'Atlantification' of the Arctic. This refers to the influx of warm water from the Atlantic Ocean into the Arctic Ocean, which is itself caused by the increasing amount of sea ice melting in the Arctic from Scandinavia to the Bering Strait (Igor V. Polyakov et al., 'Atlantification advances into the Amerasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean,' Science Advances. Vol 11, No. 8 (2025); The Barents Observer, February 25). This trend affects not only the ocean and global weather patterns but also the life of population centers and military bases in northern Russia’s littoral regions. In a growing number of places in the region, the only reliable means of transport is by air. This, however, is a serious limiting factor given the carrying capacity of planes, closing of airports in the region, and inadequate roads and rail lines connecting to them. As Sergey Sulyma, a Russia historian who specializes in transportation issues, points out, Russian officials like to brag that jet planes have reduced the time it takes to get from Moscow to Chukotka, located in the extreme northeast of the Russian Federation, to only eight hours (REX Information Agency, February 10). This claim omits the fact that it takes days or even weeks for passengers and cargo to travel to and from the airport in Chukotka because of the absence of year-round roads (REX Information Agency, February 10). These delays mean that the region is not reliably supplied with goods, which has unsurprisingly led to a slow but steady emigration out of Chukotka (see EDM, July 6, 2021; Nakanune, January 28, February 20). This trend, broadly mirrored across the Russian North, makes it almost impossible to maintain the development of natural resources, the maintenance of NSR-related search and rescue institutions or guidance facilities, or the support of military facilities Moscow needs to project power further into the Arctic. Insufficient highways and rail lines represent only one example of the failure of the Russian government to support regional infrastructure in the North. Another problem involves pipelines. The shifting ground with the melting of permafrost has caused pipelines to fail, spilling their contents and even leading to their abandonment on occasion, as continuous repairs are too expensive. This means oil and gas recovered in the Russian North often does not reach the central areas of Russia where they can be used or exported. In turn, population centers and military bases in the Russian North do not receive a steady supply of the petroleum products they need. Russian officials have long been worried by this fact and in 2017 prepared a 900-page report detailing just how dire the situation had become (Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment of the Russian Federation via Web Archive, 2018; The Barents Observer, October 2, 2018; Window on Eurasia, October 2, 2018). There is no reason to think that the situation has improved since then, and every reason to believe that it has gotten worse as the topic appears to have become politically sensitive in Moscow. The impact of global warming on the Arctic Ocean and Russian littoral is especially great with regard to Russian military facilities in the region. Putin has an expansive plan to develop the Arctic seabed and has made claims to portions of the Arctic that are contested by other Arctic states. These claims remain under consideration at the United Nations vis-a-vis its Law of the Sea-mandated process (Window on Eurasia, August 25, 2022, December 27, 2023). Putin’s efforts to develop Russia’s military bases in the North in accordance with his Arctic aspirations have been largely constrained. This is due to the high costs and difficulties of transporting supplies to such facilities, on top of the problems which Russia is experiencing in shipbuilding for its Arctic Fleet (Window on Eurasia, January 19, 2022). Moscow has, as a result, cut back and sought cheaper means of projecting power by building low-cost drone bases and potentially exploring options to purchase ships from elsewhere (see EDM, July 6, 2021, April 18, 2024; , October 15, 2023, October 26, 2024). As Russia’s Arctic territory continues to warm, the combination of its impact on the ocean and the littoral will only intensify. With less ice on the Arctic Ocean, more ships from other countries will likely make use of the NSR or regions adjoining it, creating a situation in which Moscow will feel even more threatened and prepare to be in a position to respond militarily (Window on Eurasia, August 6, 2024). With higher temperatures on land in the Russian Far North, however, Moscow will find it increasingly difficult to implement such a policy, given the unlikelihood of having either the necessary population or military bases in the region. Moscow will thus likely be inclined to adopt a more aggressive approach to any new international presence in the region, potentially by employing forces further from the Arctic itself (see EDM, May 30, 2024). Such a shift in Russian strategy and tactics will require corresponding shifts by others as the Arctic heats up—both literally and figuratively.

Pakistan’s Path Forward Requires More Than Economic Recovery – An...	By Saima Nawaz Pakistan’s 2024 witnessed economic uncertainties, political instability, social unrest and the resurgence of terrorism, marking a grim period. These challenges were not isolated incidents, but manifestations of a broader systemic failure that has persisted for decades. The inability to address these issues comprehensively has left the country in a state of crisis, demanding a transformational change in governance and planning. The February 2024 election was one of the most rigid and contested elections in Pakistan’s history, resulting in a fragile coalition government led by the Pakistan Muslim League with the support of the Pakistan People’s Party. The election deepened polarisation and raised questions about the legitimacy of key institutions such as the election commission, the judiciary and the central authority. 2024 saw a significant increase in terrorist activities along the border, especially with Afghanistan, exacerbating national security concerns. Pakistan’s abysmally low ranking in political stability deterred investment, hampered governance and undermined the long-term prospects of the nation. But the completion of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement and the signing of a new US$7 billion Extended Fund Facility for three years provided much-needed economic support. Additional support through rollovers of deposits from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates stabilised the external account. These developments were accompanied by significant macroeconomic improvements. The policy rate fell from 22 per cent to 12 per cent, inflation dropped from 29.7 per cent in December 2023 to 4.1 per cent by December 2024 and remittances surged by 32.8 per cent. This helped the current account post a provisional US$1.2 billion surplus for the second half of 2025. The stock market reflected renewed confidence, with unprecedented gains signalling optimism among investors. Despite macroeconomic stabilisation, GDP growth in July–September 2024 was 0.9 per cent, driven primarily by agriculture. The industrial sector — which holds the key to export-driven growth — continued to struggle with negative growth, a worrying sign for a country striving to build export surpluses. Pakistan will hardly manage 3 per cent GDP growth in 2025. Rising poverty and persistent unemployment further compounded the socioeconomic challenges. Pakistan’s tax base remained critically narrow and fiscal deficits are raising concerns about debt sustainability. Public debt-to-GDP ratios remained high, with increasing reliance on external borrowing to meet fiscal obligations. Despite efforts to improve investor confidence, actual foreign direct investment inflows in 2024 fell short of projections. The Federal Board of Revenue also failed to meet its tax collection targets despite imposing heavy taxes. Pakistan continues to lag in adopting modern technology-driven economic solutions. Internet access remained slow and inconsistent, hindering e-business and innovation, while public sector inefficiencies continued to plague governance. As 2025 begins, Pakistan faces a critical juncture. Pakistan launched the Uraan Pakistan five-year plan to redefine the country’s economic trajectory, but its success hinges on a fundamental shift in how challenges are addressed. The Vision 2025 and Vision 2047 initiatives had been presented with similar ambitions but lacked effective government assessment and follow-up. Uraan Pakistan is following the same pattern, not incorporating lessons from past failures, risking the repetition of unfulfilled promises rather than ensuring implementation. Pakistan needs a new direction — a systems-based framework that addresses the interconnectedness of its challenges and charts a path towards sustainable progress. A systems-based model views Pakistan’s challenges as interconnected elements of a larger ecosystem. Each stakeholder — the parliament, the establishment, the judiciary, the media, civil society, academia and the public — represents a critical node in this system. Any dysfunction in one node inevitably disrupts the entire system, as was evident in 2024. Parliament’s inability to legislate effectively created policy gridlock, while judicial overreach undermined executive authority. Media sensationalism fuelled social unrest and bureaucratic inefficiency stalled reforms. Economic transformation must be predicated upon systemic reform. Pakistan needs to transition from a fragmented and crisis-driven model to an integrated ecosystem that prioritises innovation, inclusivity and sustainability. Regulatory simplification is essential to make it easier for businesses to operate, while the tax base must be broadened to reduce fiscal deficits and directed towards digital infrastructure and human capital development. Industrial revitalisation is critical — targeted incentives and technological improvements can drive export-led growth and integrate Pakistan into global value chains. The Uraan plan must be recalibrated to reflect these priorities. Digital transformation should be at the forefront, with investments in high-speed internet and digital infrastructure that enable e-commerce and innovation. Education reforms are equally vital and research and development should be incentivised to foster innovation. Political stability is the linchpin of systemic reform. A national dialogue involving all political parties and civil society is essential to build consensus on critical reforms. Transparent electoral processes are needed, and governance must focus on long-term objectives that transcend party lines. Transparency and accountability must begin at the top, with the prime minister and cabinet leading by example. 2025 must not be another year of inertia. It must be the year Pakistan breaks free from the cycles of crisis that have defined its past. This is not an easy path, but it is the only path forward. The systemic approach is not just about solving problems — it is about creating a framework where problems are less likely to arise in the first place. It is about shifting from reactive governance to proactive, integrated planning. Pakistan has the potential to emerge stronger, but this requires bold decisions, unwavering commitment and a shared vision for the future.

Regional Dynamics: The Evolving Iran-Armenia Relationship Amid Ge...	Introduction In today's rapidly changing geopolitical landscape, Armenia and Iran are seeking to strengthen their connections regarding economic, political, and security matters. And despite the United States signing a Strategic Partnership Charter with Armenia in January to enhance cooperation in energy, defense, security, and diplomacy, Tehran asserts that U.S.-Armenia relations will not impact its relationship with Armenia. Iran is in a significantly different position today compared to just a few months ago. Following the collapse of the Assad regime last December and the uncertainty surrounding its proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon, Iran may need to realign its regional priorities. Historically Iran and Armenia have had a very healthy and cordial relationship. Iran and Armenia’s relationship can be seen as a mutually beneficial economic collaboration built around investments, trade agreements, and infrastructure projects. Iran today remains Armenia’s third largest trading partner, and an estimated 30% of Armenia’s international trade runs through Iran. During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, Iran tried to broker a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, hoping to establish itself as a regional negotiator. Now with Iran’s future in the Middle East appearing more uncertain, it may begin to play a greater role with its neighbor to the north. One area where Iran might increase its focus is the Zangezur Corridor, a proposed transport route running through southern Armenia designed to connect Azerbaijan with its exclave, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Here, Armenia and Iran have found common ground in their opposition to Azerbaijan’s proposed corridor. At the same time, recent diplomatic meetings between Iran and Armenia, signalling each other’s willingness to work across a multitude of issues, coupled with Iran’s increased economic activity with the Eurasian region, indicate a potential pivot towards deeper cooperation that could reshape the region. A Brief History Armenia and Iran share a rich history spanning over 2,500 years. We can find the first mention of the word 'Armenia' from the Persian king Darius during the 4th century BC. Up until the early 19th century, Yerevan was part of the Qajari (Persian)Empire. In Yerevan, the Blue Mosque, the residence of the viceroy of the Shah is preserved to this day as a religious and cultural center. In the 1990s the Armenian government renovated the Blue Mosque for services for Armenia’s Iranian Muslim community. In Iran, there remains a strong Armenian diaspora of around 60-80,000 people, while the Armenian Apostolic Church operates its three dioceses in Atrpatrkan, Tehran, and Isfahan. Since the beginning of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1992, Iran and Armenia have strived to maintain a strong relationship. The two countries have shown a strong history of working together on issues surrounding energy, transport, environmental protection, inter-regional, scientist-education, and cultural spheres. February Meetings On Saturday, February 22, the head of Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) Mohammad Ali Dehaqan Devi met with Armenian Deputy Economy Minister EdgarZakaryan and Armenia’s Ambassador Grigor Hovhannisyanin Tehran. They emphasized Iran and Armenia's strong relationship while highlighting the need to increase trade relationships between the two countries. Iranian officials stressed their country’s interest in strengthening trade relations with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEA). Zakaryan highlighted the significant potential for economic collaboration between the two neighboring countries, stressing the importance of this in achieving their trading objectives, saying 'Armenia is prepared to collaborate with Iran across various sectors to strengthen mutual trade relations,'. Just two days later on February 24 Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi and Armenian Foreign Minister Arat Mirzyoan were present in Geneva to attend a high-level meeting of the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Disarmament Conference. While in Geneva, they held a bilateral meeting to discuss relations between their two countries. Here they reaffirmed their desire to strengthen bilateral ties concerning trade and economic growth. Araghchi emphasized the need to protect state sovereignty in the South Caucus region and for continued cooperation and coordination in security and stability. Mirzoyan, on his side, emphasized Armenia's commitment to strengthening ties with Iran across various sectors, including economic, trade, cultural, and transportation areas. Araghchi reaffirmed Tehran’s readiness to support peace efforts between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 'We strive for peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan and are ready to support this process. EAEU On February 28 Mehr News Agency, a semi-official news agency of the government of Iran, reported that the Iranian parliament has approved the agreement to create a free trade zone between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). This comes just two months after Iran was granted observer status in the EAEU. Iranian Minister of Industry, Mines, and Trade, Mohammed Atabk said, 'The free trade agreement with Eurasia allows us to export 87% of our goods to the Eurasian Economic Union member states at zero tariffs and import goods from these countries at zero tariffs. The total population of the Eurasian Economic Union member states is 240 million people, so it is a huge market that can be used,'. The free trade agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union and Iran should take effect by April or early May. The EAEU is a regional, political, and economic union made up of the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Russian Federation. The EAEU provides for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor, while pursuing a unified policy across various sectors, including transport, industry, agriculture, energy, and foreign trade. Iran's exports to the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) rose by 22 percent, amounting to $1.631 billion, in the first ten months of the current Iranian calendar year (from March 20, 2024, to January 19, 2025). Economic analysts have suggested that the Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement could exceed $10 billion annually within a few years. In addition to trade, the agreement may promote joint ventures, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer in sectors like energy, transportation, and manufacturing. The Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement is a significant step forward, emphasizing regional economic cooperation in an increasingly interconnected global economy. As it nears implementation, the agreement is expected to reshape economic ties between Iran and the Eurasian region. Nagorno Karabakh and the Zangezur Corridor During the initial days of the Nagorno-Kabrabkah conflict, Iran had sought to create a peace plan between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In a televised address Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei spoke about Azerbaijani territorial recognition yet made clear that the rights and security of Armenians 'must be ensured'. Armenia and Azerbaijan eventually came to a settlement brokered via the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Minsk Group. Armenia claims it did not explicitly reject Iran’s attempts at brokering peace but instead preferred going through the OSCE Minks Group. During the 2020 Karabakh War, Azerbaijani media accused Iran of supporting Armenia with arms and fuel. Recently, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has criticized Iran for fuel transfers to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Azerbaijan’s suspicion of Iran was only further enforced when in July 2024, it was reported that Iran and Armenia had signed a secret arms deal worth $500 million, which includes drone and air defense missiles, among other various military equipment. Following Azerbaijan’s victory in the Karabakh War, a trilateral ceasefire agreement alongside Russia was signed that included provisions for the opening of transportation routes. This provision, article 9 stated, 'All economic and transport connections in the region shall be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia shall guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions.' Azerbaijan strongly believes that Article 9 gives it the right to open the Zangezur Corridor. Armenia, however, is firmly against this belief, claiming that it does not view the Zangezur Corridor as a route or a corridor. Armenia’s opposition to the corridor is founded on its concerns over national security, sovereignty, and historical grievances. Yet, Armenia has found a partner in Iran in its opposition to the corridor. Motivated by worries that the initiative could diminish its status as a key regional transit center and weaken its strategic influence in the South Caucasus, Iran is strongly against the creation of the Zangezur Corridor. Iran’s Opposition to the Zangezur Corridor Friendly Relations with Armenia: Iran has historically maintained friendly relations with Armenia and supports Armenia’s sovereignty. Reduced Energy Demand: A pipeline built along the Zangezur pipeline would carry more oil and gas to southern Europe and reduce European demand for Iranian hydrocarbons. Challenges in Sanction Negotiations: A weakened Iran could complicate the country’s efforts to negotiate relief from international sanctions. Transit Role for Azerbaijani Citizens: Iran acts as a transit country for Azerbaijani citizens traveling to Nakhchivan, providing Tehran with leverage over Azerbaijan. Pan-Turkish Aspirations: Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has said the corridor could be used to unite the Turkish world, with an estimated 16% of Iran’s population being ethnically Azerbaijani, there are fears that the Zangezur Corridor could led to demands for greater autonomy or even create separatist movements within Iran. Post-Assad Era: As Iran’s supply lines to the Levant face increasing threats, the Zangezur Corridor could further isolate Iran and significantly diminish its influence in the South Caucasus. Opportunities for Further Cooperation USAID: In February, the Trump administration announced plans to cut 90% of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) 's foreign aid contracts, slashing global assistance by $60 billion. Armenia had received $110 million of the $250 million initially pledged to it by USAID for 2024 before the funding freezes were implemented. Critics of Trump's decision to dismantle USAID caution that this opens the door for Russia to expand its influence in Central and Eastern Europe, however, it also presents an opportunity for Iran to deepen its ties with Armenia. With a less active US presence in the region, Iran is hoping to capitalize on strengthening its relationship with Armenia and the Eurasia region. Continued Economic Cooperation: In 2023, bilateral trade grew by 43%, accompanied by the implementation of five major infrastructure projects, including the expansion of the North-South Highway, modernization of border crossings, and development of energy infrastructure. In 2024, a $15 million investment in Yerevan established a joint technology park, focusing on IT and biotechnology cooperation. That same year the Iranian Trade Center in Yerevan was launched, providing essential services such as financial transactions, logistics, legal advice, and customs support. This ongoing trade and investment between Iran and Armenia will ensure that both countries continue to gain from their partnership Persian Gulf-Black Sea Corridor: To countermeasure Turkiye and the Zangezur Corridor, India, Iran, and Armenia have proposed working together to create a Persian Gulf-Black Sea Transit Corridor (PBTC). Initially proposed by Iran in 2016, the PBTC aims to link Europe with India through Armenian territory and Iranian ports, effectively bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal. This initiative seeks to streamline cargo transit, enhance infrastructure, and simplify shipping procedures. The project also hopes to compete with Türkiye’s Development Road, which connects Europe and Türkiye via the Great Faw Port in Iraq, cutting 15 days of transit time by circumventing the Suez Canal. By establishing a connection between Armenia and India and China, the PBTC looks to offer an alternative to Türkiye’s Development Road and the Suez Canal, which would unlock new trade and investment opportunities for both Armenia and Iran. Conclusion Armenia and Iran are connected through a shared history, culture, and geography, making Armenia one of the few countries that truly aligns with Iran's economic and geopolitical interests. The partnership between Armenia and Iran reflects a strategic alignment shaped by shared geopolitical interests and historical ties. This partnership, driven by mutual strategic, economic, and security objectives, seeks to counter Türkiye and Azerbaijan's increasing influence in the region while enhancing trade and investment between them. With Iran’s ouster from Syria last December, and the uncertainty of its influence over the rest of the Middle East, Iran may begin to place a greater focus on Armenia and the Eurasian region. Recent diplomatic meetings have emphasized the importance of enhancing trade with the EAEU, as Iran seeks to increase its economic activity in the region and gain greater access to European markets. Iran is expecting the Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement to significantly boost trade and promote regional economic cooperation. By strengthening trade with the EAEU and boosting ties with Armenia, Iran could help offset some of its losses in the Middle East, while counterbalancing Türkiye’s rising influence over the region. Additionally, although the Persian Gulf-Black Sea Corridor is still just a proposal, its implementation could significantly benefit the economies and the global presence of both Iran and Armenia. In a constantly shifting geopolitical environment, Iran can find reassurance in its partnership with Armenia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeI5vp5sYp-nvw6FR-a0AHP	2025-03-04T17:04:26-08:00	
Lent As Pilgrims Of Hope – OpEd	Lent is a season of profound spiritual significance, a time when we are called to journey inward and outward, to reflect on our lives, and to renew our commitment to Christ. As male and female religious, missionaries, and priests, we are uniquely positioned to embrace this season as 'pilgrims of hope.' Our vocation calls us to be witnesses of the Gospel, to embody the hope of Christ in a world often marked by despair, division, and uncertainty. This reflection seeks to explore what it means to live Lent as pilgrims of hope, drawing from the experiences of religious life, missionary work, and priestly ministry. A pilgrim is someone on a journey, often to a sacred place, seeking transformation and deeper communion with God. Lent invites us to become pilgrims, not necessarily in the physical sense, but in the spiritual sense. We are called to leave behind the familiar comforts of our routines, our habits, and even our sins, to embark on a journey of conversion. This pilgrimage is not a solitary endeavor; it is a communal journey with Christ and with one another. As religious, we are already pilgrims by virtue of our vows. Poverty calls us to detach from material possessions and to trust in God’s providence. Chastity invites us to love freely and purely, directing our hearts toward the divine. Obedience challenges us to surrender our will to God’s plan, even when the path is unclear. These vows are not burdens but gifts that free us to journey more deeply into the heart of God. For missionaries, the pilgrimage of Lent takes on an added dimension. Missionaries are called to go to the peripheries, to places where hope is scarce, and to be bearers of Christ’s light. This requires a willingness to step out of our comfort zones, to encounter the unfamiliar, and to trust that God is already at work in the lives of those we serve. I recall a missionary priest who spent years in a remote village in Africa. He often spoke of the challenges of learning a new language, adapting to a different culture, and facing the harsh realities of poverty and disease. Yet, amidst these difficulties, he found profound hope in the faith of the people he served. Their joy and resilience in the face of adversity were a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel. Hope is the virtue that sustains us on our pilgrimage. It is not a naive optimism or a passive wishfulness, but a confident trust in God’s promises. Hope reminds us that, no matter how dark the present moment may seem, God’s love and mercy will ultimately prevail. As St. Paul writes, 'Hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us' (Romans 5:5). For priests, hope is at the heart of our ministry. We are called to be instruments of God’s grace, to bring hope to the hopeless, and to remind people of their dignity as children of God. I think of a priest who served in a prison ministry. He often encountered men and women who had lost all sense of hope, who felt abandoned by God and society. Through his presence, his prayers, and his words of encouragement, he helped them to see that they were not beyond redemption, that God’s mercy was greater than their sins. This is the hope we are called to embody as priests: a hope that speaks of forgiveness, healing, and new beginnings. The traditional practices of Lent, prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, are not ends in themselves but means of deepening our hope in God. Through prayer, we cultivate a relationship with the One who is the source of all hope. Fasting helps us to detach from the things that distract us from God and to hunger more deeply for His presence. Almsgiving reminds us that our hope is not just for ourselves but for the entire human family, especially the poor and marginalized. For religious, these practices take on a communal dimension. Our communal prayer, whether it be the Liturgy of the Hours or the celebration of the Eucharist, is a powerful expression of hope. It is a reminder that we are not alone on this journey, that we are part of a larger body of believers who are striving to live the Gospel. I remember a religious community that dedicated their Lenten season to praying for peace in a war-torn region. Each day, they gathered to intercede for those affected by violence, trusting that their prayers could make a difference. Their hope was not in their own efforts but in the power of God to bring about peace. Fasting, too, can be a communal act of hope. By giving up something we enjoy, we are reminded of our dependence on God and our solidarity with those who go without. I think of a religious sister who fasted from social media during Lent. She found that this small sacrifice freed her to be more present to the people around her and to spend more time in prayer. Her fasting was not just a personal discipline but a witness to others of the joy that comes from putting God first. Almsgiving is perhaps the most tangible expression of hope. It is a way of sharing our resources with those in need, trusting that God will provide for us as well. I recall a missionary who worked in a slum community. During Lent, she organized a food drive to help families struggling with hunger. What struck me was not just the generosity of those who donated but the hope it inspired in the recipients. For many, it was a reminder that they were not forgotten, that God was working through others to provide for them. Of course, the journey of hope is not without its challenges. There are times when we may feel discouraged, when the weight of the world’s suffering seems too much to bear. We may wonder if our efforts are making a difference, if our prayers are being heard. In these moments, it is important to remember that hope is not based on our own strength but on God’s faithfulness. I think of a priest who served in a parish that was struggling with division and conflict. Despite his best efforts, the situation seemed to only get worse. He felt overwhelmed and began to doubt his ability to make a difference. Yet, in prayer, he was reminded that his role was not to fix everything but to be a witness to Christ’s love and mercy. This realization gave him the strength to persevere, to continue reaching out to those who were hurting, and to trust that God was at work, even in ways he could not see. For missionaries, the challenges to hope can be even more acute. They may face rejection, hostility, or even danger in their work. Yet, it is precisely in these moments that their witness to hope is most powerful. I think of a missionary who was imprisoned for his faith. Despite the harsh conditions, he continued to pray for his captors and to share the Gospel with his fellow prisoners. His hope was not in his own freedom but in the promise of eternal life with Christ. His witness inspired many, including some of his captors, to turn to God. As we journey through Lent, we are reminded that our hope is not in vain. The Resurrection of Christ is the ultimate source of our hope. It is the assurance that death and sin do not have the final word, that God’s love is stronger than anything we may face. This hope sustains us in our darkest moments and gives us the courage to continue our pilgrimage. For religious, missionaries, and priests, the Resurrection is the foundation of our vocation. It is the reason we can embrace poverty, chastity, and obedience, knowing that our true treasure is in heaven. It is the reason we can go to the peripheries, trusting that Christ is already there, waiting for us. It is the reason we can minister to the broken and the lost, confident that God’s grace can transform even the most hardened hearts. I think of a religious sister who worked with victims of human trafficking. She often spoke of the pain and suffering she encountered, but she also spoke of the hope she found in the resilience of the women she served. Many of them had experienced unimaginable trauma, yet through the sister’s love and support, they began to see themselves as beloved children of God. This was a powerful reminder that the Resurrection is not just a future hope but a present reality, breaking into our world through acts of love and mercy. As we journey through this Lenten season, let us embrace our identity as pilgrims of hope. Let us be men and women who radiate the hope of Christ, who remind the world that no matter how dark the night may seem, the dawn is coming. Let us be religious, missionaries, and priests who live our vows with joy and fidelity, who go to the peripheries with courage and compassion, and who minister to God’s people with love and mercy. May our prayer, fasting, and almsgiving be expressions of our hope in God’s promises. May we face the challenges of our pilgrimage with faith and perseverance, trusting that God is with us every step of the way. And may we always keep our eyes fixed on the Resurrection, the ultimate source of our hope, as we strive to bring the light of Christ to a world in need. In the words of St. Augustine, 'We are an Easter people, and ‘Alleluia’ is our song.' Let us live this Lent as pilgrims of hope, singing the song of 'Alleluia' with our lives, and bearing witness to the joy of the Gospel.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevXGYPT28bm6U	2025-03-04T15:29:02-08:00	
Madrid Leads Development Of Quantum-Safe Communications Through T...	The Regional Government of Madrid is strengthening its commitment to quantum communications with an investment of 16 million euros in research projects on quantum communications and cybersecurity within the framework of the International Year of Quantum Science and Technologies declared by UNESCO. Among the initiatives the regional government is promoting stands out MadQuantum-CM, which aims to expand the largest quantum communications network in Europe, MadQCI, positioning itself as a strategic initiative for the development of secure quantum communications in Europe. At IMDEA Networks, as one of the project participants, we lead the development of next-generation quantum communication protocols. ‘Our work is focused on creating solutions that extend the reach and functionality of quantum networks, ensuring their integration with current communications infrastructures’, explains Albert Banchs, IMDEA Networks’ principal researcher on the project. Meanwhile, 5TONIC, the open research and innovation laboratory created by Telefónica and IMDEA Networks, plays a fundamental role together with the Universidad Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M), as a validation and testing centre of new technologies for the control of quantum communication networks. As such, a solution has been developed for secure end-to-end key distribution based on cloud native and QKD (quantum key distribution) technologies, which has been evaluated by means of a digital twin for QKD networks, also developed in the context of the project. This solution will be experimentally validated on a hybrid PQC/QKD (Post-Quantum cryptography/QKD) multi-domain testbed deployed in the 5TONIC laboratory. ‘Our facilities allow us to evaluate quantum communications protocols and equipment in real operating conditions, a crucial step for its future commercial implementation,’ explains Carlos J. Bernardos, vice-president of 5TONIC and full professor at UC3M. With the purpose of extending the largest quantum communications network in Europe, the deployment of the MadQuantum-CM project relies on Telefónica’s fibre optic infrastructure, over which quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are implemented. This combination of cutting-edge telecommunications infrastructure with quantum technology will guarantee inherently secure communications based on the principles of quantum mechanics. The MadQuantum-CM consortium, coordinated by the Universidad Politécnica of Madrid, includes the participation of leading institutions such as the National Institute for Aerospace Technology, the Spanish Metrology Centre, the Fundación Vithas, the Universidad Autónoma of Madrid and the Universidad Complutense of Madrid. The project is funded by the European Union through NextGenerationEU funds, by the Community of Madrid and by the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (PRTR) in the framework of the Complementary Quantum Communication Plan, with a total investment of 73 million euros. The project’s key objectives include the development of new, more efficient and secure quantum communication protocols, the integration of QKD technologies into conventional communications networks, the training of specialised researchers to boost the national industry, and the creation of use cases in critical sectors such as healthcare, energy and public services. 5TONIC, as a laboratory of reference in the development of 5G and 6G technologies, facilitating collaboration between academia and industry, also contributes to technological development in the field of quantum communications. ‘The synergy between the different ecosystem players, from operators such as Telefónica to research centres such as UC3M and IMDEA Networks, is fundamental to the success of the project,’ adds Bernardos. The development of quantum communications has become a strategic priority for both Europe and Spain, with Madrid being a reference hub for the research and development of these fundamental technologies for the security of future communications. The collaboration between 5TONIC, Telefónica (which is deploying the MadQCI fibre network) and IMDEA Networks in the framework of MadQuantum-CM exemplifies the innovation model needed to lead this technological revolution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTeva9UjjLtOOEa	2025-03-04T15:25:29-08:00	
The Complex Effects Of Pesticide Exposure On Bumble Bee Health	The effects of pesticide exposure on pollinator health may be more complicated than originally thought, according to a team of researchers in Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences who recently published an article on the topic in Biology Letters. In the study, the researchers examined the effects of imidacloprid, a common insecticide, on bumble bees. They found that while exposure to the insecticide was associated with shorter lifespans and reduced reproduction, low doses also were associated with new queens surviving longer in diapause. This phenomenon of hormesis — when low doses of a normally fatal toxin actually benefit an insect — is poorly understood in pollinators, and these short-term benefits often come at a cost, said Etya Amsalem, associate professor of entomology at Penn State and lead author on the study. 'If hormesis goes unrecognized, it could lead to the mistaken conclusion that certain pesticides benefit bees,' Amsalem said. 'Such a misconception is dangerous, given the well-documented negative effects of imidacloprid and the trade-offs associated with hormetic responses — where short-term benefits trade-off with long-term fitness.' Amsalem added that a useful analogy for hormesis is caffeine: In small amounts, it can be beneficial, but at high doses, it becomes toxic. 'Even low doses can have unintended effects, such as disrupting sleep,' she said. 'Just as coffee drinkers should be aware of its multiple effects, researchers and policymakers must account for hormesis when evaluating pesticide impacts on pollinators.' Pennsylvania’s native bumble bee queens are particularly vulnerable to outside pressures, such as harsh winters, according to the researchers. A bumble bee queen must go through diapause — a dormant stage that enables an insect to withstand harsh environmental conditions — to survive to the spring, when she can start a new colony. Over 75% of a queen bumblebee’s life can be spent in diapause — a significant amount of time when the bee faces extreme temperatures, possible infections and starvation. And if she doesn’t survive this period, she will not be able to establish a new colony of bumblebees, meaning the world can lose up to hundreds of potential pollinators with every dying queen. 'But diapause is poorly understood,' Amsalem said. 'And despite the fact that most pollinators undergo winter diapause, pesticide risk assessments typically focus on the bee’s active seasons, overlooking a significant portion of the bee’s life cycle.' During active seasons, pesticides are known to have detrimental effects on pollinators, Amsalem said. Many pesticides can dissolve in water, where plants can absorb and transport them into their pollen and nectar. When this happens, pesticide residues can be picked up by beneficial insects — such as bees and other pollinators. This pesticide exposure can cause immediate death or a decreased lifespan and inability to reproduce. To assess the impacts of one of the most widely used neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid, during both the active season and diapause, the researchers mixed imidacloprid with sugar water and fed the solution to bumble bees. They then assessed the total lifespan of males, workers and queens and measured reproductive output in the females. 'The results were straightforward: Higher concentrations led to shorter lifespans and fewer offspring, a typical and expected response of bees to neonicotinoids,' Amsalem said, noting that while neonicotinoids are banned in Europe, they make up about a quarter of the global pesticide market. Amsalem said what came next was a little more surprising. 'In the second experiment, we fed queens sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid, induced diapause by placing them in cold storage and monitored survival weekly,' she said. 'Surprisingly, we found that sublethal imidacloprid exposure actually improved the queens' survival.' The researchers found that these queens were unexpectedly more resilient against harsh winter conditions after pesticide exposure. Amsalem recommended that these findings be integrated into risk assessment and conservation management strategies for bumblebees. She also argued that these hormetic responses need to be studied further to assess the reasons why these responses occurred. Knowing the mechanism, she said, may give scientists a broader understanding of insect responses to pesticides. 'Most importantly, we must strive to conduct nuanced science that provides a holistic understanding of how stressors affect pollinators — ensuring better-informed conservation efforts,' Amsalem said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevXGTN7vWPqUd	2025-03-04T15:23:23-08:00	
James Webb Telescope Reveals Planet-Forming Disks Can Last Longer...	If there were such a thing as a photo album of the universe, it might include snapshots of pancake-like disks of gas and dust, swirling around newly formed stars across the Milky Way. Known as planet-forming disks, they are believed to be a short-lived feature around most, if not all, young stars, providing the raw materials for planets to form. Most of these planetary nurseries are short-lived, typically lasting only about 10 million years – a fleeting existence by cosmic standards. Now, in a surprising find, researchers at the University of Arizona have discovered that disks can grace their host stars much longer than previously thought, provided the stars are small – one-tenth of the sun's mass or less. In a paper published in the Astrophysical Letters Journal, a research team led by Feng Long of the U of A Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, in the College of Science, reports a detailed observation of a protoplanetary disk at the ripe old age of 30 million years. Presenting the first detailed chemical analysis of a long-lived disk using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the paper provides new insights into planet formation and the habitability of planets outside our solar system. 'In a sense, protoplanetary disks provide us with baby pictures of planetary systems, including a glimpse of what our solar system may have looked like in its infancy,' said Long, the paper's lead author and a Sagan Fellow with the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. As long as the star has a certain mass, high-energy radiation from the young star blows the gas and dust out of the disk, and it can no longer serve as raw material to build planets, Long explained. The team observed a star with the official designation WISE J044634.16–262756.1B – more conveniently known as J0446B – located in the constellation Columba (Latin for 'dove') about 267 light-years from Earth. The researchers found that its planet-forming disk has lasted about three times longer than expected. 'Although we know that most disks disperse within 10 million to 20 million years, we are finding that for specific types of stars, their disks can last much longer,' Long said. 'Because materials in the disk provide the raw materials for planets, the disk's lifespan determines how much time the system has to form planets.' Even though tiny stars retain their disks longer, their disk's chemical makeup does not change significantly. The similar chemical composition regardless of age indicates that the chemistry does not change drastically even as a disk reaches an advanced age. Such a long-lived, stable chemical environment could provide planets around low-mass stars with more time to form. By analyzing the disk's gas content, the researchers ruled out the possibility that the disk around J0446B is a so-called debris disk, a longer-lasting type of disk that consists of second-generation material produced by collisions of asteroid-like bodies. 'We detected gases like hydrogen and neon, which tells us that there is still primordial gas left in the disk around J0446B,' said Chengyan Xie, a doctoral student at LPL who also contributed to the study. The confirmed existence of long-lived disks rich in gases has implications for life outside our solar system, according to the authors. Of particular interest to researchers is the TRAPPIST-1 system, located 40 light-years from Earth, consisting of a red dwarf star and seven planets similar in size to Earth. Three of those planets are located in the 'habitable zone,' where conditions allow for liquid water to exist and offer the potential for life to form, at least in principle. Because stars with long-lived planetary disks fall into a similar mass category as the central star in the TRAPPIST-1 system, the existence of long-lived disks is especially interesting for the evolution of planetary systems, say Long and her co-authors. 'To make the specific arrangement of orbits we see with TRAPPIST-1, planets need to migrate inside the disk, a process that requires the presence of gas,' said Ilaria Pascucci, a professor of planetary sciences at LPL who co-authored the study. 'The long presence of gas we find in those disks might be the reason behind TRAPPIST-1's unique arrangement.' Long-lived disks have not been found for high-mass stars such as the sun, since stars in such systems evolve much more quickly and planets have less time to form. Although our solar system took a different evolutionary route, long-lived disks can tell researchers a lot about the universe, the authors noted, because low-mass stars are believed to vastly outnumber sun-like stars. 'Developing a better understanding of how low-mass star systems evolve and getting snapshots of long-lived disks might help pave the way to filling out the blanks in the photo album of the universe,' Long said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevTlM4tpF5u0R	2025-03-04T15:21:36-08:00	
Sleep Health May Impact Mobility For Women With Chronic Condition...	Poor sleep health can lead to many daily problems, and for people with chronic illnesses, one of those problems can be difficulty with daily movement. Researchers from University of Michigan Health used data from the Nurse’s Health Study - a cohort study of more than 70,000 women nurses followed over time with surveys given every 2 years and used the dataset to focus on the impact of sleep on future mobility, with a special focus on chronic health conditions that are known to affect mobility. The study findings, published in Sleep Epidemiology suggested that poor sleep health predicted a decline in mobility over the eight years following a chronic health diagnosis. Women with diabetes, osteoarthritis or multiple sclerosis who also had signs or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea were more particularly likely to have future problems with mobility compared to counterparts who didn’t have signs of sleep apnea. 'Poor sleep is often overlooked or assumed to be a consequence of aging, functional decline or disability in those with chronic health conditions,' said senior author Tiffany J. Braley, M.D., M.S., associate professor of neurology. 'However, sleep disturbances and disorders may also be an upstream contributor to these issues,' said Braley, also the director of the multiple sclerosis and neuroimmunology division at the University of Michigan Health. 'Treating sleep problems can have positive effects on other parts of life, including physical functions like mobility. In our clinical experiences within medical and rehabilitation contexts, we have observed that how someone is sleeping can have a direct impact on how they engage in physical activities as part of their treatment or self-management,' said first author Daniel Whibley, Ph.D., assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at University of Michigan Health. The study found that signs of obstructive sleep apnea, reported sleep durations outside of the recommended guidelines, and a perception of inadequate sleep were all associated with an increase in the future use of assistive devices to help with mobility, such as a cane or wheelchair. 'Identifying sleep disturbances or signs of a sleep disorder, providing information about healthy sleep habits and referral to a specialist when needed may help to reduce the progression of mobility issues,' said Whibley. 'Our study is the first to observe this association in women, including those with and without long term conditions, making this research important to consider when addressing ways to better the long-term health of women with these conditions.' 'Reasons for these findings may vary depending on the condition, but require further study,' said Braley, who encourages providers to screen patients with chronic conditions for sleep disturbances and refer to sleep specialists early if an underlying sleep disorder is suspected, as 'the vast majority of sleep disorders are highly treatable.' For patients, Whibley recommends speaking up about problems with sleep. 'Consider sleep as an important part of overall health, especially for those who want to take a proactive role in addressing treatable causes of disability,' notes Whibley, 'as it can help patients take control of their physical health.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTeveL2OAKuMJ6a	2025-03-04T15:17:31-08:00	
Giant Clone Of Seaweed In The Baltic Sea	Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have discovered that what was previously thought to be a unique seaweed species of bladderwrack for the Baltic Sea is in fact a giant clone of common bladderwrack, perhaps the world's largest clone overall. The discovery has implications for predicting the future of seaweed in a changing ocean. In the brakish waters of the Baltic Sea, bladderwrack is the dominant seaweed species as it is one of the few seaweed species that can tolerate low salinity. The seaweed forms large forests from the surface down to a depth of 10 metres. Fish fry, snails and crustaceans thrive here, and the kelp forests also provide an important habitat for larger fish. This makes it an interesting species for researchers to study. Using genetic mapping of marine species is one way to understand how these species should be managed. Falsely mistaken for an own species 'The Baltic Sea is entering a period of warmer and probably even fresher seawater. In new conditions, all species must try to adapt in order to survive, including the important bladderwrack,' says Kerstin Johannesson, Professor of Marine Ecology at the University of Gothenburg and one of the lead authors of a new study in the journal Molecular Ecology. Through DNA sequencing, the researchers have found that a small, bushy form of seaweed in the Baltic Sea that was previously thought to be a separate species (called narrow wrack) is a clone of bladderwrack. The clone has formed new populations by dispersing fragments of an original female plant with the water currents and growing into new individuals of wrack. The clone spreads over more than 500 km of the coast of the Bothnian Sea, from Öregrund in Uppland to just south of Umeå, and may be the world's largest clone of any organism. Millions of individuals in one clone Bladderwrack has separate male and female plants that normally form new individuals after sexual fertilisation. 'This clone comprises millions of individuals, and in some areas, it is completely dominant, while in other areas it grows alongside sexually propagated individuals of bladderwrack. We have found a few more large clones in the Baltic Sea, but the female clone off the Swedish Gulf of Bothnia is by far the largest clone – a real super female,' says Ricardo Pereyra, researcher in the group who led the genetic analyses. Uncertain future for clones Seaweed clones face an uncertain future as the Baltic Sea is affected by climate change. Without constant sexual reproduction, there are few genetic changes and adaptations in the genetic material of the stocks. 'A clone almost completely lacks the genetic variation that otherwise means that there are individuals in a population that can handle the changes and make the species survive,' says Kerstin Johannesson. New species in Estonia During the survey, the researchers from the University of Gothenburg also identified a new species of seaweed on the Estonian coast which, like the small seaweed clone, is small and bushy, but has both males and females and reproduces only sexually. This seaweed is very closely related to bladderwrack but is currently reproductively isolated from bladderwrack in the area.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevd9yvk1jmlyp	2025-03-04T15:11:07-08:00	
The First Bronze Age Settlement In The Maghreb	Most Bronze Age settlements have been documented in European territory. Despite its geographical proximity, the Maghreb has always been absent from these historical narratives, erroneously characterized as an ‘empty land’ until the arrival of the Phoenicians around 800 BC. Now, a research study led by Hamza Benattia Melgarejo ( University of Barcelona) has uncovered the first Bronze Age settlement in this geographical area, predating the Phoenician period. This discovery is of great significance for the history of Africa and the Mediterranean. According to the results published in Antiquity, excavations at Kach Kouch, located in northwest Morocco, reveal a human occupation datable to between 2200 and 600 BC. This would show that it would be the earliest site of this chronology in Mediterranean Africa, except for Egypt. The international research team, led by Hamza Benattia Melgarejo, PhD student at the UB’s Faculty of Geography and History and member of the UB’s Classical and Protohistoric Archaeology Research Group, has been working on the prehistoric settlement of Kach Kouch, which extends over an area of approximately one hectare near the Lau River. It is located ten kilometres from the present-day coast, near the Strait of Gibraltar, and thirty kilometres southeast of Tétouan. Excavations have revealed different phases of occupation. The first, from 2200-2000 BC, is poorly represented but significant. The evidence suggests an initial contemporary occupation in the transition from the Bronze Age to neighbouring Iberia. The second phase, 1300-900 BC, is a vibrant period in the history of the settlement. A stable agricultural community was established at Kach Kouch and is the first definitive evidence of sedentary life before the Phoenician presence in the Maghreb. Wooden mud-brick buildings, rock-cut silos and grinding stones reveal a thriving agricultural economy based on crops such as barley and wheat, supplemented by sheep, goats and cattle. A third phase, extending from 800 to 600 BC, demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the inhabitants of Kach Kouch. During this period, several cultural innovations from the eastern Mediterranean were introduced, such as wheel-thrown pottery, iron tools and new architectural traditions using stone. This mix of local and foreign practices illustrates how the community actively participated in Mediterranean exchange networks. 'Kach Kouch is one of the first well-documented examples of continuous settlement in the Maghreb and tells a very different story from the one that has existed for a long time: it shows the history of dynamic local communities that were far from isolated', says Benattia. 'The excavations at this site are another step towards correcting these historical biases and reveal that the Maghreb was an active participant in the social, cultural and economic networks of the Mediterranean', says the UB researcher.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevUUnScAunbRn	2025-03-04T15:08:48-08:00	
World’s Critical Food Crops At Imminent Risk From Rising Temperat...	Global warming is already reshaping our daily lives, with storms, floods, wildfires and droughts around the world. As temperatures continue to rise, a third of global food production could be at risk. Now, a new study in Nature Food offers a more precise picture of exactly where and how warming will affect our ability to grow food. Researchers at Aalto University studied how future changes in temperature, precipitation and aridity will affect growing conditions of 30 major food crop species across the globe. They found that low-latitude regions face significantly worse consequences than mid- or high-latitudes. Depending on the level of warming, up to half of the crop production in low-latitude areas would be at risk as climate conditions become unsuitable for production. At the same time, those regions would also see a large drop in crop diversity. ‘The loss of diversity means that the range of food crops available for cultivation could decrease significantly in certain areas. That would reduce food security and make it more difficult to get adequate calories and protein,’ says Sara Heikonen, the doctoral researcher who led the study. Up to half of the world’s food crop production may be affected Warming will severely decrease the amount of global cropland available for staple crops –– rice, maize, wheat, potato and soybean –– which account for over two-thirds of the world’s food energy intake . In addition, ‘tropical root crops such as yam, which are key to food security in low-income regions, as well as cereals and pulses are particularly vulnerable. In sub-Saharan Africa, the region which would be impacted most, almost three quarters of current production is at risk if global warming exceeds 3°C,’ Heikonen says. By contrast, mid- and high-latitude areas will probably retain their productive land overall, though zones for specific crops will change. These areas are also likely to see an increase in crop diversity. ‘For example, the cultivation of temperate fruits, such as pears, could become more common in more northerly regions,’ says Heikonen. However, even if climatic conditions are favourable, other factors could hamper agriculture in these areas, says the study’s senior author, Professor Matti Kummu. ‘We showed that there’s climatic potential but, for example, warming might bring new pests and extreme weather events, which our model doesn’t include. So the situation isn’t really that black and white.’ Options for adaptation and mitigation Many of the low-latitude regions threatened most by warming are already vulnerable in numerous ways. They face problems with food sufficiency, and economic and systemic forces make them less resilient than northern countries. Nevertheless, Kummu sees ways that these regions could, at least partly, meet the challenge. ‘In many low latitude areas, especially in Africa, the yields are small compared to similar areas elsewhere in the world. They could get higher yields with access to fertilisers and irrigation as well as reducing food losses through the production and storage chain. However, ongoing global warming will add a lot of uncertainty to these estimates and probably even more actions are needed, such as crop selection and novel breeding,’ he says. ‘But I always say that the modelling and analysis is the easy part –– understanding how to make the changes happen is the hardest part.’ While policy-makers in low-latitude countries should work to close those gaps, in mid- and high-latitude regions farmers and policy-makers need more flexibility, says Kummu. Warming will likely change which crops are grown in those areas, and further changes will come from the array of pressures on the global food system. Coping with those changes will require the ability to adjust and adapt as the consequences of climate change unfold. ‘If we want to secure our food system in the future, we need to both mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects,’ says Heikonen. ‘Even if the biggest changes are in equatorial regions, we will all feel the effects through the globalised food system. We need to act together to address these problems.’	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevaPeL2qpKFR1	2025-03-04T15:06:22-08:00	
Heat From the Sun Affects Seismic Activity On Earth	Seismology has revealed much of the basics about earthquakes: Tectonic plates move, causing strain energy to build up, and that energy eventually releases in the form of an earthquake. As for forecasting them, however, there’s still much to learn in order to evacuate cities before catastrophes like the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tōhoku earthquake that, in addition to causing a tsunami that led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, resulted in more than 18,000 deaths. In recent years, research has focused on a possible correlation between the sun or moon and seismic activity on Earth, with some studies pointing to tidal forces or electromagnetic effects interacting with the planet’s crust, core, and mantle. In Chaos, by AIP Publishing, researchers from the University of Tsukuba and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan explored the likelihood that Earth’s climate, as affected by solar heat, plays a role. The study builds on one that a pair of the researchers had published in the same journal in 2022; that study connected solar activity, particularly sunspot numbers, with seismic systems on Earth to establish a causal effect. 'Solar heat drives atmospheric temperature changes, which in turn can affect things like rock properties and underground water movement,' said author Matheus Henrique Junqueira Saldanha. 'Such fluctuations can make rocks more brittle and prone to fracturing, for example — and changes in rainfall and snowmelt can alter the pressure on tectonic plate boundaries. While these factors may not be the main drivers of earthquakes, they could still be playing a role that can help to predict seismic activity.' Using mathematical and computational methods, the researchers analyzed earthquake data alongside solar activity records and surface temperatures on Earth. Among other findings, they observed that when they included Earth surface temperatures into their model, the forecasting became more accurate, especially for shallow earthquakes. 'That makes sense, since heat and water mostly affect the upper layers of the Earth’s crust,' said Junqueira Saldanha. The findings suggest the transfer of solar heat to the surface of the Earth does affect seismic activity, however minutely, and that incorporating solar activity predictions into detailed Earth temperature models may help issue earthquake forecasts. 'It’s an exciting direction, and we hope our study sheds some light on the bigger picture of what triggers earthquakes,' said Junqueira Saldanha.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevSV_2tUsKgkG	2025-03-04T15:03:59-08:00	
Breakthrough In Clean Energy: Palladium Nanosheets Pave Way For A...	Hydrogen energy is emerging as a key driver of a clean, sustainable future, offering a zero-emission alternative to fossil fuels. Although it is promising, the large-scale production of hydrogen relies heavily on expensive platinum-based catalysts, and hence affordability remains a major challenge for the industry. To surpass this, researchers from the Tokyo University of Science (TUS) have developed a novel hydrogen evolution catalyst, bis(diimino)palladium coordination nanosheets (PdDI), that offers platinum-like efficiency at a fraction of the cost. Their groundbreaking study, which was published in Volume 31, Issue 6 of Chemistry – A European Journal, has also been selected as a 'Cover Feature' for the journal, highlighting its significance in advancing sustainable hydrogen production. The study was led by Dr. Hiroaki Maeda and Professor Hiroshi Nishihara from TUS in collaboration with high-profiled researchers from the University of Tokyo, Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, Kyoto Institute of Technology, RIKEN SPring-8 Center, and the National Institute for Materials Science, Japan. The discovery marks a breakthrough in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) technology, which is a key process in green hydrogen energy generation. HER occurs in the process of electrolytic splitting of water for the generation of hydrogen. The HER catalyst electrodes, traditionally made of platinum, facilitate the conversion of nascent hydrogen ([H])—generated at the electrode surface during water splitting—into hydrogen gas (H₂). While platinum (Pt) as a HER catalyst is highly effective, its scarcity and high cost significantly increase manufacturing expenses, limiting its large-scale application. Using a simple synthesis process and limited amounts of precious metals, the research team offered a highly efficient alternative for Pt catalysts. The team fabricated palladium-based nanosheets that could maximize catalytic activity while minimizing metal usage, drastically lowering the costs associated with H₂ production. 'Developing efficient HER electrocatalysts is key to sustainable H₂ production. Bis(diimino)metal coordination nanosheets, with their high conductivity, large surface area, and efficient electron transfer, are promising candidates,' says lead researcher, Dr. Maeda. 'Additionally, their sparse metal arrangement reduces material usage. Here, we have successfully developed these nanosheets using palladium metal.' The team developed PdDI nanosheets (C-PdDI and E-PdDI) using two different methods: gas-liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation respectively. After undergoing the activation, the E-PdDI sheets exhibited a low overpotential of 34 mV as well as platinum’s overpotential of 35 mV, which meant that very little extra energy was required to drive the hydrogen production. The exchange current density of 2.1 mA/cm² also matched the platinum’s catalytic performance. The results therefore place E-PdDI among the most efficient HER catalysts developed to date, making it a promising low-cost alternative to platinum. One of the critical aspects of any catalyst is its long-term stability. These PdDI nanosheets demonstrated excellent durability, remaining intact after 12 hours in acidic conditions, confirming their suitability for real-world hydrogen production systems. 'Our research brings us one step closer to making H₂ production more affordable and sustainable, a crucial step for achieving a clean energy future,' explains Dr. Maeda. Furthermore, by minimizing the reliance on scarce and costly platinum, PdDI nanosheets align with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 7—promoting affordable and clean energy, SDG 9—industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The implications of this study extend beyond laboratory experiments. The scalability, enhanced activity, and cost-effectiveness of PdDI nanosheets make them highly attractive for industrial hydrogen production, hydrogen fuel cells, and large-scale energy storage systems. Additionally, replacing platinum-based catalysts with PdDI could reduce mining-related emissions, accelerating the transition to a sustainable hydrogen economy. Also, the density of palladium atoms is ten times lesser than Pt atoms, reducing the dependency on precious Pt metal, and approaching for a cost-effective production of electrodes. The replacement of Pt with PdDI nanosheets is expected to produce great outcomes in automobiles, hydrogen production, and electrode-supplying industries. As research progresses, the team at TUS aims to further optimize PdDI nanosheets for commercialization, contributing to the development of an environmentally friendly hydrogen society.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevbVeiPtDcMc_	2025-03-04T15:02:08-08:00	
TROPEX-2025: Strengthening India’s Maritime Resolve In The Indo-P...	In the face of evolving maritime challenges and the shifting dynamics of global geopolitics, India has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to securing the Indo-Pacific region through the successful execution of the Theatre Level Operational Readiness Exercise (TROPEX) 2025. This biennial exercise, conducted by the Indian Navy with active participation from the Indian Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard, is a testament to India's robust maritime capabilities, strategic foresight, and dedication to regional stability. A Comprehensive Display of Maritime Strength TROPEX-2025, spanning from January to March 2025, unfolded across the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The exercise encompassed harbour and sea phases, integrating various facets of combat operations, cyber and electronic warfare, live weapon firings, and amphibious exercises (AMPHEX). The scale of TROPEX-2025 was unprecedented, with approximately 65 Indian Naval ships, nine submarines, and over 80 aircraft participating in complex maritime operational scenarios. This extensive mobilisation aimed to validate and refine the Navy's Concept of Operations, emphasising forward-deployed sustenance and interoperability with other services. A highlight of the exercise was the deployment of India's indigenous aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, symbolising the nation's strides towards self-reliance in defence manufacturing. Accompanying INS Vikrant were state-of-the-art Visakhapatnam and Kolkata Class destroyers, Kalvari Class submarines, and an array of advanced aircraft, including the MiG-29K fighters, P-8I maritime patrol aircraft, HALE Sea Guardian drones, and MH-60R helicopters. The integration of these platforms showcased India's capability to orchestrate coordinated and precise maritime operations, reinforcing its position as a formidable naval power in the Indo-Pacific. Jointmanship and Interoperability: The Cornerstones of TROPEX-2025 The essence of TROPEX-2025 lies in its emphasis on jointmanship and seamless interoperability among the Indian Armed Forces. The exercise witnessed the convergence of assets from the Indian Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard, operating in unison to simulate real-world combat scenarios. The Indian Air Force contributed with Sukhoi-30 and Jaguar fighter aircraft, C-130 transport planes, flight refuellers, and AWACS aircraft, enhancing the exercise's aerial dimension. The Indian Army's involvement included an infantry brigade comprising over 600 troops, participating in amphibious landings and establishing beachheads, demonstrating the capability to effectively project power from sea to land. A significant event during TROPEX-2025 was the embarkation of senior military leadership, including the Vice Chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, aboard frontline naval ships such as INS Vikrant and INS Jalashwa. Their presence underscored the high level of coordination and the importance of integrated operations. These leaders witnessed dynamic operations, including missile firings, anti-submarine drills, and extensive flying operations by MiG-29K fighters and various helicopters, both day and night. Such high-level participation not only boosts the forces' morale but also signifies a unified strategic vision aimed at safeguarding India's maritime interests. Strategic Significance in the Indo-Pacific Context The Indo-Pacific region, a pivotal conduit for global trade and energy flows, has increasingly become a theatre of strategic competition. Emerging challenges, including assertive maritime claims and the militarisation of critical sea lanes, necessitate a proactive and prepared stance. TROPEX-2025 is a clear signal of India's resolve to maintain peace, stability, and the rule of law in these waters. The exercise's expansive scope, covering the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the broader Indian Ocean, reflects India's capability to monitor and secure critical maritime zones. By rigorously testing combat readiness through simulated warfare scenarios, anti-submarine operations, and amphibious landings, TROPEX-2025 ensures the Indian Navy remains poised to counter conventional, asymmetric, and hybrid threats. This readiness is crucial in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring regional partners of India's commitment to collective security. Countering China's Maritime Expansion: The Role of TROPEX in Power Projection China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has aggressively expanded its presence in the Indian Ocean, frequently deploying warships and intelligence-gathering vessels near territorial waters. The establishment of a PLA Navy base in Djibouti, strategic military agreements with Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and its expanding naval footprint in the Bay of Bengal through economic coercion tactics have raised serious security concerns for India. TROPEX 2025 sends a powerful message that India is not a passive bystander but a formidable force willing to challenge such incursions. The inclusion of offensive naval tactics, area denial strategies, and multi-theatre force deployment showcases India's preparedness to intercept, neutralise, and eliminate threats in its maritime domain.Moreover, by deepening naval cooperation with the Quad, ASEAN partners, and regional allies like France (which has strategic bases in the Indian Ocean), India is ensuring that the Indo-Pacific remains free from unilateral dominance. A Final Warning to Hostile Powers As the exercise concludes, one thing is clear: India will not tolerate maritime coercion, territorial incursions, or hegemonic ambitions that threaten its national security and regional stability. TROPEX 2025 cements India's position as the leading maritime force in the Indo-Pacific, ready to counter threats, protect vital sea lanes, and uphold the principles of freedom of navigation. For adversaries who seek to encroach upon India's maritime domain, TROPEX 2025 is a stark reminder that the Indian Navy is equipped, prepared, and determined to enforce its sovereign rights and strategic interests. Whether it is PLA naval vessels prowling in the Indian Ocean, Chinese spy ships attempting to gather intelligence near India's naval bases, or coercive debt-trap diplomacy seeking to encircle India's influence, none will go unchecked. With unmatched firepower, strategic alliances, and an unwavering commitment to regional peace, TROPEX 2025 is not just an exercise, it is a declaration. A declaration that India is a significant maritime power in the Indo-Pacific will not yield an inch of its rightful sphere of influence to any expansionist force. The seas belong to those who have the will to defend them, and India, through TROPEX 2025, India has made it abundantly clear: it will lead, protect, and prevail.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevcoUOrk3WyH_	2025-03-04T10:15:14-08:00	
Zelenskyy Says Oval Office Meeting Was ‘Regrettable’, Willing To ...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that the tense Oval Office meeting with US President Donald Trump last week was 'regrettable,' and that he is willing to work with Trump's 'strong leadership' to achieve long-term peace. Zelenskyy's remarks came in a social media post on X, hours after the White House announced a pause in military aid to Ukraine, which is critical to fighting Russia's invasion. 'The meeting did not go the way it was supposed to,' Zelenskyy said. 'It's unfortunate that it happened this way. It's time to make things right. We want future cooperation and communication to be constructive.' Saying that 'none of us want an endless war,' he added that 'Ukraine is ready to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring long-term peace closer...My team and I are ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to achieve long-term peace.' Zelenskyy thanked the US for its support during the war and said Kyiv was 'ready' to sign the US-proposed minerals deal, even though his remarks did not specifically address the US decision to halt aid to Ukraine. Late on March 3, senior US officials told multiple media outlets that Trump had ordered a pause in all military aid to Ukraine, piling pressure on Kyiv to fall in line with US efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia despite a lack of security guarantees for Ukraine. 'We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,' reports quoted a White House official as saying on condition of anonymity. 'The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well.' 'This is not permanent termination of aid, it's a pause,' Fox News quoted a Trump administration official as saying. The suspension will last until Trump determines that Ukraine's leaders demonstrate a good-faith commitment to peace, according to Bloomberg and Fox News. Speaking from Washington on March 4, US Vice President JD Vance spoke about the US decision to suspend military aid. Vance said the US needs to 'get some payback for the incredible financial investment' it has made in Ukraine. When asked if the US would resume providing military aid to Ukraine, Vance says that 'everything is on the table' once Kyiv begins negotiating. What Are The Chances Of A Reversal? Reports of the suspension widened the rift between Zelenskyy and the Trump administration, which had long been troubled but split wide open at the White House meeting. The pause amplifies already deafening questions about US support for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion at a time when Moscow's forces have been gaining ground for many months, albeit at a massive cost in casualties, and Ukraine struggles with manpower problems and other challenges in the biggest war in Europe since 1945. It is likely to add to concerns in Kyiv and among its supporters in the West that Ukraine could be pressured into a cease-fire or a peace deal that favors Moscow. Those worries increased after Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin in mid-February and then sent top officials to meet their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. The Kremlin welcomed the news. 'If it’s true, then it’s a decision that really could push the Kyiv regime into a peace process,' Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'If the United States stops being [an arms supplier] or suspends these supplies, it will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,' he said. Any disruption in the flow of US arms to the front line would rapidly weaken Ukraine's chance of beating back Russia's invasion. The suspension applies to 'all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit on aircraft and ships or waiting in transit areas in Poland,' Bloomberg reported. 'The suspension of U.S. assistance for Ukraine is a very unfortunate and significant development, but it may not have immediate impact,' Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an expert on the Ukrainian and Russian militaries, wrote in a thread on X. 'Ukraine is far less dependent on the U.S. for day to day battlefield needs in 2025, than it was in earlier periods of the war. ' 'Much depends on the extent [to which] Ukraine has been stockpiling munitions/parts and where Europeans can step in, although in some cases they have low inventories, and in others U.S. retains the ability to deny any transfers,' Kofman wrote. 'The impact will probably be much more visible in a few months. The pause 'will have a bad impact, of course, if you deprive Ukraine of assistance from the United States, whether it's financial aid or military aid,' independent military analyst Yury Federov told Current Time. 'Military assistance includes not only supplying weapons, ammunition and so on, but it also includes supporting Ukraine by providing intelligence information.' 'Most experts estimate that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be able to maintain the current pace and intensity of military operations for about six months,' he said. 'Whether this is correct or not is difficult to say.' How Much Aid Is Affected? The precise amount of military aid affected is unclear, but the transfer of $3.85 billion worth of weapons authorized by Congress under Biden had not yet been allocated by the White House. No new military aid has been approved since Trump took office in January. The US Congress has appropriated more than $180 billion in support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, about two-thirds of it military aid. 'First of all, the suspension of US aid could affect air defense missiles, HIMARS ammunition, and artillery,' Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko wrote on Telegram. The United States is the only producer of HIMARS and ATACMS systems and if they run out, Ukraine's ability to strike far behind Russian lines and guard its rear positions will be compromised. Ukrainian politicians voiced dismay at the decision and concern over the tattered ties between Kyiv and Washington. 'The dialogue with the United States must be restored immediately, because its rupture will, by and large, benefit only Putin,' Iryna Friz, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity bloc in Ukraine's parliament and member of the Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. Friz pointed out that European leaders have also urged Zelenskyy to seek to mend relations with the Trump administration. Roman Kostenko, secretary of the same committee in the Verkhovna Rada, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that the United States was 'blackmailing us with these weapons and trying to make us make some concessions.' The situation is 'very bad, but not catastrophic,' he said. 'Even if we lose this assistance, there will be no catastrophe, but the situation, of course, will be much worse. Therefore, now we all have to do everything in order not to lose assistance.' Prominent Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said the current US policy on Ukraine, dramatically different from the Biden administration’s stance, is part of 'the new political reality.' 'But tactically, we need to preserve the remnants of the partnership and the ability to buy weapons from the United States and receive intelligence and satellite information,' he told Current Time. Fesenko called for changes in Kyiv’s approach to US ties, including 'a refusal to bet on personal contacts between Zelenskyy and Trump. 'This has been Zelenskyy's premise from the very beginning, that the most important thing is his personal relationship with Trump, he said. 'And what did we see? Unfortunately, it didn't work.' In the United States, Democrats in Congress immediately condemned the pause in military aid. 'My Republican colleagues who have called Putin a war criminal and promised their continued support to Ukraine must join me in demanding President Trump immediately lift this disastrous and unlawful freeze,' said Representative Gregory Meeks (Democrat-New York). The military aid pause came after Zelenskyy's disastrous visit to the White House, which had been expected to produce a deal on joint development of Ukrainian rare minerals and hydrocarbon resources that Trump has cast as a crucial step toward peace between Ukraine and Russia. Instead, a meeting before cameras in the Oval Office devolved into a vocal clash, with Trump and Vance saying that Zelenskyy should be more grateful for US support and is in no position to make demands. The signing of the minerals deal was scrapped, Zelenskyy left the White House early, and Trump said he could 'come back when he is ready for peace.' Senior US officials blamed Zelenskyy for the blowup and called on him to apologize. On March 3, Trump suggested his patience was running out, criticizing Zelenskyy's resistance to the prospect of a quick cease-fire without the kind of concrete security guarantees Kyiv has been seeking from the United States. What Could End The Military Aid Pause? 'What we need to hear from President Zelenskyy is that he has regret for what happened, he's ready to sign this minerals deal, and that he's ready to engage in peace talks,' White House national-security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News earlier on March 3. After Zelenskyy was quoted as saying the end of the war is 'very, very far away,' Trump wrote in a social media post: 'This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!' In the Fox interview, Vance said that the door remains open to the Ukrainians, but that European leaders must tell Zelenskyy that the war can’t go on forever. He said they admit this in private but in public tend to 'puff' Zelenskyy up. He also defended Trump's position that giving Washington an economic interest in the future of Ukraine will serve as a sound security guarantee. 'If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,' Vance said in the interview. 'That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years,' he added. Trump said on March 3 that he does not believe the minerals deal is dead. With US support deeper in doubt after the Oval Office clash, European leaders moved to take more control of potential peace negotiations and to step up military aid to Ukraine. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 3 that there were a 'number of options on the table' for a cease-fire agreement to at least temporarily halt fighting sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago. The statement came after French President Emmanuel Macron told the newspaper Le Figaro that he thought a one-month truce on air, sea, and energy infrastructure would give allies time to assess Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to a full and lasting cease-fire. 'Manufactured Escalation,' Says Germany's Merz Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is proposing a 'rearm Europe plan' as European governments scramble to mitigate their growing differences with the United States over the war in Ukraine. 'We need a massive surge in defense, without any question. We want lasting peace, but lasting peace can only be built on strength, and strength begins with strengthening ourselves,' von der Leyen said on March 3. In a letter to EU member states on March 4, she proposed that 800 billion euros ($840 billion) be made available for European defense spending going forward, with 150 billion ($157 billion) euros in new loans for defense investments to be backed by the EU's budget. In some of the strongest European comments yet on the White House standoff, Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, referred to what he called 'manufactured escalation' at the meeting, a thinly veiled criticism of Trump and his administration. 'It was not a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but obviously a manufactured escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,' Merz told a news conference in Hamburg on March 3, adding that Europe 'must now show that we are in a position to act independently.' Despite intense and ongoing discussions on boosting Europe's own defense capacities and alarm over warming rhetoric between Moscow and Washington, European leaders say engaging the new US administration is a priority. Merz said he would 'advocate doing everything to keep the Americans in Europe.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevX1-hlTYelyI	2025-03-04T10:13:40-08:00	
Reality Confronts The Euro Ruling-Strata: ‘Through The Tear In Th...	They (the Euro-élites) don’t have a chance: 'If Trump imposes this tariff [25%], the U.S. will be in a serious trade conflict with the EU', the Norwegian Prime Minister threatens. And what if Brussels does retaliate? 'They can try, but they can’t', Trump responded. Von der Leyen has, however, already promised that she will retaliate. Nonetheless, the combined suite of the Anglo administrative forces is still unlikely to compel Trump to put U.S. military troops on the ground in Ukraine to protect European interests (and investments!). The reality is that every European NATO member – to varying degrees of self-embarrassment – admits publicly now that none of them want to participate in securing Ukraine without having U.S. military troops provide ‘backstop’ to those European forces. This is a palpably obvious scheme to inveigle Trump into continuing the Ukraine war – as is Macron and Starmer’s dangling of the mineral deal to try to trick Trump to recommit to the Ukraine war. Trump plainly sees through these ploys. The fly in the ointment, however, is that Zelensky seemingly fears a ceasefire, more than he fears losing further ground on the battlefield. He too, seems to need the war to continue (to preserve continuing in power, possibly). Trump calling time on the Ukraine war that has been lost has seemingly caused European elites to enter some form of cognitive dissonance. Of course, it has been clear for some time that Ukraine would not retake its 1991 borders, nor force Russia into a negotiating position weak enough for the West to be able to dictate its own cessation terms. As Adam Collingwood writes: 'Trump has torn a huge rip in the interface layer of the fantasy bubble … the governing élite [in the wake of Trump’s pivot] can see not just an electoral setback, but rather a literal catastrophe. A defeat in war, with [Europe] left largely defenceless; a de-industrialising economy; crumbling public services and infrastructure; large fiscal deficits; stagnating living standards; social and ethnic disharmony – and a powerful populist insurgency led by enemies just as grave as Trump and Putin in the Manichean struggle against vestiges of liberal times – and strategically sandwiched between two leaders that both despise and disdain them …'. 'In other words, through the tear in the fantasy bubble, Europe’s elites see their own demise …'. 'Anybody who could see reality knew that things would only get worse on the war front from autumn 2023, but from their fantasy bubble, our élites couldn’t see it. Vladimir Putin, like the ‘Deplorables’ and ‘Gammons’ at home, was an atavistic daemon who would inevitably be slain on the inexorable march to liberal progressive utopia'. Many in the Euro ruling-strata clearly are furious. Yet what can Britain or Germany actually do? It has quickly become clear that European states do not have the military capacity to intervene in Ukraine in any concerted manner. But more than anything, as Conor Gallagher points out, it is the European economy, circling the drain – largely as a result of the war against Russia – that is dragging reality to the forefront. The new German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has shown himself to be the most implacable European leader advocating both military expansion and youth conscription – in what amounts to an European resistance model mounted to confront Trump’s pivot to Russia. Yet Merz’s winning CDU/CSU achieved only 28% of votes cast, whilst losing significant voter share. Hardly an outstanding mandate for confronting both Russia – and America – together! 'I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of EU states and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the U.S., step by step', Friedrich Merz said. Second place in the German election was taken by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 20% of the national vote. The party was the top vote getter in the 25-45 year-old demographic. It supports good relations with Russia, an end to the Ukraine war, and it wants to work with Team Trump, too. Yet AfD absurdly is outcast under the ‘firewall rules’. As a ‘populist’ party with a strong youth vote, it becomes automatically relegated to the ‘wrong side’ of the EU firewall. Merz has already refused to share power with them, leaving the CDU as pig-in-the-middle, squeezed between the failing SPD, which lost the most voter share, and the AfD and Der Linke, another firewall outcast, which, like AfD, gained voter share, especially among the under-45s. The rub here – and it is a big one – is that the AfD and the Left Party, Der Linke (8.8%), which was the top vote getter in the 18-24 demographic, are both anti-war. Together these two have more than one third of the votes in parliament – a blocking minority for many important votes, especially for constitutional changes. This will be a big headache for Merz, as Wolfgang Münchau explains: 'For one thing, the new Chancellor had wanted to travel to the NATO summit this June, with a strong commitment to higher defence spending. And even though the Left Party and the AfD hate each other in every other respect, they agree that they won’t give Merz the money to strengthen the Bundeswehr. More important, though, is the fact that they won’t support a reform to the constitutional fiscal rules (the debt brake) that Merz and the SPD are desperate for'. The Rules are complicated, but in gist dictate that if Germany wants to spend more money on defence and aid to Ukraine, it had to be saved from elsewhere in the budget (most likely from social spending). But politically, saving on social spending to pay for Ukraine hasn’t played well with the German electorate. The last coalition failed on precisely this issue. Even with the Greens, Merz still will be short of the two-thirds majority necessary to make constitutional changes, and the ‘Centre’ just doesn’t have the fiscal space for challenging Russia without U.S. funding. Von der Leyen will try to ‘magic’ money for defence from somewhere, 'but German youth are voting against the Establishment parties who are hated. They can build a few Leopards if they want. They won’t get recruits'. Whilst the EU and Britain are proposing to raise billions to arm themselves against some imaginary Russian invasion, it will be done against the backdrop of Trump saying explicitly – on the threat of a Russian invasion of NATO – 'I don’t believe that; I don’t believe it, not one little bit'. Another Euro-shibboleth ripped by Trump. Thus, how will the European public, which has largely soured on the Ukraine war, react to higher energy costs and more tax and social service cuts, in order to pursue an unwinnable war in Ukraine? Starmer already has been warned that the (government debt) ‘bond vigilantes’ will react badly to yet more UK government debt as the fiscal situation wobbles precariously. There are no obvious solutions to Europe’s current predicament: It is, on one hand, an existential conundrum for Merz. And on the other, it is the same one that dogs the EU as a whole: To get anything done, a parliamentary majority is a basic necessity. The ‘firewall’, though primordially intended to protect the ‘Centrists’ in Brussels from Rightist ‘populists’, was subsequently turbo-charged in Brussels by Biden’s issuing of a foreign policy determination to all U.S. foreign policy ‘actors’ to the effect that populism was a ‘threat to democracy’ and must be contested. The practical outcome however, has been that across the EU, blocking coalitions were formed of odd (minority party) bed-fellows agreeing to keep the Centrists in power, but which rather has led to endless stasis and an ever increasing detachment from ‘we, the people’. Angela Merkel governed in this way, kicking the can of reform down the road for years – until the situation ultimately became (and still is) insoluble. 'Can another coalition of short-sighted centrists arrest the decline of the economy, fix the failure of leadership, and free the nation from its pernicious political trap? I think we know the answer', writes Wolfgang Münchau. There lies a bigger problem however: As Vance very explicitly warned at the recent Munich Security Forum, Europe’s enemy lies not with Russia; It lies within. It derives, Vance implied, from the fact of having a permanent bureaucracy, assuming to itself the exclusive prerogative of autonomous governing power, yet incrementally becoming ever-more remote from its own base. Tear down the firewalls, Vance advocated, in order to return to the (abandoned) principles of that earlier democracy originally shared between the U.S. and Europe. Implicitly, Vance is targeting the Brussels Administrative (Deep) State. The Eurocrats see in this new front an alternate American-supported attack on their Administrative State – and perceive therein their own demise. In the U.S., there is acknowledgement that there is an 'institutional resistance to Trump' in the DOD, DOJ and the FBI. It proves, Margot Cleveland argues, that those touting the need for 'institutional resistance' and the supposed independence from the executive branch, are the opponents to democracy – and to Trump. Given the close nexus between the U.S., the British and European Deep States, the question arises as to why there is such strong parallel resistance to Trump amongst European leaders also. Ostensibly, it is not in Europe’s interest to mount a concerted resistance against the U.S. President over a failed war. Is the European frenzy then fuelled by a wider (U.S.) Deep State desire to neuter the ‘Trump Revolution’ by demonstrating, in addition to the U.S. domestic opposition at home, that Trump is causing havoc amongst the U.S.’ European allies? Is Europe being pushed further down this path than they would otherwise have chosen to venture? For Germany to change course – albeit unthinkable for Merz – it would require only a minimal amount of imagination to envision Germany again linked to Eurasia. The AfD gained 20% of the vote on just such a platform. Really, there probably is little other option.

The Broken Trough: Trump’s Geopolitical Gamble And Its Consequenc...	Donald Trump’s presidency has ushered in a seismic shift in the geopolitical landscape, challenging the foundational perceptions Americans have held for generations. Since at least 1939, the United States has viewed the Soviet Union as an adversary, a rivalry rooted in ideological and strategic differences. The U.S. never recognized the Soviet annexation of the Baltic republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—as legitimate, reflecting a belief that the people of these nations did not willingly submit to Moscow’s rule. During World War II, the U.S. and the Soviet Union briefly aligned against the Axis powers, but this alliance unraveled shortly after victory, giving way to the Cold War. The Cold War saw the West and the Soviet Union, later transitioning into an authoritarian Russia, locked in a geopolitical rivalry punctuated by proxy conflicts across the globe. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point, scattering its republics into economic and social chaos. Western leaders, however, squandered this opportunity. Rather than swiftly integrating the former Soviet states into NATO’s protective umbrella, they hesitated, leaving a power vacuum that Russia would later exploit. Ukraine, arguably the most critical piece of the post-Soviet puzzle, remained outside the West’s orbit. To decisively dismantle the Soviet empire, absorbing Ukraine into the Western economic and political sphere was essential— without it, the notion of a Russian empire cannot truly endure. Yet the West, intoxicated by the Soviet collapse, underestimated Russia’s resilience. Fueled by soaring oil and gas revenues, the Russian Federation recovered with surprising speed, embarking on a mission to reassemble its lost dominion. Ukraine emerged as both a buffer zone for the West and a coveted prize, a linchpin in Russia’s imperial ambitions. The history has shaped generations of Russians who despise Western values, particularly those espoused by the United States. Russian culture mocks Americans as dim-witted and uncouth, coining the slur 'pindos' to encapsulate this scorn. Europe is dismissed as 'Gayropa,' a jab blending 'gay' and 'Evropa' to deride its liberalism. The war in Ukraine, launched in 2014, encapsulates this hostility. It is not a mere territorial dispute but a punitive campaign to subjugate Ukraine and erase its sovereignty. Russia stands as the unambiguous aggressor, while Ukraine fights for its survival as an independent nation. Previous U.S. administrations grasped this dynamic, though their responses often fell short. The Biden administration, for instance, provided military aid to Ukraine—enough to stave off collapse but insufficient to expel Russian forces. The result has been a brutal stalemate, now stretching into its third year, with neither side gaining decisive ground. Ukraine has become a relentless meat grinder for Russian troops, forcing Moscow to conscript North Korean soldiers, whom Ukrainian forces have systematically eliminated. Then comes Trump, whose stance defies decades of American foreign policy. For reasons unclear, he harbors disdain for Ukraine and an affinity for Putin’s strongman persona. He has muted criticism of Russia while flinging baseless accusations at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him a dictator, a mediocre comedian, and a leader with a fabricated 4% approval rating. These were falsehoods, and many Republicans countered that Putin, not Zelenskyy, fits the dictator mold. As for the comedian label, Zelenskyy was regarded as one of the greatest entertainers in the entire post-Soviet space, not just Ukraine. Trump’s retort—that he never said such things—drew a wry nod to his MAGA — 'Make Amnesia Great Again' playbook, a jest at his penchant for rewriting his own words. His team has pushed a narrative of excessive U.S. spending on Ukraine, tossing out inflated figures like $350 billion or $500 billion, which are significantly higher than the amounts reported by the Pentagon and Ukrainian officials. In reality, U.S. support has been far more modest, and even at its highest estimates, it represents a bargain when weighed against the strategic goal of weakening a geopolitical rival. No American lives have been lost, much of the aid consists of outdated equipment slated for disposal, and a portion of the funds has bolstered the U.S. military through the production of new equipment. Yet Trump appears unswayed by this logic. He does not view Russia as an adversary, a stance that upends the post-1939 American worldview. His demand that Ukraine repay U.S. aid—a notion unsupported by any formal agreement—borders on the absurd. Why single out Ukraine, a nation locked in an existential struggle, when no such demands have been made of Iraq, Kuwait, or Afghanistan? Trump has cast himself as the 'Peacemaker-in-Chief,' insisting that both he and Russia desire peace. But his version of peace translates to a Russian victory, a capitulation that would reward aggression. This position clashes with a core tenet of American identity—enshrined in folklore, literature, comics, and films—where justice, the defense of the weak, and resistance to bullies reign supreme. Heroes like Captain America and Spider-Man embody this ethos, a cultural thread Trump’s policies unravel by siding with the oppressor. The fallout from Trump’s stance is unfolding in real time. His administration’s recent conduct—most notably the disgusting denigration of Zelenskyy during a meeting in the Oval Office—has left it scrambling to contain the damage. Claims that Zelenskyy was rude ring hollow against the backdrop of European leaders and unbiased observers who see Trump’s and Vance’s behavior as indefensible. This episode evokes a cautionary tale from Russian literature—Alexander Pushkin’s The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish. In it, an old woman’s insatiable greed leads her to demand mastery over the sea from a magical fish, only to find herself returned to poverty, staring at a broken trough. Trump, in his quest to play a 'world peacemaker' and tilt the geopolitical board toward Russia, has arrived at a similar fate. His administration sits amidst the wreckage of its own making, its credibility fractured. The administration’s promises of mineral deals, aid repayment, and future contracts have evaporated at least temporarily. Europe has rallied more firmly behind Ukraine, increasingly skeptical of America’s reliability as a global leader. The much-touted 'peace in 24 hours' has proven an empty boast, a punchline rather than a policy. The U.S. economy stumbles—Q1 GDP projections for 2025 have shrunk to -2.8%—and Trump’s tariff threats have failed to cow nations into submission. His conduct has estranged allies, and cozying up to Russia, a nation that loathes the U.S. to its core, strains credulity. Ukraine persists, its anthem defiantly proclaiming 'not dead yet,' though the path ahead is brutal. Every civilian death would mount a charge against Trump, who has withheld critical aid like Patriot missiles, tainting his image further. He placed the demand for an apology on one scale and the deaths of people fighting for their way of life on the other. Ukraine’s fight is not just for its own survival but for the principles that once defined American leadership—freedom, sovereignty, and resistance to tyranny. Trump’s pivot toward Russia threatens to rewrite this narrative, casting the U.S. as a bystander or worse, an enabler. The optics are dire, and Republican senators and congressmen may begin to distance themselves, unwilling to tether their political futures to this sinking ship. This rift foreshadows political peril. The Senate and House may slip from Trump’s grasp, echoing the impeachments of his first term. All of this could have been sidestepped had he confronted Russia alongside a united Western front. Instead, he chased a mirage of peace on Putin’s terms, landing at that broken trough. The broader implications are stark: the United States risks ceding its moral and strategic standing—a legacy built over generations—to a vision that elevates personal whims over principled policy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevcu88VfW9QRY	2025-03-04T10:08:43-08:00	
How Mesopotamia’s Urban And Industrial Revolution Started Politic...	Giorgio Buccellati's At the Origins of Politics takes readers to the early stages of a process that became the structure of modern life Archaeologist and scholar Giorgio Buccellati's book At the Origins of Politics describes how Mesopotamia's urban revolution in the late fourth millennium BC shaped a new mentality. The segmentation and specialization of industrial production required written recordkeeping, standardization of weights and measures, and surveying and allocation of land planning. This inherent logic of handicraft production and its related organization of trade and market exchange, especially with the palace and temple institutions, led to new forms of social interaction, with the state and its laws and religion consolidating the new managerial hierarchies. I met Buccellati in 1994 at the first of what would become a decade-long series of Harvard-based colloquia to compile an economic history of the Bronze Age Near Eastern origins of money and interest, land tenure, and its public obligations. Since these innovations were shaped largely by relations with the temples and palaces, our group started by focusing on just what it meant to be public or private. It was fairly clear what 'privatization' meant, but calling the palace or temples 'public' was problematic. Royal price schedules for grain, silver, and other key commodities applied only to transactions with these large institutions, which were corporately distinct from the rest of the economy where prices were free to vary. Hammurabi's laws focused on the relations between the palatial sector and the family-based economy on the land, which followed its own common law tradition for wergild-like personal offenses and other legal problems not involving the palace. How far beyond the palace did the state extend? Buccellati's paper focused on a broader philosophical idea of 'public' as referring to the overall system of social and economic organization: 'The dichotomy between public and private is coterminous with the origin of the city.'1 As he points out in At the Origins of Politics: 'The increased size of the settlements created a critical mass, whereby face-to-face association no longer was possible among each member of the social group.' The relationship was political. 'On the etymological level, the terms 'urbanism' and 'politics' are equivalent, given that they both derive from the word for 'city' in Latin and Greek respectively.' His term 'state-city' emphasizes the overall political and administrative context. He views industrialization as the economic dimension of the urban revolution that occurred in the late fourth millennium BC. The scale and social complexity of mining (or trading for metal) and metallurgy, beer-making, and weaving involved increasingly impersonal relationships as industrial organizations created products beyond the ability of individuals to make by themselves. The evolution was from direct personal contact to being part of a long, specialized chain. Describing this takeoff as the first Axial Age, Buccellati explains how economic and social relations had been transformed over the 50,000-year evolution from small Paleolithic groups to urban industrial production, trade, and property relations. The technology and administration of production transformed the character of labor and what Buccellati calls para-perceptual thought. The moral principles of mutual aid, group solidarity, protection of the needy, and basic rights to means of self-support were retained from pre-urban practice but were administered on the state level. 'The state was never able to eliminate or even ignore the people... political ideology became a way for the leadership to justify itself in front of the base,' bolstered by religious attitudes to popularize an 'Ideology of Control... the ideology of command, of leadership not necessarily based on coercive means.' Even in the face of 'ever-increasing gaps in prestige and economic ability,' the rhetoric of kingship promoted 'a sense of solidarity that transcends the limit of reciprocal face-to-face recognition.' For the king, the aim was to make 'submission not just tolerable but actually desirable.' That enabled Mesopotamian rule to be personal and indeed dynastic. 'The king was not just the most powerful private individual; he embodied a distinct organism.' Kings were described as serving heaven, as reflected in Hammurapi's stele depicting him presenting his laws to the god of justice, Shamash (or in some interpretations, receiving them from Shamash). 'The private model was thus superimposed from scratch on the public one,' merging the state and religion as every new king pointed to his ancestors as if this meant continuity of the law. The principle of kings being hereditary was accepted 'without ever being formulated in theoretical terms.' From Living in a State of Nature to a Stratified Managerial Order Buccellati describes production as evolving from interpersonal and small scale to institutional and large scale. He describes how Paleolithic hunters and gatherers met their needs by using what they found in nature. They napped flints to make spear points and cutting tools, and wove plant fibers to make clothing, baskets, and other artifacts, but these materials were as they found them. And personal wealth took the form of shells or other objects found in nature. However, the increasing complexity of industrial organization transformed the character of producers in that they ceased to have face-to-face relations with the users of the objects they made. Products evolved increasingly beyond objects found in nature, and also beyond the ability of single individuals to make them as they required chains of transformation via metallurgy and manufacturing. Although Buccellati does not focus on land tenure, money, and credit in this volume, his analytic schema of the transition from 'nature' to man-made institutional structures suggests how land and credit relations evolved along similar lines, from informal and spontaneous to formal and standardized. If there was an archaic relationship with the land, it was for an Indigenous tribe to claim territory as belonging to itself for hunting and gathering and for ceremonial or religious functions. Most exchange was domestic, taking the form of reciprocal gifts, often of the same food types simply as a means of binding groups together in the spirit of mutual aid. But artifacts were traded among Indigenous communities already in the Ice Age, from one tribal group to another, sometimes passed along over long distances. Gathering places for such exchange existed already in the Ice Age, often at river crossings or natural meeting points. These would have been seasonal sites, with chieftains responsible for keeping the lunisolar calendar to time when to travel to such spots. If anything, such gathering places were the opposite of the later city that Buccellati describes. The idea was to prevent any one group from dominating others or restricting territorial control. The result was akin to the amphictyonic centers of classical antiquity, neutral zones set aside from political cities and rivalries, with careful equality of participants as a condition for amicable relations. Deities often were trees, woods, or natural rock formations such as those that survived in Germanic religion into the first millennium of our era, and Japan's Shinto religion. Lunar and solar deities were part of an astronomical cosmology reflecting the rhythms of nature. By the Bronze Age, gods took on the role of patrons of social authority and justice as urbanization transformed the natural environment. Technology enabled the production of new shapes and 'artifacts that have no analogy in nature.' Mud bricks became standardized to build walls. 'Stone is no longer seen as an adaptation of pre-existing forms' but was shaped to produce new building structures. Fire played an important role in controlling the environment, not only to cook food but also to bake mud bricks and harden ceramics, and to refine metal from ores and make alloys such as bronze to produce tools, weapons, and other implements. The potter's wheel and spindles for weaving were developed, and a managerial class came into being as manufacturing such products required increasingly complex organization, from producers and traders to armies. The Neolithic agricultural revolution saw the standardization of land, allotted to community members in lots sufficient to support their families, with proportional obligations attached—obliging their holders to serve in the army and provide seasonal corvée labor on communal building projects. These obligations were what defined land tenure rights. That created a strict relationship with the emerging urban centers that transformed 'the village as it existed in prehistory... in the sense of autonomous villages that found an end in themselves. ... Agricultural or manufactured production did not have as its end point the village, but rather and especially the urban markets.' Rural villages became part of the city, and local conflicts were settled by traveling urban judges. Monetization of Exchange Between the Rural and Urban Centers Money evolved as part of the valuation dimension of exchange. Anthropologists studying surviving Indigenous communities have found that artifacts typically are valued for their rarity or lineage of ownership. In archaic times such objects were often buried with their wearers, having become part of their personal identity. In time, they took a proto-monetary signification of esteem. But it was in southern Mesopotamia that money became formalized as a measure of valuation, simultaneously for domestic agrarian and industrial exchange—mainly for grain and wool—and for foreign trade. In both cases, the palace and temples played a key role. A standardized measure of value was needed for the economy's own industrial and institutional functioning, not merely for personal decoration and status. Foreign trade was necessary to obtain raw materials not found in the region's river-deposited soil. Copper and tin were the key metals that were needed, the alloy of which gave its name to the Bronze Age (3500-1200 BC), but silver was adopted as the main measure of value for palace transactions and those of entrepreneurs, presumably because of its role in religious symbolism. Silver and other commodities were obtained by a mercantile class of entrepreneurs, whose major customers were the palace and temples, which also supplied most of the textiles being exported. The largest categories of debts and fiscal obligations were inter-sectoral, owed by citizens on the land and mercantile entrepreneurs to the palace sector and its temples. The seasonal character of agriculture made credit necessary to bridge the gap between planting and harvesting, to be paid on the threshing floor when the crop was in. Grain served as the main domestic agrarian measure of value and the medium for paying agrarian debts. The palace and temples integrated their economic accounts by setting the silver mina and shekel that denominated the value of commodities obtained in foreign trade (and consignments of what was exchanged for them) as equal to corresponding measures of grain, while dividing the relevant measures into 60ths to facilitate the allocation of food and raw materials based on the 30-day administrative month used by the large institutions. The resulting monetary system of account-keeping for credit and fiscal collection was part of a broader economic context in which standardized weights and measures were used to quantify and calculate the various magnitudes of the inputs required by the large institutions for producing commodities in their workshops, along with the amounts of the charges, fees, and rents payable to the institutions and fiscal collectors. The surplus grain rent paid to the large institutions supported dependent labor in the weaving and handicraft workshops. Commodities no longer were made by individual craftpersons known to the users, but by many, whose identities were institutional and hence collective and impersonal as far as the buyers or users were concerned. The workforce consisted largely of war widows and orphans, and also slaves captured from the mountains surrounding Mesopotamia. (A typical word for slave was 'mountain girl.') The textiles woven by this labor were consigned to merchants to act as intermediaries between the large institutions or the growing class of private estate holders and foreign purchasers. Interest charges (usually equal to the original loan value for consignments of five years) served as a means for consigners and backers to obtain their share of the gain that merchants were expected to make on their trade. Bucellati shows how the urban revolution's 'evolutionary process in motion' to transform society and with it 'the very nature of human existence.' The development of writing, for instance, had a deep effect in transforming thought processes, much as the creation of languages had served to 'externalize thought.' It enabled the communication of ideas to others without having to rely on memory. Originally used by the eighth millennium BC to oversee and quantify trade and exchange transactions, it came to be used for accounting and credit, and increasingly to preserve, arrange and order thoughts, public announcements, treaties, poetry, and laws. The written word became a new medium for thought. Buccellati describes this 'reification of thought' as part of the 'removal from nature.' That was part of the evolving uniformity that spread from the production of commodities to shape the overall social order. Debt Strains Lead Rulers to Protect Their Economies From Polarizing Industry and entrepreneurial foreign trade concentrated control and wealth in the hands of managers and 'big men.' Their economic gains caused a wealthy class to emerge, initially within the large institutions, with credit being used to pry labor away from palace control. Creditor claims on indebted cultivators accumulated, largely at the institutional level of landholders, merchant-creditors, and also ale-women, whose customers ran up tabs for their beer, to be settled at 'payday' on the threshing floor when crops were harvested. It was inevitable that strains would develop as a result of the rising role of credit and debt relations, especially in times of flooding or crop failure. As rent and other payment arrears and interest charges mounted up, private lending (often by royal or temple officials acting on their own account) became the major initial way to obtain the labor of debtors, by requiring them to work off their debts. That prevented cultivators from performing the stipulated corvée and military service that they owed in exchange for their land tenure rights. The result was a threefold conflict: first, creditors against debtors; second, creditors against the palace over the appropriation of labor via debt bondage; and third, the assertion of creditor power against traditional communal moral ideas of equity and mutual aid. Archaic communities traditionally sought to minimize economic inequality, perceiving much personal wealth as being achieved by exploiting others, above all by indebting them. By the third millennium, indebted cultivators faced the threat of being disenfranchised, losing their personal freedom and self-support land through foreclosure. As Buccellati observed in our 1994 colloquium royal protection of homesteaders, canceling the overgrowth of personal debt resulted 'more from a concern for the public domain than as a phenomenon of privatization.' Rulers from the third millennium BC onward protected palace claims on the labor of their citizens from being disrupted by debt strains of the type to which subsequent Western civilization has succumbed. Sumerian rulers made sure that these strains would not be permanent because that would have been at the expense of the palace's own requirements for corvée and military service from agrarian debtors. Buccellati pertinently notes that three main considerations shaped Near Eastern public laws: 'the concept of rules, the sense of justice, [and] the decisive moments in resolving conflict.' Hammurapi's 'code' was simply a collection of judgments, but his andurarum proclamations were enforced by the courts to cancel personal debts (but not mercantile debts), liberate bondservants (but not slaves), and redistribute self-support land (but not townhouses) that had been forfeited to creditors or sold under economic duress. These Clean Slates were the most basic royal administrative acts of Mesopotamian rulers from Sumerian times onward. They were the moral pillar of the state. The Mesopotamian State Solved the Debt Problem That Western Civilization Has Not Buccellati sees the transformation of production, economic control, and ways of perceiving and thinking about one's place in society as progressing toward a geopolitical peak with the Assyrian Empire. What enabled and made this sustained achievement so successful were royal laws to regularly restore economic balance on a system-wide level. Clean Slate proclamations prevented a creditor oligarchy from emerging to rival palace claims on the labor and crop surpluses of citizens on the land. In this respect, the distinction between financial and industrial gain-seeking—and the socially destructive character of usury and creditor self-interest—was recognized already in the third millennium BC in the Hymn to Shamash, the Akkadian god of justice (lines 103-106): What happens to the loan shark who invests his resources at the (highest) interest rate? He will lose his purse just as he tries to get the most out of it. But he who invests in the long term will convert one measure of silver into three. He pleases Shamash and will enrich his life.2 Buccellati rightly states that 'We are the heirs of Mesopotamian perception and political experience.' Modern civilization, however, has retrogressed from the Bronze Age Mesopotamian achievement of avoiding deepening financial and economic imbalance. He notes that modern society defines property as being alienable, but in the West securing property rights always has entailed the 'right' to forfeit it to creditors or sell under duress—irreversibly. That has been the case ever since Near Eastern commercial and credit practices were brought to the Aegean and Mediterranean lands in the first millennium BC. The West has adopted the basic economic practices invented in the fourth and third millennia BC, but not the economically protective measures that rulers took to annul the buildup of creditor claims to reverse the increase in debt bondage and loss of land by debtors. That decontextualization is what in my view makes the West 'Western.' Bronze Age Near Eastern practice was so different from the Western worldview that most modern historians resist recognizing and appreciating the relevance of the region's takeoff in the fourth and third millennia BC. Indeed, today's anti-state economic ideology denies that money and industrial enterprise could have been innovated by what Buccellati calls the state, that is, the palatial authority. This ideology obscures a great question posed for the West: How is it that Near Eastern 'divine kingship' achieved what Western democracy has failed to do: check the emergence of a creditor rent-seeking oligarchy, which in classical antiquity would strip the Greek, Italian, and other populations of their means of self-support that had formed the basis of economic liberty for the first 3,000 years of the Mesopotamian takeoff that this book so comprehensively describes.

Righteous, Confused And Unwilling: Europe’s Ukrainian Predicament...	There is something deeply moving about the ignorance and scatty nature of politicians. At points, it can even be endearing. In the apparently wide wake left by the mauling of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in front of the press at the Oval Office on February 28, backers of Kyiv’s war effort were wondering: What next? How do we prevent Ukrainian defeat at the hands of Russia? Having irresponsibly cuddled, coddled and insisted that Ukraine was in with more than a sporting chance to bloody and beat the clumsy Russian Bear that shows no signs of stepping down and hibernating, they now find themselves without a war sponsor in the United States. The previous US President Joe Biden had been more than willing to keep the war machine fed by proxy, furnishing Zelensky handsomely. The Washington war establishment purred, happy that Ukrainians were doing the dying and bleeding Russia’s soldiery white. Cant and righteousness were in abundant supply: the Ukrainians were foot soldiers wrapped in civilisation’s flag, democracy worn on their sleeves. Accusations from the Russian side that Ukrainian nationalism was also adulterated by a history of fascist inclination were dismissed out of hand. A country famously seized by kleptocrats, with a spotty, ill-nourished civil society, had been redrawn as a westward looking European state, besieged by the Oriental Barbarism of the East. If words of support could be counted as weapons, then Zelensky would have had a fresh arsenal in the aftermath of his tongue lashing by President Donald Trump and his deputy J.D. Vance. Much of these were provided by leaders gathered at Lancaster House on March 1 hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Starmer, for his part, promised that Europe would continue sustaining Ukraine’s efforts and, were a peace deal to arise, aid the country in improving its defences to ensure that 'Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself'. French President Emmanuel Macron tried to clarify any doubt that had arisen in the Oval Office savaging. 'There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago – and to keep doing so.' The 'we' in this case, Macron went on to add, involved 'Americans, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese, and many others.' Germany’s Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz also declared that 'we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war', affirming that 'we stand with Ukraine'. The country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, thought it prudent to point out that the Oval Office brawl 'underlined that a new age of infamy has begun', adding that Russia would be withstood 'even if the US withdraws support, so that it [Ukraine] can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation'. Other leaders expressed supportive words of standing. Donald Tusk of Poland: 'Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not standing alone.' Spain’s Pedro Sánchez: 'Ukraine, Spain stands with you.' Canada’s Justin Trudeau: '[we] will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace.' When they were not standing, many of these effusively supportive leaders were scrambling, teasingly suggesting a bloc of military support that may, somehow, be formed in the absence of US involvement. This would comprise the sillily worded 'coalition of the willing' (that expression, when used in 2003, saw the United States, UK and Australia, along with a motley collective, violate international law in invading Iraq). Such a coalition, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen dreamily envisaged, would transform Ukraine into a 'steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders'. This imaginatively foolish and recklessly irresponsible undertaking does little to patch up the irreplaceable role the US plays in a number of areas, not least the budgetary coverage of NATO, coupled with the promise for military intervention in the event a member state is attacked. Macron has, at stages, taken pot shots at NATO as cerebrally obsolete, a brain dead creature best be done away with. But these articulations, beyond such reports as NATO 2030, have not resulted in anything significant that would cope with an absentee US. European states, furthermore, are divided ahead of the March 6 summit, where the EU will supposedly approve some 20 billion euros for the purchase of missiles and air defence equipment for Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, in a letter to European Council President António Costa, offered the view that the EU, 'following the example of the United States – should enter into direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and sustainable peace in Ukraine'. Slovakia’s Prime Minister, Robert Fico, was even harder in his response, suggesting that financial and military assistance to Kyiv could be refused were ceasefire efforts not pursued, rejecting such notions as 'peace through strength' being advocated by various EU members. It was also incumbent, Fico went on to insist, that any settlement 'explicitly include a requirement to reopen the transit of gas through Ukraine to Slovakia and Western Europe.' With this in mind, and the pressing, crushing implications of power, not as fantasy, but as coarsening reality, other options must be entertained. Given their lack of punch and prowess, one arising from years fed by the devitalising US teat, European states are simply playing with toy soldiers. Eventually, they will have to play along if peace in Ukraine, however much detested in its form, is to be reached.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevYt1sus-mdLf	2025-03-04T10:05:27-08:00	
India And EU Reconfigure Their Bilateral Relations – OpEd	On February 27 and 28, Ursula von der Leyen visited India with her team of Commissioners to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and representatives from key Ministries to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries, at a time when Trump is threatening his trading partners, including the EU and India, with reciprocal tariffs. Of course, at this moment, Trump has mainly focused on the war of exchanging economic ammunition through tariffs with China. China also announced tariffs on a range of agricultural products in response to the new U.S. tariffs. The Chinese Ministry of Finance stated on Tuesday, February 25, that it would impose additional tariffs of 10% to 15% on agricultural products ranging from soybeans and corn to dairy and beef. The German politician stated about the India-Belgium partnership: 'The competition among major powers is an opportunity.' The trip of the President of the European Commission aims to increase the European Union's cooperation with New Delhi in the following areas: trade, technology, security, defense, connectivity, and global cooperation. 'The aim is for this visit to mark the beginning of this new era,' said von der Leyen, while Indian Prime Minister Modi stated on his part: 'This Commission College mission to India is unprecedented, it is a historic visit. The EU and India have the potential to become one of the defining partnerships of this century.' With these words, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, opened the meeting in New Delhi in the presence of Indian Prime Minister Modi. 'India,' von der Leyen stated, 'is the largest democracy and will soon be among the top 4 largest economies in the world. It is the guiding voice of the Global South. The EU is a cross-border democracy and a unique open economy. The largest trading partner for 80 countries. This world is full of dangers. But I believe that this modern version of great power competition is an opportunity for the EU and India to revitalize their cooperation.' Regarding the three pillars (trade and technology, security and defense, connectivity and global cooperation), the President of the European Commission concluded: 'I want this visit to mark the beginning of this new era. Prime Minister Modi and I share the same view. It is time to advance our EU-India strategic partnership to the next level. We are fighting for our security and prosperity. For the common global challenges we must address. And for the benefit of our respective regions and our partners around the world. Over the past thirty years, we have achieved much together. But in reality, we have only scratched the surface of the potential that exists. So it is not the time to set limits on our cooperation, nor to remain stuck in seeking agreement on every regional or global issue. It is time to be realistic and ambitious and to redefine our priorities according to today's realities.' But what is the practical significance of these commitments for future cooperation between India and the European Union? For the President of the European Commission, India can serve as a bridge between the South and the European Union, between the Indo-Pacific and Europe, as it represents a stable cushion of certainty in an uncertain world. Europe, on the other hand, is ready to invest productively to contribute to the realization of the goal of connectivity with India. Through the Global Gateway (our global infrastructure worth 300 billion euros), Europe is set to invest in energy transfer projects throughout India and between India and the rest of the world. Von der Leyen presented her plans, stating that this is just the beginning of the connectivity-building project between India and Europe. According to the Chancellor, 'the India-Middle East-Europe corridor launched in New Delhi in 2023 during India's G20 presidency is a historic opportunity to be revitalized as it is a fantastic project. This corridor can be a modern 'Silk Road' directly connecting India, the Arabian Gulf, and Europe. With a future railway connection, exchanges between India and Europe will become 40% faster. Could this be a subtle response to Elon Musk's ambitious plan to connect New York to London in 25 minutes via a $20 billion hyper-tunnel? And to advance the cooperation, one of the wishes of the Commission's president is the possibility of creating a free trade agreement between the EU and India. 'I know well that it will not be easy,' admitted von der Leyen, 'but I also know that timing and determination matter, and that this partnership comes at the right time for both.' Additionally, she added her willingness to cooperate with India on semiconductors, clean technology, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and public digital infrastructure. By investing together in these technologies and building strong supply chains, the European Union and India can create a real advantage for us in today's global and competitive economy by drawing on each country's mutual capabilities and talents. It was precisely about free trade that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke next during the press conference with Ursula von der Leyen. 'We are working together with the European Union,' explained Modi, 'to finalize a free trade agreement by 2025: we agree to collaborate on semiconductors, artificial intelligence, iGmega computers, and 6G.' The Commission's College mission to India was described by the Indian Prime Minister as 'unprecedented, a historic visit.' It seems that the common ground underlying the India-EU strategic partnership is a shared belief in democratic values and respect for the citizen within a rule of law social capitalism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevfIGg4NdYvKo	2025-03-04T10:03:39-08:00	
Offshore Wind: TotalEnergies And Partners Inaugurate 640 MW Yunli...	During a ceremony held in Taipei, TotalEnergies and its partners announced the successful inauguration of the Yunlin offshore wind farm in Taiwan, which is now fully operational and generating renewable electricity at its planned capacity of 640 MW. A new milestone for TotalEnergies in Asia TotalEnergies holds a 29.46% stake in Yunneng Wind Power Co., Ltd., the joint venture responsible for the project. The other stakeholders include Skyborn Renewables with 31.98%, EGCO Group with 26.56%, and Sojitz with 12%. The development and construction of the Yunlin project were led by Skyborn with the support of the other partners. Following the Commercial Operations Date (COD), expected in June 2025, TotalEnergies will take the lead in technical operations management, whilst Skyborn Renewables will continue to lead other management services. 'We are very pleased to be inaugurating the Yunlin offshore wind farm, as we take a new step forward in our offshore wind development', said Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President Renewables at TotalEnergies. 'This 640 MW project will help us achieve our 2025 targets for 35 GW of gross renewable capacity and over 50 TWh of net electricity production, amounting to 10% of TotalEnergies’ energy output. Our role as technical operator on Yunlin will allow us to strengthen our offshore wind competencies as we look ahead to our future projects in Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom', he added.In Asia, TotalEnergies owns a renewable energy portfolio (solar, wind, batteries) of over 23 GW gross, across all stages, from development to construction and operation. Of this capacity, 50% is already operational or under construction. One of the largest offshore wind farms in Taiwan The Yunlin offshore wind farm is located about 15 kilometers off the west coast of Taiwan, at water depths of up to 35 meters. The project consists of 80 wind turbines, each with 8 MW capacity. The electricity generated is fed into the Taiwanese grid and contracted to Taiwan Power Company (TPC) through two 20-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) at an average rate of $165/MWh. The Yunlin offshore wind farm produces 2.4 TWh of renewable electricity per year, powering over 600,000 Taiwanese households and reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 1.2 million tons.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBa6u97vTevVmRQJ6_F6vh	2025-03-04T10:01:24-08:00	
US Troop Withdrawal: Can Indonesia And ASEAN Fill Security Vacuum...	The withdrawal of United States soldiers from South Korea would significantly impact regional security, economic stability, and diplomatic relations on the Korean Peninsula. Given the shifting power dynamics, increased collaboration among neighboring countries is essential. For instance, ASEAN and Indonesia could fill in the vacuum and play a pivotal role as mediators to help reduce instability and foster dialogue in the Korean Peninsula if the United States withdrew its troops from South Korea. The presence of the U.S military in South Korea has played a role in maintaining stability in the region ever since the Korean War era began in 1950. A substantial number of troops totaling up to 28,000 are currently deployed on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. presence acts as a deterrent against aggression from North Korea and is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of South Korea and its allies. This strategic significance is further underscored by escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, driven by China's growing influence and North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Conversely, discussions about the withdrawal of U.S. troops raise important concerns regarding security gaps, increased regional arms competition, and the future of diplomatic relations. In the year 2025, in the period of President Trump's second term in office, the U.S government requested that South Korea provide compensation for hosting U.S Armed Forces in the Korean Peninsula. Failure to meet these obligations would result in troop withdrawal by the United States, introducing uncertainty into the region's security and diplomatic situation. The primary security concern following the U.S. exit is the increased risk from North Korea's escalating threats in the region. Without U.S. forces stationed there, there would be less deterrence against aggression from Pyongyang and a greater chance of military escalation by the North Korean regime. North Korea has consistently advanced its missile and nuclear programs, with significant progress in its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities in 2024. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea could create heightened security challenges for the country and potentially ignite an arms race among neighboring nations, including Japan, China, and Russia. Consequently, South Korea may need to increase its defense budget and military capabilities, which could strain its economy. The decision to withdraw tactfully could strain the relationship between the United States and South Korea as it has long been a source of security for South Korea, and any abrupt change in approach may raise doubts in Seoul about Washington's loyalty to its partners. This uncertainty may prompt South Korea to consider security options that could bring it closer to China. A diminished U.S. presence in the region could further enhance China's influence. Additionally, ongoing efforts to improve Korean relations and advance nuclear disarmament may be jeopardized. Without U.S. support, South Korea may struggle to negotiate effectively and could lose its leverage in discussions with North Korea. The potential impact of a U.S. retreat on the economy would be substantial, particularly because South Korea plays a significant role in the global economy. Any instability in South Korea could trigger global repercussions. Investor doubts might arise, leading to capital flight and market fluctuations. The absence of U.S. troops could create economic insecurity, affecting trade and investments not only in South Korea but also beyond its borders. ASEAN nations, which rely heavily on stable trade ties in the region, could also feel the effects. Disruptions in stability in South Korea could impact sectors such as electronics and automotive, given their connections with ASEAN countries and technology supply chains. The historical tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to impact its stability today. The Korean War never officially ended; instead, it paused with the 1953 Armistice Agreement, resulting in a fragile ceasefire. North Korea's pursuit of weapons and occasional provocations threaten regional peace. Despite diplomatic efforts, including meetings between the U.S. and North Korea, progress on denuclearization has been limited. Failed interactions have further heightened tensions, increasing the risk of conflict. Additionally, escalating tensions between South Korea and Japan, fueled by grievances and economic disputes, add further complexity to the security landscape. Potential conflicts may arise from various clashes. If the North Korean government were to collapse, shifts in alliances towards China or Russia could become significant factors to consider. In a worst-case scenario where U.S. troops are no longer present in the region, tensions between North and South Korea could escalate, especially if North Korea perceives their absence as an opportunity to provoke confrontation. Additionally, the collapse of the North Korean regime due to internal strife or external pressure might trigger a refugee crisis that would require global assistance to manage effectively. Furthermore, South Korea could find itself compelled to seek security assurances from China, which could alter the region's power dynamics. Despite these challenges, ASEAN has the opportunity to act as a stabilizing influence. With a history of diplomatic involvement through platforms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit, ASEAN's neutral stance allows it to foster dialogue among key players, including North and South Korea, as well as China and the United States. As a united entity, ASEAN holds the diplomatic power to reduce conflicts and promote peaceful resolutions. Indonesia occupies a significant role within ASEAN as a leading economy and a key member capable of spearheading various initiatives. Its historical interactions with North and South Korea as a respected mediator highlight its potential to facilitate diplomatic engagements between the two nations. Indonesia's previous efforts in hosting peace dialogues and its active participation in denuclearization talks demonstrate its ability to positively influence negotiations and reduce tensions, leveraging its position as an aligned nation. To effectively prevent conflicts, strategies such as organizing discussions, utilizing discreet diplomatic channels, and promoting economic collaboration among nations can be considered. One way ASEAN can enhance stability is by strengthening connections among neighboring regions to lessen the need for dependence and establish financial motivations for peace-building efforts. Moreover, encouraging conversations between North and South Korea via ASEAN-led platforms may nurture trust and collaboration. Furthermore, supporting nonaligned defense partnerships could aid in maintaining a power structure in the area without triggering tensions. In conclusion, the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from South Korea presents security, political, and economic challenges. Their absence could empower North Korea, strain alliances, and disrupt economic stability. However, ASEAN countries, particularly Indonesia, can help mitigate these risks by serving as neutral intermediaries. South Korea needs to strengthen its defense capabilities, ASEAN should enhance institutional frameworks, and the global community must support regional stability through diplomatic efforts and economic cooperation. Ensuring the security of the Korean Peninsula is vital for overall stability, and ASEAN plays a crucial role in fostering lasting peace and harmony in the region.

Ancient Sacrifice Fuels Modern Global Justice – OpEd	(UCA News) -- In the heart of one of Sao Paulo's favelas, Sister Maria Oliveira ladles steaming feijoada into bowls for hundreds of hungry families. Her soup kitchen, Projeto Esperança (Project Hope), represents a powerful transformation of Lenten tradition into social action. 'Empty stomachs can fuel either despair or action,' she says. 'We chose action.' From Ancient Roots to Modern Activism The 40-day Christian season of Lent, dating back to the 4th century, has historically been marked by prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. This ancient practice mirrors similar periods of spiritual discipline across faith traditions — from Ramadan in Islam to periods of austerity in Buddhism and Hinduism. What began as personal spiritual purification has evolved into a catalyst for collective social transformation. According to religious historian Dr. Teresa Berger of Yale Divinity School, 'Lenten practices have always contained seeds of social justice. The early Church fathers emphasized that true fasting meant sharing bread with the hungry, not merely abstaining from food.' In Brazil, Sister Oliveira's community transformed this ancient tradition of Lenten fasting into a sustained campaign for food security. 'Each meal we forgo funds a community kitchen that now feeds 200 families in our favela,' she explains, demonstrating how spiritual sacrifice can manifest as tangible social change. Global Reverberations This reimagining of ancient spiritual practices has sparked similar movements worldwide. In Manila's Tondo district, the 'Voices of Lent' movement united Catholic churches, Muslim communities, and secular organizations to address housing violations. Their shared 40-day commitment to amplifying stories of the urban poor forced local authorities to confront long-ignored issues. The movement has gained momentum in environmental activism. In Germany, the Catholic relief agency Misereor launched its 2024 Lenten campaign with a stark message: 'The Amazon is bleeding.' According to Misereor's annual report, by partnering with the Munduruku people, the initiative channeled Lenten donations into legal battles against illegal gold mining. Their efforts contributed to a significant victory when the European Union banned gold imports linked to Amazon deforestation in March 2024, according to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. In South Korea, the Catholic Climate Movement redefined sacrifice during Lent when more than 50,000 households slashed energy use by 40%. According to a report published by the Korean Catholic Climate Action Network, their 'Carbon Fast,' tracked via a mobile app, pressured Seoul's government to accelerate emissions targets, the Korea Herald reported in April last year. Meanwhile, in Paris, climate group Alternatiba's 40-day Lenten vigil outside TotalEnergies' headquarters influenced shareholders to scale back Arctic drilling plans, as reported by Le Monde on April 3, 2024. The Catholic Church's Lenten Campaign for Hunger and Peace The Catholic Church's global Lenten Campaign for Hunger and Peace represents one of the most significant institutional efforts to harness this ancient tradition for contemporary challenges. Established by Pope Paul VI in 1967, this worldwide initiative has evolved from simple almsgiving to addressing systemic causes of poverty and conflict. In India, the campaign has taken on distinctive characteristics, reflecting the country's unique challenges. According to Caritas India's 2023 annual report, their '40 Days for Life and Dignity' campaign mobilized over 600 parishes across 12 states to address food insecurity and religious discrimination. In Kerala, the campaign funded sustainable agriculture initiatives that helped 3,000 small-scale farmers transition to organic methods, while in Jharkhand, it supported legal aid for indigenous communities facing displacement. Father Thomas D'Souza, Director of Caritas India, noted: 'Our Lenten campaign is not simply about charity but about transforming unjust structures. We ask people not just to give up luxuries but to give up indifference.' The campaign raised approximately 120 million rupees (approximately $1.5 million) during Lent 2023, with 85% going to domestic programs and 15% to international solidarity efforts, Indian Catholic Matters reported in May 2023. Globally, the Lenten Campaign for Hunger and Peace has established enduring institutions in over 100 countries. In El Salvador, it supports cooperatives founded during the civil war that now provide livelihoods for thousands. In Rwanda, it funds reconciliation programs bringing together perpetrators and survivors of genocide. According to the Pontifical Council Cor Unum's 2023 report, the campaign raised over €500 million (US$524.6 million) globally, representing one of the largest faith-based humanitarian initiatives in the world. Transformative Power in Conflict Zones The transformation of Lenten practices has proven particularly powerful in conflict zones. In Ukraine, Orthodox priests reimagined the traditional fast as a platform for peacebuilding. Father Dmitri Kovlov's 'Breaking Bread, Building Peace' initiative brings together divided communities for dialogue. 'In times of war,' he says, 'our Lenten sacrifice must be our prejudices, not just our food.' The Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s news site, Religiyna Pravda, reported that over 50 communities participated in these reconciliation meals during Lent 2024 The movement has even influenced corporate behavior. In Germany, the 'Corporate Conscience Campaign' documented by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last year saw business leaders commit to 40 days of ethical business practices and worker-centered policies, resulting in improved labor relations and increased social responsibility investments. Embodied Sacrifice Perhaps most striking was the impact in the Philippines, where Lent 2023 brought significant change to Negros Occidental. For 40 days, 200 farmers lived on coconut water and rice gruel, their bodies becoming living testimonies to injustice. According to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, their demand for the return of ancestral lands seized by sugar barons succeeded, with the government redistributing 1,200 hectares by Easter. In Kenya, the 2024 '40 Days of Mourning' campaign transformed Lent into a powerful statement against gender-based violence. After a tragic January saw 45 women murdered, Catholic nuns and Muslim leaders launched nightly vigils outside courthouses. The Nation newspaper at the time reported that their persistent protests pressured President Ruto to fast-track a Family Protection Bill, imposing life sentences for femicide. Even in Haiti's challenging conditions, Lent inspired creative solutions. The Church's '40 Days of Light' campaign distributed 15,000 solar lamps in gang-controlled Port-au-Prince, funded by meals forgone during the Lenten fast. 'No electricity? We became the light,' youth coordinator Jean-Paul Desrosiers, was quoted in The Miami Herald's coverage of the initiative. Digital Amplification and Lasting Impact The digital age has amplified these voices of hope. The '#40DaysOfJustice' social media campaign connected activists across continents, from indigenous rights defenders in Bolivia to anti-trafficking organizations in Thailand, sharing daily testimonies of challenges and transformation. According to an April 2024 report by the World Council of Churches, the campaign reached over 10 million people across six continents. While critics argue these Lenten campaigns risk reducing justice to a seasonal trend, 2024's movements have shown signs of endurance. Germany's Misereor now funds year-round Amazon legal defense, while Kenya's anti-femicide coalition maintains monthly vigils. In Sao Paulo, Sister Oliveira's kitchen continues beyond the Lenten season, embodying her belief that 'Easter is not an endpoint. It is a promise that sacrifice can spur resurrection — in our streets, not just our souls.' Conclusion: Ancient Wisdom, Contemporary Power These diverse initiatives demonstrate how ancient spiritual practices can illuminate paths toward justice and renewal in our fragmented world. The 40-day Lenten journey — with roots stretching back 16 centuries — continues to evolve, offering a powerful template for sustained social engagement in an age of fleeting attention spans and ephemeral activism. What makes these Lenten-inspired movements particularly effective is their integration of spiritual discipline with social action, personal transformation with systemic change. The ancient wisdom of deliberate sacrifice creates space for deeper reflection on structural injustice while the time-bound nature of the season provides urgency and focus. As Lent continues to be reimagined across different contexts and cultures, it reveals the enduring power of ancient spiritual practices to inspire, sustain, and amplify movements for justice. In an era when activism often struggles to maintain staying power, these movements demonstrate that ancient wisdom, when creatively reinterpreted, can provide both the spiritual resources and practical frameworks needed to nurture lasting social transformation.

Will The US Leave NATO? Officials Push Back Against Rising Doubts...	By Rikard Jozwiak (RFE/RL) -- We’ve been here before -- declaring NATO dead or dying. Recently, U.S. Republican Senator Mike Lee posted on X, saying: 'It’s time to leave NATO and the UN.' Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, responded simply: 'I agree.' While officials in Brussels and elsewhere note that Musk often shares political opinions on his platform, X, without necessarily shaping U.S. policy, some observers acknowledge his access to Trump and his informal influence in certain conservative circles in Washington, D.C. Still, NATO officials at their Brussels headquarters have remained surprisingly calm so far. Their answer to whether the alliance’s demise is imminent is still a resounding 'No' for two reasons: the gap between rhetoric and action; and the difference between NATO allies and NATO aspirants – notably Ukraine. U.S. Wants Greater Defense Spending Take the first reason. As recently as last week, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to NATO’s mutual defense clause, Article 5, in remarks alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. That stance was reiterated multiple times -- both publicly and privately -- by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels in February. While he firmly insisted that European allies must significantly increase their defense spending, everyone I spoke to described the discussions as constructive. 'He never left the room, listened, asked questions, and took notes -- not the behavior of an ally about to quit,' one NATO ambassador told me. And in that vein, NATO diplomats continue to navigate the constant speculation. 'We need to decipher what it all means, said one senior official. 'But we’ve also learned that we should ignore the noise and look at actions. It’s a sort of ‘strategic patience’ we must practice.' Ukraine's Uncertain NATO Path Ukraine, however, is a different matter. 'The Ukraine track has changed, but not the NATO track. They’ve been pretty tough on Ukraine but remain committed to NATO,' one alliance ambassador observed. The shift in tone toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy is one clear example, but Britain’s new role in coordinating arms deliveries to Ukraine is another indicator. It’s also evident that Ukraine won’t be joining NATO anytime soon -- though, in truth, it was the Biden administration that blocked Kyiv’s membership at recent NATO summits, much to the quiet relief of some Western European countries. The new U.S. administration is just more blunt about it. What countries on NATO’s eastern flank are now asking is whether American troops will remain stationed there. For now, the answer is yes, though many acknowledge concerns about an impending review of U.S. troop levels in Europe. But if these countries are attacked by Russia, will U.S. forces come to their aid? The prevailing belief is that they will. but Article 5 of the NATO treaty depends on both allies and adversaries believing it will hold. As one Eastern European official put it: 'It’s like Schroedinger’s cat -- it exists in both states, alive and dead, until the box is opened. In NATO’s case, until Article 5 is actually tested, we won’t really know.' Rikard Jozwiak is the Europe editor for RFE/RL in Prague, focusing on coverage of the European Union and NATO.

Rebuilding Trust In China’s Food Safety System – Analysis	By Lei Liu and Meilin Tang A food scandal has rocked China, following a report from state-backed media The Beijing News on 2 July 2024, which revealed that Hopefull Grain & Oil Group and China Grain Reserves Oil and Fat had used fuel trucks to transport edible oils without undergoing a mandatory cleaning process for years. The government reacted rapidly, initiating joint investigations, detaining the truck owner and drivers and launching a nationwide rectification campaign towards edible oil transportation. Still, the event evoked harsh criticism and extensive anxiety over China’s food safety. The Chinese government has long been struggling with food safety issues. In 2009, China enacted its Food Safety Law, followed by amendments in 2015, 2018 and 2021. Since 2016, China has been committed to implementing a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for food safety violations and established two national networks to monitor food contamination risks and food-borne illnesses. According to the 2024 ‘Research Report on Food Safety Status in China’, the pass rate for food sampling inspections remained above 97 per cent from 2019–23. But public trust in food safety remains low. A survey conducted by Jiangnan University in 2022 showed that only 47.2 per cent of respondents were satisfied with local food safety, though 59.4 per cent expressed confidence in prospects for future changes to food safety procedures. The oil scandal has once again pushed China’s food safety issue to the forefront. Now the concern is not only coming from the Chinese public, but also the international community given China’s recent visa-free policies attracted 8.54 million international tourists in the first half of 2024, a 190.1 per cent increase from 2023. The sense of insecurity regarding China’s food system could undermine the willingness of tourists to travel to China. China’s food safety problem has also severely damaged the international reputation of Chinese food businesses and sparked concerns about the loss of competitiveness for food exports. China’s food safety problem primarily lies in its weak regulatory enforcement. Complex food supply chains and the emergence of internet-based sales platforms call for cross-departmental, cross-level and cross-regional regulatory enforcement, which remain lax and clumsy. Inadequate punishments for food safety violations incentivise producers to produce and sell non-compliant food as the benefits of violating safety laws exceed the costs. Corruption is also a significant challenge. There have been numerous reports of canteen contractors and school principals colluding to provide poor quality food to students. The framework of co-regulation with businesses and the public remains underdeveloped, which weakens regulatory oversight. Beijing must urgently implement concrete solutions to regain the public’s trust in food safety measures. The government must improve its enforcement capacity to respond effectively to public outrage in the wake of food safety scandals. Mainstream media channels, especially official ones, must take the lead in providing accurate and timely information to minimise the spread of inaccurate information on social media during food crises. Administrative procedures for official media responses should be simplified to improve the efficiency of communication with the public. Stakeholders outside government must also improve public communication channels. Businesses should establish or support non-profit public information centres that provide science-based food safety information. China can also leverage social media by creating portals for reporting food safety problems to foster public awareness and participation. China must also strengthen its whistleblower protection system and raise rewards for reporting violations. The government must also fix loopholes and weaknesses in its food safety management system. China should expand nationally unified standards and align them to international benchmarks. Though China has issued 1610 entries of food safety standards — covering over 340 food types — several problems remain, including relatively low standards, an incomplete food classification system and insufficient mandatory standards. More severe punishments should be imposed on businesses for food safety violations. China should implement a risk-based rating mechanism and system to allocate regulatory measures with different intensities based on comprehensive assessments of businesses’ risk levels according to factors such as business characteristics, random inspection records and regional attributes. Beijing must strengthen cross-regional supervision. With the development of retail food markets, especially food e-commerce, production and consumption of food products increasingly involve multiple jurisdictions. Data sharing platforms and joint law enforcement mechanisms between different regions are necessary to enable a more coordinated response to food safety risks and curb the challenges of administrative division. China has one of the most advanced information technology systems in the world, which could be more extensively employed to empower food safety regulation by integrating online and offline regulation and facilitate fast information dissemination and transparent state–citizen interaction.

Greenland And The US: Will Trump’s Arctic Vision Prevail? – Analy...	By Prithvi Gupta Over the recent weeks, the United States’ (US) President Donald Trump has expressed his imminent interest in purchasing Greenland, a self-governed island of Denmark. Trump has repeatedly stated that Greenland is critical for American national and economic security and, therefore, should be made a part of the US. This idea was met with scepticism from the Greenlanders, mainland Danes, and Europeans, who viewed it as expansionist and imperial, with the Danish Prime Minister (PM) Mette Frederiksen stating that her country is not for sale. This article analyses the geoeconomic and strategic rationale of Trump’s Greenland bid for preserving and furthering US national and economic security and forecasts plausible scenarios for the future. Strategic and geoeconomic rationale In the initial days of Trump’s Greenland bid, the Europeans assumed that the idea of purchasing Greenland was nothing more than a pressure tactic at securing increasing access to the Arctic island’s mineral resources, and expanding US military operations in the critical region, where China and Russia have increased their naval activities—military or otherwise. However, since January 2025, after a call between the Danish PM Mette Frederiksen and President Trump, the Danes have been in crisis mode as President Trump made his administration’s views clear on the strategic necessity of the island being a part of the US. This is not the first time the US has endeavoured to purchase Greenland from Denmark. A closer look at US history delineates the precedent of purchasing foreign land amid geopolitical turmoil and upheaval. For instance, after its loss in the Crimean War, Russia sold Alaska to the US in 1867 for US$ 8.2 million; the US and Russia shared hostility towards the erstwhile British Empire—then a dominant naval power in the Indian and Pacific Oceans—whom Moscow and Washington wished to counter. This was Washington’s first foray into the Arctic. Since then, different US administrations have proposed purchasing Greenland in 1867, 1910, 1946, 1955, 2019, and finally, 2025. Recently, the Arctic imperative has found increasing political support in Washington, especially after the 2022 Russian aggression in Ukraine. The reasons for Trump’s interests in the Arctic can be assessed as related to security, great power calculations, and geoeconomics. Security rationale As the Russian-Ukraine crisis gathered momentum, Finland and Sweden also joined the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in 2023 and 2024, respectively, making all the Arctic members (except Russia) NATO members. Besides, Russia’s civilian and military nuclear facilities in the Arctic increased from 62 to 81 between 2021 and 2025 and are poised to cross 110 by 2035. These bases are host to nuclear-powered missiles, submarines, and other nuclear weapons—ranging from the Burevestnik missiles to the Poseidon torpedos. These bases are also testing grounds for Russian nuclear military equipment. Due to these developments, Moscow is the dominant military power in the Arctic. Russian territory includes over 50 percent of the Arctic coastline and has 22 military bases along the Arctic coast as opposed to NATO’s 20, of which 11 belong to Norway. Notably, Greenland hosts the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, a US military installation key to missile early warning and defence and space surveillance. Countering Russia’s military and nuclear expansion in the Arctic can be one of the security reasons for President Trump’s Greenland bid. Geoeconomic security Greenland is also strategically located along two potential shipping routes: the Northwest Passage and the Transpolar Sea Route. These routes are currently untraversable due to the treacherous terrain, weather, and ice. However, as commercial traffic in the Arctic Ocean increases, these routes will be important for global and regional trade. Greenland is strategically positioned to benefit from the comprehensive marine infrastructure required to operationalise and control these routes and assist in emergency management, prevention, and response in the Arctic. Today, 500 ships undertake multiple voyages in the Arctic annually, a 37-percent increasebetween 2013 and 2023. Besides geostrategic location vis-à-vis shipping routes, Greenland's natural resources may have also piqued President Trump’s interest. Greenland’s rare-earth minerals (REMs) allows the US to reduce its reliance on China, which dominates the global critical minerals supply chains. Greenland possesses vast deposits of lithium, graphite, yttrium, and cobalt—all essential for manufacturing batteries, wind and solar technologies, and advanced military equipment. Greenland also possesses massive unexplored off-shore oil and gas reserves and abundant, undepleted fisheries, which weigh into the Trumpian calculations, as well. Access to the Arctic routes and Greenland’s abundant natural resources can be pivotal to the US trade and economy and may constitute President Trump’s Greenlandic calculations. Great power calculations Additionally, China, which views itself as a ‘near-Arctic’ state, has increased military and economic cooperation in the Russian Arctic. Sino-Russian joint coastal guard and military exercises and investments along the Russian Arctic in logistics and energy infrastructure through the Polar Silk Road framework culminated in the establishment of a joint Russia-China Arctic sub-governance and cooperation mechanism to oversee all economic and political cooperation. Chinese investments in the Russian Arctic total US$ 90 billion, cementing the Russia-China econo-security partnership in the Arctic. It is plausible that the Greenland purchase is intended to form a bulwark of resistance against the Chinese and Russians in the Arctic. Domestic resistance is reduced by the current political situation in US legislation and executive bodies. As the Trump-led Republican party now controls the US House of Representatives, the US Senate and the White House, legislating and executing a Greenland purchase is a surmountable task for the 47th President of the United States (POTUS). In fact, on 14 January 2025, in the US House of Representatives, a Republican Representative from Tennessee, Andy Ogles, led several of his Republican colleagues in introducing the ‘Make Greenland Great Again (MGGA) Act’, which would direct the US Congress to support President Trump’s negotiations with Denmark in acquiring Greenland immediately. Following the approval of this Act, the POTUS can formally proceed to negotiate the Greenland purchase. Plausibility and scenarios Among other plausible turnouts, four future scenarios seem likely. As President Trump has not ruled out economic and military force to annex Greenland as a US territory, there is the possibility that he will impose tariffs and sanctions on Denmark’s trade with the US. It is notable that Denmark is part of the European Economic Community (EEC) and that there will be a ripple effect of any potential US sanctions on Denmark. Main Danish exports to the US include pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical technologies. Another possibility, which seems highly unlikely yet plausible, is that Trump invades Greenland. Denmark is a NATO ally, and any military action by the US will damage the transatlantic alliance beyond repair, reaping benefits for China and Russia. The third plausibility is that President Trump simply loses interest in the Greenland bid and pauses after Denmark commits to meet the NATO obligations in the Arctic and upgrades the Greenlandic defence infrastructure to adequate standards. There is speculation that this is the latent aim behind President Trump’s Greenland bid. The last plausible scenario, which is a long-term one with many hiccups along the road, is that Greenland gains independence from Denmark and establishes closer ties with the US. Currently, Denmark provides US$ 600 million worth of subsidies to the Greenlanders, which is 50 percent of the Greenland government’s annual budget. Before gaining independence, Greenland needs to fix its economy. Conclusion 2025 does not mark the first instance where Washington has proposed a Greenland purchase, thereby giving precedent to President Trump’s bid. Although his transatlantic allies ridicule this idea, Trump’s bid displays the growing geopolitical and economic importance of the Arctic region in global affairs.. Trump’s bid may be rooted in strategic, economic and great-power delineations; purchasing Greenland is still an uphill task. The idea’s feasibility depends on Danish resistance, US political will, and Greenland’s fiscal self-sufficiency. The Arctic’s future hinges on these unfolding dynamics.

Afghanistan: Weakening Regime – Analysis	By Ajit Kumar Singh The ‘political landscape’ of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan is in increasing turmoil. A deep divide has emerged between the Kandahari group led by Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada and the Haqqani Group led by Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Haqqani Group also includes Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar and Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai. These three – Haqqani, Baradar and Stanikzai – are among the most prominent Taliban leaders after Akhundzada. Indeed, at the time of writing two of these three top leaders of the Haqqani Group – Sirajuddin Haqqani and Abbas Stanikzai – have left the country and are currently residing in United Arab Emirate (UAE). There were rumours of disaffection around Baradar’s absence as well, since it overlapped with Haqqani and Stanikzai’s, but he has returned to Kabul. The first to leave the country was Stanikzai who openly challenged Akhundzada, calling his decision to ban girls' education and other restrictions on women his 'personal choice'. He stated on January 18, 2025, Today, we are committing an injustice against 20 million people out of a total population of 40 million. We have stripped them of all their rights by closing the doors to schools and universities for them, giving them away as compensation in personal disputes, and preventing them from choosing their husbands. Are we truly following Sharia? … The path we are currently following is guided by personal choice, not Sharia... We call on the leadership of the Islamic Emirate [Taliban] to make education accessible to everyone. He added, Follow him [Akhundzada], but not to the extent that, God forbid, you grant him the rank of prophethood or divinity. If you [Akhundzada] deviate even a step from God's path, then you are no longer my leader, I do not recognize you. Stanikzai went on to add that the world was critical of the Taliban's curbs on women and 'this is precisely the problem' that they have with the Afghan government, which has not been officially recognized by any country, primarily because of the regime's treatment of the female population. Stanikzai has been opposing the policy of restricting women rights for long, but this was the first time that he openly challenged Akhundzada. Ibraheem Bahiss, an analyst with Crisis Group’s South Asia program, noted that Stanikzai had periodically made statements calling girls’ education a right of all Afghan women. Bahiss added, 'However, this latest statement seems to go further in the sense that he is publicly calling for a change in policy and questioned the legitimacy of the current approach.' Days later Stanikzai fled the country to escape an arrest warrant and travel ban imposed by Akhundzada. Stanikzai who was to be arrested and tried in a military court, managed to escape as Afghanistan Defence Minister, Mullah Yaqoob, a key Stanikzai ally, had intervened to facilitate his safe departure and arranged for his travel to Dubai. Stanikzai claimed, however, that he was travelling to the UAE because of health issues. Sirajuddin Haqqani is also in the UAE. According to a United Nations Security Council statement issued on January 22, 2025, Haqqani was granted a travel exemption to perform Umrah in Saudi Arabia between January 23 and February 3. However, sources indicate that he has not returned, despite the expiration of the United Nations travel exemption. Haqqani left the country amid reports that Akhundzada had curtailed his powers, leading to a deep divide between the two. Akhundzada had stripped the Ministries of Defence, Interior and the General Directorate of Intelligence of the powers to distribute weapons, ammunition and military equipment. As per the directives, Akhundzada, was to decide on all distribution of military equipment. It was claimed that Akhundzada made this decision after Sirajuddin Haqqani distributed quantities of weapons among his supporters in the eastern provinces. Confirming the new decree, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid stated on November 8, 2024, that the decree was issued with the aim of 'proper management and security of weapons' and to prevent the 'misuse' of military equipment. More importantly, Khalil Rahman Haqqani, a senior Afghan Taliban figure and Acting Minister of Refugees and Repatriation and his three bodyguards were killed in a suicide blast in the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation compound in Kabul on December 11, 2024. Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the Haqqani network, and was the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current leader of the Haqqani network and the Taliban Interior Minister. Privately, most Haqqani supporters accused his rivals in the Taliban of ordering his assassination. Haqqani’s visit to the UAE was publicized by the Taliban on January 22, but little was disclosed about its purpose. However, Jilani Zwak, an Afghan journalist, noted that the UAE had been playing a unique intermediary role in Taliban-United States (US) relations. Zwak argued, 'I don’t think this trip was about Afghanistan’s relations with the UAE. It was more about Afghanistan’s relations with the United States – and more specifically, the Haqqani network’s ties with Washington. The UAE has served as a mediator between the Taliban and the US.' Significantly, Mohammad Asif Siddiqui, a former deputy chairman of Afghanistan’s Senate, had earlier claimed that senior Taliban figures currently outside Afghanistan were working to undermine Akhundzada’s authority: 'These figures – Haqqani, Baradar, and Stanikzai – are all in the UAE and Qatar… Qatar, which played a key role in bringing the Taliban to power, is now pressuring foreign powers to push for a leadership change within the Taliban.' It is not a coincidence that Stanikzai, on January 4, 2025, had praised the then US President-elect Donald Trump as a 'decisive and courageous' person. He had stated, 'One or two weeks from now, he [Trump] will come to power. He should change his policy, abandon Biden’s policy, and create a new approach. From Afghanistan and the Islamic Emirate’s side, the path is open for them. If they intend friendship, we will extend a hand of friendship as well. An enemy does not remain an enemy forever, and a friend does not remain a friend forever.' Meanwhile, the third prominent leader of the group Abdul Ghani Baradar Abdul Ghani Baradar, returned to Kabul ahead of schedule, cutting short a UN-approved travel exemption that allowed him to stay in Qatar till March 3, 2025, for medical treatment. He had left Afghanistan on February 9, but attended a ceremony in Kabul on February 20, to inaugurate several development projects. Indeed, the Kandahari faction’s rigidity on the strict implementation of regressive Sharia laws across the country has created a deep divide within the Taliban. The Ultra-conservative Kandahari group and the ‘moderate’ Haqqani group have been at loggerhead, and speculation is rife that the Haqqani Group is trying to remove Akhundzada. Moreover, the Akhundzada group’s policies have pushed a large proportion of the population away from the regime. On July 24, 2024, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) survey report, based on interviews of 888 women in 33 provinces and 64 men in 14 provinces, noted that only four per cent of Afghans want the Taliban government to be internationally recognized. The survey also found that only two per cent of women reported having 'good' or 'full' influence over decision-making processes in their communities, compared to 18 per cent of men. 64 per cent of women said they 'never' felt safe when alone at home, while only two per cent of men felt secure when leaving home with a female family member. These developments have enormously compounded the Taliban’s problems. Overall fatalities which had fallen from 1,653 in 2022 to 501 in 2023, increased to 856 in 2024, an increase of 70.85 per cent. 2025 has already recorded at least 137 fatalities (data till March 2). Two of the principal challengers to the Taliban regime – the resistance forces and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) – remain potent threats. The National Resistance Front's military activities started in August 2021 when the Taliban attacked us in the Panjshir Valley [in northern Afghanistan]. Since then, we have been resisting them. We started from two provinces in the north, yet now we have networks and operations in almost 20 provinces after three years of expansion. Our operations at the moment are unconventional and mostly guerrilla operations. Yet, the military wing of the National Resistance Front is based inside Afghanistan, our bases, and our commando units are all in the country, and… we are increasing our recruitment and operational capacity. The National Resistance Front (NRF) which initiated the onslaught against the Taliban regime in August 2021 itself - the Taliban returned to power on August 15, 2021 - still remains the biggest challenge for the Taliban regime. According to Institute for Conflict Management (ICM) data, NRF has killed 36 Taliban fighters in the current year, so far, without losing a single fighter of its own. In 2024, NRF killed 444 Taliban fighters, losing six of its own. Since August 2021, NRF has killed a total of 1,777 Taliban fighters and has lost 236 cadres (data till March 2, 2025). Earlier, as reported on September 1, 2024, Ahamd Massoud, the exiled leader of NRF, asserted, The second most lethal resistance force, the Afghanistan Freedom Front (AFF) has killed 52 Taliban fighters in the current year, so far (data till March 2, 2025). No AFF fighter has been killed in these incidents. Through 2024, AFF had killed 230 Taliban fighters, and lost just three of its own. On February 27, 2025, AFF claimed on X that, over the preceding three years (the group was formed in 2022), the Front had executed a total of 330 successful operations, resulting in the elimination of 821 Taliban fighters and injuries to another 868, and had lost 13 of its own. These operations included 87 targeted attacks in the preceding year alone, on Taliban bases, checkpoints, and gathering points, killing 229 Taliban militants and injuring 166. AFF asserted that it had expanded its military operations to 31 provinces across Afghanistan (out of a total of 34 provinces in the country); enhanced its organizational structure and operational capabilities; and improved strategic communications, intelligence, and field operations. There are several other resistance forces, including the Afghanistan Liberation Movement, the Afghanistan Liberation Front, the National Mobilization Front, and the Afghanistan Islamic National and Liberation Movement, which are fighting against the Taliban regime. There have been numerous attempts to bring all these resistance forces together to put more pressure on the Taliban. For instance, in a first meeting in April 2024, the NRF and AFF discussed the possibilities of unity and coordination between. However, no further developments have been reported in this regard. These groups pose a critical challenge for the Taliban regime in its efforts to consolidate its position as the legitimate government and true representative of Afghanistan. Engaged in territorial battle with these resistance forces, the Taliban is also finding it difficult to control the unabated terrorist activities of the IS-KP, which has undermined security and is a constant threat to the civilian population. ICM data indicates that there was a total of 247 civilian fatalities in 2024, with the IS-KP alone responsible for at least 135 of these. While perpetrators of 76 civilian killings remained unidentified, the Taliban killed 36 civilians. 11 civilians have already been killed in 2025, two of them by IS-KP in two separate incidents: January 21: A Chinese national named Li, who was working in the mining sector, was killed while travelling with his Afghan translator, in an attack along the Dasht-e-Qala road, which connects the Taluqan and Khwaja Bahauddin Districts in Takhar Province. On January 22, IS-KP took responsibility for the killing stating: 'Yesterday, the soldiers of the Caliphate targeted a vehicle carrying a Chinese communist in the village of Katakjar, Takhar, using a machine gun, resulting in his death and damage to his vehicle.'January 7: Abdul Razaq, an imam and teacher at a local seminary, was killed, and Hamdullah Mohammadi, a preacher at the New City Mosque, was injured in an attack orchestrated by IS-KP in the Baghlan-e-Jadid District of Baghlan Province. Though the Taliban has repeatedly claimed that it has ended the presence of IS-KP in Afghanistan, it is abundantly clear that the IS-KP remains a potent threat. Indeed, on June 5, 2024, a report issued by the Afghanistan United Front (AUF), led by Sami Sadat, former commander of Afghanistan's Special Forces, stated that IS-KP had a current strength of 9,000 fighters in Afghanistan and could conduct attacks 'throughout the region'. AUF further noted, 'The IS-KP group has the ideological, human resources, and recruitment capacity to carry out attacks in Europe and the United States, and they have demonstrated this capability in Afghanistan and Iran as well.' Most recently, on December 12, in its propaganda poster regarding the suicide attack on Khalil Rahman Haqqani, IS-KP’s Al-Azaim media criticized the remarks of the Taliban's Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who had previously stated that anyone claiming IS-KP's presence in Afghanistan should provide evidence; the post queried, 'Do you still deny our existence?' Meanwhile, as mentioned above the Taliban killed 36 civilians in 2024, and at least nine of the 11 civilians killed in 2025. The incidents in the current year include: February 23: A young man, identified as Hamed Agha, was shot dead in Parwan Province after spending a week in Taliban detention. Agha was a resident of Bagram District.January 27: Eight civilians were detained and subsequently killed by the Taliban in separate incidents across Afghanistan. They were charged with collaborating with armed opposition groups. Since its return to power, the Taliban has particularly targeted civilians who it believed were still loyal to the former government, or those who were opposing its socio-religious diktats. In addition to IS-KP, other terrorist groups also continued to maintain a strong presence on Afghan soil, prominently including Al-Qaeda and Tehreek-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), among others. The volatility at the international borders with Pakistan and Iran adds to the Taliban’s mounting problems. Most recently, heavy shelling between the Pakistan Army and the Taliban forces started on February 22, 2025, at the Torkham border, one of the most important routes for trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The heavy firing started as Pakistan sought to prevent the Taliban from building a checkpoint near the Torkham border. The Afghanistan-Pakistan border region has seen a succession of two types of violent incidents: attacks by infiltrating militants on Security Forces (SFs) check posts/camps and exchanges of fire between the SFs of both sides over the issues of border fencing and construction of security posts. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since April 2007, when the first such clash was reported, there have been at least 26 incidents of clashes between SFs on both sides, in which 59 persons, including 40 SF personnel and 19 civilians, have been killed on the Pakistani side (data till March 2, 2025). Afghanistan rarely confirms its own casualties. Further, according to the SATP database, 415 persons (including 314 Pakistani SF personnel and 101 civilians) were killed in 179 attacks by terrorists from across the border since April 2007. As SAIR has noted earlier the international border Afghanistan and Pakistan has remained a bone of contention since the beginning. Not surprisingly, while Afghanistan continued to oppose Pakistani efforts to fence the Durand Line, which would give it permanent legitimacy, Pakistan continued to obstruct Afghan efforts even to erect check-posts along the border. The humanitarian crisis in the country, meanwhile, remains critical. According to the latest World Food Programme (WFP) data, over a quarter (14.8 million) of the Afghan population of 43.4 million were facing acute food insecurity. One in three Afghans do not know where their next meal will come from. WFP has noted that 'these figures sadly keep the country squarely amongst other severe global hunger crises. 1.4 million mothers and children are no longer receiving specialized nutritious food to prevent malnutrition, while malnutrition rates remain critically high.' The Taliban has failed comprehensively to address economic distress in the country. According to the World Bank's update released on February 5, 2025, The economic recovery has been uneven, with rural centers benefiting more than urban areas. The lack of job opportunities, coupled with ongoing displacement of population, has exacerbated regional disparities. Moreover, high levels of informal labor and the limited formalization of businesses restricts access to secure livelihoods and social safety nets, further deepening poverty for millions of Afghans. Afghanistan's economic outlook remains highly fragile with a very limited revenue base. The country's high trade deficit, dependence on imports, and shrinking fiscal space present formidable challenges to sustainable recovery, and key sectors such as agriculture remain vulnerable to the effects of climate change, insecurity and a lack of investment, further complicating the recovery process. Meanwhile, which began soon after the withdrawal of Western forces from Afghanistan, have further complicated Afghanistan's problems. External powers, prominently including China, are trying to make inroads into the country, in an effort to capture and control its significant natural resources. Afghanistan has extraordinary deposits of rare earth elements, including metals that play a critical role in the modern manufacturing sector, such as tellurium, cobalt, iron, copper, Tungsten, Manganese, and possibly the world's largest deposits of Lithium, among others. In addition, there are also significant deposits of gold, precious stones, coal, oil and gas. On February 26, 2025, US President Donald Trump, outlining the policy of his first presidency, declared, We were going to get out, but we were going to keep Bagram, not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it's exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles. And you know who's occupying it right now? China. Biden gave it up. Reacting to Trump's statement, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, denied the claim and cautioned, 'They should refrain from making emotional statements based on unsubstantiated information… Bagram is controlled by the Islamic Emirate, not China. Chinese troops are not present here, nor do we have any such pact with any country.' Despite being in power for over three years, the Taliban has failed to win the confidence and support, either of the Afghan population, or of the international community. International recognition for its regime remains elusive, despite the engagement of several countries and international agencies with the regime, both for the provision of humanitarian relief and for commercial interests, particularly for the exploitation of Afghanistan's abundant natural resources. There is very little possibility of Hibatullah Akhundzada making any changes in the prevailing regressive policies followed by his government. Absent such changes, international recognition for the Taliban remains unlikely. The internal churning within the Taliban leadership can only lead to further turbulence within the country.

Triumphalism In Moscow About Setback In Peace-Making For Ukraine ...	By Pavel K. Baev Moscow’s mouthpieces competed to celebrate and ridicule the individuals involved in the February 28 talks in Washington, D.C. between Ukraine and the United States. To the surprise of many, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the White House empty-handed after arriving with the expectation of signing a symbolically important minerals deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy’s point, 'I am not here to play cards,' echoes the same conviction as when he famously refused to escape from Kyiv when threatened by Russian tanks, claiming 'I need ammunition, not a ride' (X/@UkrEmbLondon, February 26, 2022; Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 1). Ukrainian victory in Russia’s war against the country remains out of reach, and in the latest Russian opinion polls, less than a third of respondents express resolve for continuing combat operations. Support for making concessions in order to sign a prospective peace agreement has, however, barely reached 30 percent (Levada.ru, February 28). This creates little if any incentive for Russian President Vladimir Putin to indicate readiness to make steps toward a compromise. In an interview on March 2, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov explained that 'during Donald Trump’s first election, many of our politicians fell into euphoria. Now they are falling into it again' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 2). This euphoria is due to what Lavrov characterized as the U.S. administration’s pragmatism and common sense in its approach to relations with Russia. The Kremlin was likely worried about the flurry of diplomatic activity in Washington D.C. last week, while its own consultations about normalizing relations and appointing a new ambassador to United States were progressing slowly (Vedomosti, February 28). The quarrel in the White House last Friday, however, has been presented by the Russian state and in media narratives as '[u]nprecedented in the history of international politics and diplomacy' and evidence of Ukraine being in the wrong (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 1). The Kremlin considers the exchange as reassurance that Zelenskyy is 'obsessed with continuing the war and rejects peace' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 1). It has, in Moscow’s mind, confirmed that Zelenskyy is 'the most dangerous threat to the international community,' he has 'lost his grip on reality and is unable to reach and honor agreements' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, March 1). Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s newly-promoted negotiator, described the discord as 'historic' (RBC, February 28). Russian state media have published a full transcript of the exchange, characterized as an 'open squabble,' between Zelenskyy, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance (Izvestiya, March 1). Moscow pundits have been eager to overdo one another with sarcastic assessments of Zelenskyy’s political blunders and awkward English (Kommersant, February 28). They emphasize U.S. official statements that Zelenskyy was put in his place and how Zelenskyy 'rushed' out of the Oval Office after 'Trump personally ordered Zelenskyy to leave the White House and the United States' (TASS; Ekspert, March 1). Zelenskyy’s readiness to engage in talks at the White House reflected his commitment to sign the agreement on U.S. privileged access to Ukraine’s mineral resources, including rare earth elements, that had been negotiated despite many technical issues and emotional reactions (Carnegie Politika, February 27). Moscow had been monitoring the bargaining with much concern assuming that the deal might include deposits on the Ukrainian territories annexed by Russia (NV.ua, February 28). Putin even tried to counter this agreement by inviting the United States to invest in development of Russian mineral resources, including aluminum (The Moscow Times, February 27). Russia is rich in many minerals, including rare earth elements, but many discoveries from the Soviet era, for instance lithium deposits, are underexplored, and the investment climate remains forbidding (Forbes.ru, February 26; Nezavisimaya gazeta, February 27). Offers made by Dmitriev to his U.S. counterparts were far from exciting, but the Ukrainian projects are also a long way from becoming profitable. The disappointing cost-benefit calculations may have dissuaded Washington from presenting the agreed document as a major success (Re: Russia, February 28). Instead of the minerals deal, the demand for a ceasefire became the key issue. For Ukraine, the central question is security guarantees, because Zelenskyy cannot trust Putin’s goodwill (see Strategic Snapshot, February 24). For Russia, an armistice leaves the root causes of the existential conflict unaddressed, while the war is, in Putin’s words, 'God’s will' (Rossiiskaya gazeta, February 23). Zelenskyy did not deny the problems that Ukraine is facing while defending against Russia’s invasion, yet the same cannot be said for Putin who continues to pretend that miniscule advances by Russian forces do not yield tremendous costs (The Insider, February 24). The attrition of the 'big battalions' of the Russian Army can no longer be compensated by recruitment offers with mind-boggling bonuses to 'volunteers,' which in turn would delay any further mobilization efforts by many months (The Moscow Times, February 28). As European leaders convene an emergency summit with Zelenskyy in London for a 'once in a generation moment,' Putin’s position is evaluated quite differently than in Washington (Nezavisimaya gazeta, March 1; The Kyiv Independent, March 2). The summit has alarmed many Russian 'patriotic' commentators (TopWar.ru, February 26;Meduza, March 1). This position of collective strength has not been the only show of support for Zelenskyy by European leaders, who gathered at an emergency summit in Paris last Monday on the sidelines of U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia (Kyiv Independent, February 18). These summits reflect the fast emerging determination in Europe to invest greater resources in building own defense base and in keeping Ukraine in the fight, while leaving Russia to face an overwhelming coalition in its immediate and most important neighborhood (Izvestiya, February 28). These developments have required tactical rhetorical maneuvering by the Kremlin as it has in prior years dedicated great effort to constructing a worldview in which the intrinsically hostile United States leads a grouping of obedient vassals in confrontation with Russia (Svoboda.org, March 2). This narrative is shifting as the rapprochement between Putin and Trump undercut such simplistic geopolitics. Experts in Moscow have ventured opinions about the need to modify the political discourse, but in fact, it is the whole political philosophy of breaking the U.S. world 'hegemony' that needs change (RIAC, February 26). Putin attempted to explain his maneuvering addressing the expanded gathering of the Federal Security Service (FSB) Collegium, but the usefulness of embracing the arch-enemy was far from obvious for this loyal audience of the most powerful of Russian special services (Kommersant, February 27). Splitting the trans-Atlantic unity and driving the United States away from Europe has been a long-set goal in Russia’s strategy, and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine is used as a lever for achieving this goal. The Kremlin, however, may be overcalculating the benefits of last Friday’s meeting in the White House to Moscow’s narratives. It is convenient to dismiss Europe as a disunion with no security agency, but a different reality is taking shape faster than Moscow expects. This emerging Europe is vested in ensuring peace for Ukraine, and it is up to European leaders to demonstrate that the real barrier to lasting peace is not Zelenskyy’s stubbornness, but Putin’s insatiable pursuit to see Ukraine defeated.

US Puts Firewall To Protect Ukraine Deal With Russia – OpEd	The verbal shootout at the Oval Office last Friday brought out President Vladimir Zelensky’s fury that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are very close to a deal on Ukraine, while the conclave in Lancashire House in London on Sunday involving 18 European leaders messaged that Zelensky is in good company. Connecting the dots, the incisive mind of Stephen Bryen, a leading expert on security, strategy and technology who previously held senior positions in the Pentagon and Capitol Hill, wrote on Substack: 'Trump invited [French president] Macron and [UK prime minister] Starmer to Washington to brief them, which he apparently did. The French went away fairly unhappy, but Starmer seemed to be in general agreement. Starmer made a pitch to include Article 5 and NATO in any deal; Trump rejected that appeal. Putin, meanwhile, talked to [Chinese president] Xi by telephone and sent Sergei Shoigu (who heads Russia’s Security Council, something like the NSC) to Beijing to meet with Xi. 'Trump invited Zelensky. The cover for Zelensky’s appearance in Washington was the 'Minerals Deal' which the two leaders were supposed to sign… The real reason for the Zelensky visit was to brief him on the Putin negotiations and to gain his support.' In the event, Trump could neither brief Zelensky on the Ukraine deal nor sign the 'Minerals Deal' because the Ukrainian president took great exception to any negotiations with Putin. He did this in public, to Trump’s face, and in front of the press. The result was there was no private meeting and Trump told Zelensky, 'he would be welcomed back only when he was ready for peace.' This is where things stand. The strategy session that Trump is due to take later today with his top advisors will signal what happens next. There is a strong likelihood that Trump may cut off arms deliveries and/or financial assistance to Ukraine. Now that the Rubicon has been crossed, Trump is unlikely to change course on Russia — unless, of course, Zelensky falls in line in abject surrender, which seems unlikely too. Russians of course welcome his ouster. It is highly unlikely that Trump will be cowed down by the temper tantrums of the EU or impressed by Britain’s grandstanding. Germany is without a government for the next several weeks; it weakens the Europeans’ punch. Indeed, the back channel communication between Moscow and Washington has gained traction. Moscow assesses that Trump has the upper hand. This is reflected in the growing optimism in Putin’s remarks last Thursday while addressing the Board of the Federal Security Service (collegium of Russia’s top foreign intelligence officials.) Putin began by saying that the world and the international situation are changing rapidly and 'the first contacts with the new US administration inspire certain hopes.' He said: 'There is a reciprocal commitment [with Trump] to work to restore interstate relations and to gradually address the enormous amount of systemic and strategic problems in the global architecture which once provoked the crises in Ukraine and other regions… Importantly, our partners demonstrate pragmatism and a realistic vision of things, and have abandoned numerous stereotypes, the so-called rules, and messianic, ideological clichés of their predecessors.' Putin estimated that conditions exist for a dialogue 'on bringing a fundamental solution to Ukraine crisis,… a dialogue on creating a system that will truly ensure a balanced and mutual consideration of interests, an indivisible European and global security system for the long term, where the security of some countries cannot be ensured at the expense or to the detriment of the security of other countries, definitely not Russia.' However, Putin also flagged that sections Western elites 'are still committed to maintaining instability in the world, and these forces will try to disrupt or to compromise the newly resumed dialogue' and, hence it is vital that 'every possibility offered by dialogue and special services to thwart such attempts' needs to be leveraged. Indeed, the New York Times disclosed today that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia 'as part of a larger re-evaluation of all operations against Russia.' Equally, reports have appeared that Putin has given similar instructions restraining the Russian agencies. What lends enchantment to the view is that many of the US’ most sophisticated operations against Russia are run out of Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, the storied intelligence agency that broke the Enigma codes in World War II. Suffice to say, the US seems to be cutting itself free from longstanding joint operations with Britain directed against Russia. A Guardian newspaper report has separately corroborated the Times disclosure of a shift in the US policy. It added that the warming of US-Russia relations is apparent also in certain recent other incidents which indicate that the US is 'no longer characterising Russia as a cybersecurity threat.' The paper claimed that analysts in the super secret Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) of the United States spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity that they were 'verbally informed that they were not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.' Quite obviously, a crisis of confidence has arisen in the US-UK 'special relationship' — or, to put it differently, the Trump administration is taking steps to sequester the Cisa from rogue operations. There is a Cold War history of rogue operations by spy agencies. One of the most celebrated cases was the incident on 1st May, 1960 when an American U-2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers flying at an altitude of 80,000 feet was shot down over Soviet air space triggering a diplomatic crisis that caused the collapse of a summit conference in Paris between then US president Dwight Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev — and the sudden death of the two leaders’ closely nurtured dream of détente. An analogical situation exists today. Both Washington and Moscow are conscious of it. The need for such a veil of secrecy around the high level dialogue between the Kremlin and the White House is self-evident. There are too many detractors in the collective West who won’t settle for anything short of a Russian defeat in Ukraine and would rather keep the war going. In such a fraught scenario, on the Russian side, the Kremlin’s writ ultimately prevails despite whatever dissenting voices exist in the military-industrial complex or amongst super hawks with revenge mentality. But that is not the case in the US where remnants of the old regime still hold sensitive positions, as the Guardian report vividly brings out. In the final analysis, therefore, it may well turn out that — to quote Stephen Bryan — Trump 'will let Ukraine collapse but may seek a deal with Putin on Ukraine once Zelensky is gone.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHruofv7p8eIb	2025-03-03T16:20:14-08:00	
Airstrikes: The Last Bastion Of Junta Power In Myanmar – OpEd	By Antonio Graceffo I was driving with the Free Burma Rangers (FBR), a faith-based frontline aid organization, down one of the few remaining paved roads that had survived years of war. One of the Rangers in the back of the pickup truck began banging on the cab’s ceiling—a signal to pull over. The driver swerved aggressively, quickly steering the vehicle into the jungle. Once under the cover of trees, everyone jumped out and took shelter in a drainage ditch, eyes fixed on the sky. Above us, the faint sound of jets echoed as they crisscrossed over our position. 'Before they attack, you’ll hear the pitch change when they dive,' a veteran soldier said. We listened in silence, but the attack never came. In the Myanmar civil war, every rebel knows that there are no good aircraft. The resistance forces have no planes or helicopters. So, when a plane, helicopter, or drone is heard, people run for cover. The few remaining schools, temples, hospitals, and churches all have bomb shelters nearby, as do the internally displaced people’s camps, which now house about 80% of the population. Watching the jets, which, at this point of the war are responsible for most of the casualties, it was frustrating to realize that the resistance doesn’t have a single antiaircraft gun or man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS). Government forces can fly overhead with impunity, terrorizing the population and killing at will, without any fear of counterfire. As the jets got slightly ahead of our position, one of the soldiers shouted: 'They just fired rockets.' Given the trajectory, we assumed the target was about two kilometers down the road. In any other place, in any other war, one of the soldiers would have grabbed a radio or cell phone to call ahead and check for casualties. But after the 2021 coup, the Tatmadaw cut off the internet, cell service, and electricity across the entirety of Karenni State. Thus, the only way to find out what is actually happening is to go there. We jumped into the truck and rushed to the next village, with the Rangers prepared to provide medical aid. Upon arrival, the local military commander and his soldiers were milling about in the street. Seeing the Free Burma Rangers (FBR) markings on our vehicle, they flagged us down and reported that the Tatmadaw had just blown up a school and a hospital. By the grace of God, neither building was in use, and not a single person had been injured. However, both buildings were completely destroyed. Across Myanmar, this scenario plays out multiple times per day. The army regularly bombs on internally displaced camps, civilian villages, schools, churches, and hospitals. According to David Eubank, head of Free Burma Rangers (FBR), 'At this point every hospital and most churches in Karenni State have been bombed at least once.' Karenni State has a significant Catholic population, and the beautiful churches and cathedrals seem to be a favored target of the government. We photographed the impact zones to estimate the size of the explosives, and it seemed that a crater of that size could only have been made by a 500-pound bomb. The Rangers quickly filmed a video to inform the world about what had happened. One of the Rangers stood in front of the wreckage and said, 'It’s the 13th of February. This is Dharaku Village. It just got hit by an airstrike that targeted a school and a hospital. There’s an impact area about 15 yards away from the school, which destroyed about half of it. And then, about 30 yards down the hill, there’s another impact area.' We were joking that, after the war, he might have a future as a newscaster, but then we heard the sound of an aircraft in the sky again. At that moment, a Chinese-made Y-12 aircraft flew overhead. Aircraft identification is one of the many grim skills even civilian children have learned since the coup. These planes are typically used for resupply, but they also serve for surveillance. Fearing we might be spotted and targeted for another attack, the soldiers quickly moved the vehicles off the road. After the plane passed, the local commander politely asked us to leave, concerned that we might be targeted or that having extra soldiers and vehicles in the village could invite further attacks. As we left, one of the Rangers grabbed a large chunk of shrapnel to use as a kettlebell for exercising back at camp. Even this simple act highlights how nothing goes to waste and how everything is in short supply. There is no local manufacturing, so every product, including petrol and food, has to be transported through jungles, over mountains, and across war zones. The currency has crashed, and shortages of goods and food are fueling severe inflation. The effects are especially harsh for a population where nearly no one has a wage-paying job. For instance, resistance soldiers don’t receive salaries, nor do aid workers—two of the most common jobs in the region. The area where we were working had been captured by government forces but was liberated in 2022 by resistance forces. Now, it is under the control of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF). The settlements resemble post-apocalyptic ghost towns. Although many homes remain undamaged by bombs, they are uninhabitable because the government planted landmines and booby traps around nearly every building, especially churches. Just before my arrival, a young soldier stepped on a landmine outside a church. As a result, almost the entire population is living in temporary shelters under plastic tarps. The KNDF Chairman, Khun Bedu, is working diligently with the Interim Executive Council (IEC) to establish and implement a civilian government. Various departments, such as health and education, are already operating, staffed by civilians who provide what aid they can to the people. However, because of the airstrikes, there is no way to return to normalcy. No matter what physical infrastructure or societal institutions the IEC builds, a government airstrike can come at any moment and destroy everything. Just outside of town, government forces attempted to retake territory lost in 2022. Initially, the resistance was overrun, but the next day they launched a successful counterattack. They quickly regained ground, but chose to hold their position because they were running low on ammunition and knew they couldn’t maintain additional ground if they advanced. A battalion commander pointed out that airstrikes on civilian targets are sporadic, but if the KNDF takes too much land or gets too close to government bases, all bets are off, and the government could unleash a full-scale bombing campaign. The resistance would have no way of countering it. As a result, the war has ground to a strange stalemate. Not just in Karenni State, but in most of the states actively fighting against the junta, the ethnic resistance armies have captured all but the largest cities. The capital of Karenni State, Loikaw, is largely under government control, and the same is true for Karen State’s capital, Hpa-An, and Shan State’s capital, Taunggyi. In Kachin State, the capital, Myitkyina, and in Arakan State, the capital, Sittwe, are nearly, but not entirely, under resistance control. However, in areas like Karenni, Arakan, and Kachin, the vast majority of the population now lives under the governance of ethnic resistance forces, rather than the Tatmadaw. One of the most practical differences between government-controlled and ethnic-controlled areas is the use of native languages as the medium of education in schools, where they still exist. Education often takes place in dry riverbeds under camouflaged tarps hidden in the jungle, taught by volunteer educators with few, if any, resources. Despite the hardships, their commitment to building a functioning civil society in the midst of a David vs. Goliath struggle is remarkable. Sadly, until the issue of airstrikes is resolved, this smoldering conflict will never end, and the people will never be able to reclaim their lives, nor will civilian governments be able to govern. To end the airstrikes and bring about a resolution, Myanmar needs: 1) The United States and other Western powers to prevent China and Russia from selling aircraft, munitions, and fuel to the junta; 2) Civilian governments established in places like Karenni State to receive international recognition, as well as diplomatic support and aid; 3) The international community to persuade the Thai government to open humanitarian corridors, allowing truckloads of medicine, food, and other supplies to cross the border freely; and 4) Resistance forces to receive US military aid, munitions, small weapons, and especially man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), along with sophisticated drone jammers. While many in the United States and the West are concerned about providing weapons to a country in conflict, ending the war sooner – ending the airstrikes – will save more lives in the long run.

Tariffs Are Wealth Destroyers – OpEd	By Frank Shostak On January 31, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico (except for Canadian crude oil and energy imports, which will be subject to a 10 percent tariff) and a 10 percent tariff on imports from China. Tariffs are taxes on things that Americans buy from producers in other countries. One would have thought that out of all people, President Trump—who prides himself on placing America first—would never consider imposing tariffs. After all, a tariff on any imported good implies curtailing the supply of less costly goods and encouraging the supply in a domestic market of more costly, domestically-produced goods (i.e., punishing the domestic consumers: the Americans). In his Economics in One Lesson, Henry Hazlitt quotes Adam Smith, It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes, but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage over their neighbors, and to purchase with a part of its produce, or what is the same thing, with the price of a part of it, whatever else they have occasion for. What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. Also, on this Rothbard wrote in the Power and Market, 'Tariffs injure the consumers within the ‘protected’ area, who are prevented from purchasing from more efficient competitors at a lower price.' Furthermore, by raising a protection wall to various inefficient domestic industries, Trump’s policies are going to promote inefficiency, thereby undermining the process of wealth generation. In 'The Menace of Tariffs,' Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. made the following comments, Trump said in his interview that high tariffs will encourage foreign firms to relocate to the United States, so that they can avoid paying the tariffs. What this argument ignores is that there is no benefit to American consumers in having firms located here rather than in foreign countries. What matters to consumers is getting the lowest price for the goods and services they want; and if the firm that offers the lowest price is in China rather than America, so what? According to Rothbard, in 'Smashing Protectionist ‘Theory’ (Again),' Invariably, we will find that the protectionists are out to cripple, exploit, and impose severe losses not only on foreign consumers but especially on Americans. And since each and every one of us is a consumer, this means that protectionism is out to mulct all of us for the benefit of a specially privileged, subsidized few — and an inefficient few at that: people who cannot make it in a free and unhampered market. Take, for example, the alleged Japanese menace. All trade is mutually beneficial to both parties — in this case Japanese producers and American consumers — otherwise they would not engage in the exchange. In trying to stop this trade, protectionists are trying to stop American consumers from enjoying high living standards by buying cheap and high-quality Japanese products. Instead, we are to be forced by government to return to the inefficient, higher-priced products we have already rejected. In short, inefficient producers are trying to deprive all of us of products we desire so that we will have to turn to inefficient firms. American consumers are to be plundered. Given that President Trump considers himself as a successful businessman, he surely must be well aware that the ultimate goal of every business is to make profit. Hence, to succeed in this task as a businessman, Donald Trump will not allow activities that would undermine the net worth of his company. Yet the President is of the view that this is acceptable for the economy as a whole. If policies such tariffs weaken the process of wealth formation and undermine individual well-being, obviously this is bad news for the economy as a whole, which President Trump holds as number one on his priority list. President Trump is of the view that, through tariffs, he can make the US economy prosperous. Ludwig von Mises said the following, At the bottom of the interventionist argument there is always the idea that the government or the state is an entity outside and above the social process of production, that it owns something which is not derived from taxing its subjects, and that it can spend this mythical something for definite purposes. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that a 25 percent tariff—retained through 2029—would reduce the gross domestic product of the United States by $200 billion. According to the Budget Lab at Yale University, American households will lose approximately $1,200 in purchasing power. The retaliation by countries such as China, the Eurozone, and Canada to Trump’s tariffs raises the likelihood of a trade war that is going to feed the ego of politicians. By raising tariffs on American imports, these countries will only make things much worse to themselves. What is the point of punishing your own citizens because of a misguided economic policy of the US? By curbing imports from the US to the domestic markets, one does not fix the negative side effects of US tariffs. If all countries in the world were to impose tariffs on imports, this would quickly arrest international trade and lead to massive economic impoverishment. In Power and Market, Rothbard argued that the absurdity of the pro-tariff arguments can be seen in the following example of two individuals Jones and Smith. This is a valid use of the reductio ad absurdum because the same qualitative effects take place when a tariff is levied on a whole nation as when it is levied on one or two people; the difference is merely one of degree. Suppose that Jones has a farm, 'Jones’ Acres,' and Smith works for him. Having become steeped in protariff ideas, Jones exhorts Smith to 'buy Jones’ Acres.' 'Keep the money in Jones’ Acres,' 'don’t be exploited by the flood of products from the cheap labor of foreigners outside Jones’ Acres,' and similar maxims become the watchword of the two men. To make sure that their aim is accomplished, Jones levies a 1000-percent tariff on the imports of all goods and services from 'abroad,' i.e., from outside the farm. As a result, Jones and Smith see their leisure, or 'problems of unemployment,' disappear as they work from dawn to dusk trying to eke out the production of all the goods they desire. Many they cannot raise at all; others they can, given centuries of effort. It is true that they reap the promise of the protectionists: 'self-sufficiency,' although the 'sufficiency' is bare subsistence instead of a comfortable standard of living. Money is 'kept at home,' and they can pay each other very high nominal wages and prices, but the men find that the real value of their wages, in terms of goods, plummets drastically. Truly we are now back in the situation of the isolated or barter economies of Crusoe and Friday. And that is effectively what the tariff principle amounts to. This principle is an attack on the market, and its logical goal is the self-sufficiency of individual producers; it is a goal that, if realized, would spell poverty for all, and death for most, of the present world population. It would be a regression from civilization to barbarism. Conclusion The imposition of tariffs is going to hurt the American consumers. This will stifle trade between the US and the rest of the world. It will undermine the process of wealth generation. According to Mark Hendrickson—'Trump’s First Big Economic Mistake,' In 1850, Frederic Bastiat wrote in his classic essay, 'The Law,' that tariffs are a step toward socialism. In his words, 'protectionism, socialism, and communism are basically the same plant in three different stages of its growth.' All three call for government to intervene in the marketplace to influence who gains and who loses. About the author: Frank Shostak is an Associated Scholar of the Mises Institute.

Unpredictable Days Ahead – OpEd	By Dr. J. Scott Younger One month has passed since Donald Trump entered the White House for the second time. One can only add that it has been fairly dramatic, two wars going on, which he said he would put a stop to, and the signing of umpteen executive orders including the of many MAGA supporters involved in the White House riots in January 2021. He still found time to spend weekends at his Florida base, however, and get in a statutory round of golf. The President surpassed himself when pontificating about the Ukraine war, making seemingly outrageous remarks about his European and UK allies, and having a cruel dig at President Volodymyr Zelensky, all wrong and full of misinformation. One doubts he reads anything and ‘’opens his mouth and lets his belly rumble’’ to quote a fairly common slang phrase. It must have made Vladimir Putin smile and given him satisfaction before peace talks get more serious. So far, he has found he has found routes to get away with it. A solution has always come to hand, for example being self-exonerated as president for several pending court cases to answer charges on a host of issues, including fraud. It is 26th February, Wednesday, and President Emmanuel Macron of France has been to give the European view of matters, with the war in Ukraine being at the top of the list, and the British Prime Minister will be following on Thursday 27th, separately, to endorse the European point of view and, importantly promise a commitment by the UK government to raise defence spending. Both Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer have done nothing to help, Trump said earlier! This week will be interesting to see after Macron and Starmer have confronted the President. Whatever, the Europeans are awakening slowly to the idea that their future safety has to depend very largely on themselves and the US cannot be relied on for aid unless it can be seen to be in their interest. America First!! This may be on hand. Trump, who looks at the solution to any problem like a real estate deal to be done, its profitability, never mind the people that could be hurt in its execution, has already eyed the valuable rare earth minerals. These can be found in the eastern lands of Ukraine, and are to be used to pay back the US for continued support for the war which he has said he would end. The cost to the West, which he has wrongly assessed, he has taken very much in the US favour, loans and grants being mixed up and Europe getting the short straw. He is correct, however, in saying that Europe has relied on the US too much over the years. The main outstanding issue is that Putin thinks that, as part of any peace agreement, that Russia will keep all or at least the majority of eastern Ukrainian lands that Russia has wrongly invaded, and which holds a good amount of the rare earth minerals. This is not the way that Ukraine thinks, which conjures up a with every party to give something, and Uncle Sam to coordinate and get the rare earth minerals but ensuring that Ukraine is part of the European Union and perhaps NATO going forward. The process will take several months, but the fighting and killing, continuing damage to buildings must stop before the end of the peace agreement. The sooner the better. It is a sad day when Putin would think, as he implied in a rare speech given the day before yesterday, that he would welcome a return to the old-world order of the US, China and Russia once more dominating proceedings, his interpretation of an extension of Trump’s thinking! I do not believe that is what Trump has implied I his utterings or of what most of the world wants. The worrying issue is that, because Trump believes he has a good rapport with Putin, he tends to dismiss the latter’s several serious untruths, or downright lies, which Putin puts out as the official Kremlin line, expecting his general populace to believe it, and the difficulties that would descend on them if they didn’t. Trump should note that over half a million Russians fled the country, through the southern borders, when he started the war with Ukraine, either to avoid being called up for armed forces duty or simply for reasons of disagreement with the government. Putin has had to go to China and from there to N. Korea, which Trump visited twice the last time he was in the White House, to get the additional troops he needed to give himself any chance of getting a satisfactory outcome from the war. Trump has demonstrated a handpicked team which looks like he has copied some of Putin’s play book, that is the gathering to his side a few of the richest men in the world, like oligarchs, and bypassing, where possible, the departments of government, giving them, ‘the oligarchs’, each a fairly- free hand. This will probably rebound on him rather sooner than later. Elon Musk, the product of a most unhappy and unusual upbringing and reputedly the richest man in the world, has been appointed to lead the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) with the task of cleaning up the main departments of central government and ridding them of any corruption; he is supposed to exert unilateral control over the entire Federal Government. As the British paper, the Byline Times, puts it ‘’Elon Musk’s unchecked consolidation of power over government infrastructure, financial systems, AI governance and digital media does not serve the interests of the Trump administration or the broader conservative movement -----his actions demonstrate that he is not working for Trump or the Republican Party but rather for his own power and the broader neo-reactionary agenda’’. The rest of the article is more troubling. How long will the Trump-Musk partnership last? Months? Year or two? The other war Trump has stated that he would stop is that in Gaza between the Israelis and Palestinians, or more correctly Hamas, which is ‘recognised’ as a terrorist organisation by western governments. He has entertained Benjamin Netanyahu, the PM of Israel, in Florida, from which, in a joint press conference, he promised to clean up the Gaza strip, for which he would require the 2m Palestinians who lived there to leave and go to Jordan and Egypt, and then he would build ‘The Riviera of the Middle East’. Mouths fell open at this bombshell! There are at least two things that are wrong with that statement. First, it is not in Israel’s grasp to grant Gaza; it is part of Palestine. Secondly, the people of Gaza certainly do not want to be uprooted from land which has been in their families for generations, centuries, albeit largely turned to rubble through continual bombing by Israelis. Nor do the Egyptians or Jordanians wish to absorb such a large population of forcibly displaced people who have spent the past year without jobs, hiding from nightly bombing from arms supplied by the US, just surviving with UN aide, parsimoniously let in by Israel. Naturally, the extremist far-right of Netanyahu’s government, who rather dominate the proceedings unfortunately, were delighted with President Trump’s announcement. They noted that he would be otherwise occupied in the coming period with Putin and the war in Ukraine and used the opportunity to step up the war against the Palestinians. They have illegally taken over a further part of the Palestinian owned West Bank, Jenin, clearing out the township of mostly refugees to provide space for their soldiers. They are also finding excuses to break the ceasefire process and hostage exchange, the first phase coming to an end shortly; the army is once more girding up to continue its operations in Gaza. What action will the Trump administration take? It is only fair to say that large numbers of Israelis are fed up with the strife and want to see an end to the war, which they rightly see is being pursued for personal reasons. Their voice, regrettably, carries insufficient weight, as often found in similar circumstances across the world with a government holding a tight grip on power, and not necessarily carrying out the wishes of the people. This summary proceedings of recent events has been underlined by the changeover in the US presidency, with the bringing in of the 47th incumbent to hold this prestigious office, Donald Trump, with all the unpredictability he brings. It can only be seen as a statement in time. It would be a brave man who would predict what will happen in a week’s time never mind a few months. So, watch this space! About the author: Dr. J.

What’s At Stake In The Budget Battle – OpEd	For the first time in years, the U.S. Congress is considering budget bills that could seriously rein in government spending growth. The big-budget news came out of the House of Representatives last week. The House passed its budget blueprint by a two-vote margin. House Concurrent Resolution 14 covers proposed spending for the entire U.S. government for the remainder of its 2025 fiscal year through its 2034 fiscal year. What’s in the House’s Budget Blueprint The House bill allows for up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. These cuts include extending current income tax rates at their current levels, which are set to rise after this year. Without this action, 62% of income tax filers will be forced to pay higher income taxes starting in 2026. This tax increase would have a negative impact on the growth of the U.S. economy. The cost of avoiding these tax hikes will partly be offset by cuts to the federal government’s overall discretionary and mandatory spending. The House budget bill aims to reduce mandatory spending by up to $2 trillion. That’s a big opportunity for fiscal reform because this spending increases by autopilot and is off-limits in annual budget negotiations. At the same time, the House bill proposes large reductions to nondefense discretionary spending, totaling $1.8 trillion from 2025 through 2034. This spending exploded during the Biden-Harris administration, creating the need to bring it back down to more sustainable levels. The House bill proposes to cut this portion of discretionary spending by a lot over the next two years. After which, it will resume growing at a slower rate. Meanwhile, the rate of defense spending growth would be reduced to about 2.4% annually, slower than the rate recorded during the Biden-Harris administration. Not a Sure Thing The passage of the House bill wasn’t guaranteed. The Senate had crafted a less expansive budget bill, Senate Concurrent Resolution 7, which likewise passed by a narrow margin several days before the House bill. The Senate’s version of the spending bill was adopted as a 'fallback budget' in case the House’s more ambitious budget blueprint couldn’t get the votes to pass. What One Big Budget Bill Means The successful passage of the House bill, however, now means the entire scope of the U.S. government’s fiscal policies for spending and taxes is on the negotiating table. That process is called reconciliation, and if truly successful, it will improve the U.S. government’s fiscal policies by making them more sustainable. The action now shifts to House and Senate budget negotiators, who will work to create one big budget bill on which both bodies will vote. Whether that effort will be successful remains to be seen. If it is unsuccessful, Congress will resort to its 'continuing resolution' budget game, which is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The one thing you can count on however is hearing a lot of screaming in the media about the budget bill. Especially from those who benefitted the most from the Biden-Harris administration’s excessive and wasteful spending. Their free ride on the federal government’s gravy train needs to end. The budget battle of 2025, while only just getting started, is a long-needed reckoning.

Extrajudicial Killings, Custody Deaths Resurface Under Yunus Govt...	By Zia Chowdhury Human rights activists in Bangladesh are raising alarms about extrajudicial killings and other in-custody deaths of suspects recurring since the interim government came to power. The administration headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus took office last August after a student-led uprising toppled the autocratic government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Her 15-year rule was tainted by widespread allegations of officer-involved killings and enforced disappearances. Ain-o-Shalish Kendra, a local rights organization, which was vocal in its criticism of abuses committed under Hasina, claims that at least 19 people have been killed by law enforcement agencies since Aug. 8, 2024 – when Yunus took office – including at least five in January. 'Those people either got killed in so-called gunfights or exchange of fire, or they were tortured while being in custody and later brought dead to hospitals,' the group’s senior coordinator, Abu Ahmed Faijul Kabir, told BenarNews. Shafiqul Alam, spokesman for interim government leader Yunus, issued a statement outlining the administration’s efforts against extrajudicial killings and other abuse. 'Upholding human rights in every sphere of national life is a core mission of the current government, which includes some of the top rights activists in the country,' he said, adding the government had set up commissions to reform the criminal justice system. 'Most of the commissions have submitted their reports. The interim government will hold meaningful dialogue with the political parties over these reports in an effort to eradicate every opportunity for human rights abuses in police interrogation, crime management and judicial procedure,' Shafiqul said. Yunus’ government has pledged to implement institutional reforms and put the country back on a democratic path as it prepares Bangladesh for the next general election. However, crime has surged in the seven months since Hasina fell from power, with the interim government being criticized for failing to safeguard law and order. Meanwhile, rights activists have questioned the continued killings under the interim government. In a report filed in January, New York-based Human Rights Watch said law enforcement abuses were a problem during Sheikh Hasina’s tenure as prime minister before she was forced to flee the country on Aug. 5, 2024, but they have not gone away. 'Troublingly, security forces in Bangladesh are replicating familiar patterns of abuses from the Hasina administration,' the report said. Elsewhere, A.S.M. Nasiruddin Elan, director of human rights organization Odhikar, called for the Yunus government to act. 'This should not continue. We urge the government to identify everyone involved in killings and bring them to justice,' he told BenarNews. 'We also keep eyes on ‘Operation Devil Hunt.’' Since the operation was launched on Feb. 8, over 12,500 people have been arrested. The administration dropped 'Devil Hunt' from its name in the face of mounting criticism. Leaders of the Awami League (AL), which ruled under Hasina’s leadership, claimed the arrests targeted the party. 'Thousands of Awami League leaders and activists were arrested in the name of ‘Devil Hunt,’' Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, the party’s organizing secretary, told BenarNews. Killings Among publicized cases of recent killings at the hands of police and military forces Touhidul Islam, 40, a leader of the youth-wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), died in Cumilla on Feb. 1 after being taken into custody the day before by a military unit. Family members allege he was tortured. 'There are several bruises on his body from waist to feet. There are numerous marks of torture on different parts of the body including abdomen, chest, back, legs and throat. He was beaten throughout the night and brought to a hospital in the morning after dying,' his brother, Abul Kalam, told BenarNews. That same day, the defense ministry’s Inter-Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR) announced the formation of a high-level committee to determine the cause of death. In addition, the commander of the military unit that took Touhidul into custody was relieved of his duties. In a written statement, ISPR said appropriate action would be taken if an investigation determined those responsible for Touhidul’s death, but the directorate declined additional comment until the investigation was finished. Touhidul’s survivors were not satisfied, adding police would only tell them the investigation was ongoing. 'They all promised a fair probe and action, we haven’t seen anything as of now,' Kalam said. 'We have lodged a case accusing five named and some unnamed people. None has been arrested yet. 'How long it will take, God knows.' More recently, two men were killed on Feb. 20 during a reported exchange of gunfire with law enforcers in Dhaka’s Mohammadpur area. ISPR identified the dead men as Md. Jumman and Miraz Hossain. Nur Khan Liton, a member of Commission for Enforced Disappearance and former leader of Ain-o-Shalish Kendra, noted that instead of curbing extrajudicial killings, the number had gone up since August. 'And the government is not taking any visible measures to minimize these extra-judicial killings. We have been told the same old narratives in every custodial death, crossfire or gunfight case,' he told BenarNews, adding law enforcers claim they were forced to return fire. 'It’s alarming and disappointing at the same time.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHlsgBTt-8yVC	2025-03-03T16:03:38-08:00	
India: No Safe Zones In Madhya Pradesh – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On February 19, 2025, at least four women Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadres, active members of different committees of the 'KB' division (the Kanha Tiger Reserve in Mandla, Madhya Pradesh, and the Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary in the Kawardha District of Chhattisgarh), were killed by the Madhya Pradesh Police during an encounter near Ronda Forest Camp in the Supkhar Forest Range under Garhi Police Station limits in Balaghat District. The slain Maoists were identified as Asha, the ‘KB’ division 'commander,' facing 18 criminal cases in Madhya Pradesh, who hailed from Chhattisgarh’s Sukma District and carried a bounty of INR 1.2 million on her head in Maharashtra, INR 500,000 in her home state, and INR 300,000 in Madhya Pradesh; Sarita alias Sheela alias Padam, and Lakkhe Maravi, both hailing from Sukma District, Chhattisgarh, and carried a bounty of INR 600,000 in Maharashtra, INR 500,000 in Chhattisgarh, and INR 300,000 in Madhya Pradesh, each; and Ranjita alias Ramli Alami, a resident of Kondagaon District, Chhattisgarh, with a reward of INR 600,000 in Maharashtra, INR 500,000 in Chhattisgarh, and INR 300,000 in Madhya Pradesh. Police recovered an INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, one Self-Loading Rie (SLR) and a .303 rifle, besides essential daily use items, from the encounter spot. Balaghat SP Nagendra Singh stated, 'It was our third encounter in the last 30 days. Earlier, in January, we held two exchanges of fire here and now finally we succeeded in gunning down four women Naxals. Our campaign to eliminate Naxals will be continued further.' On February 8, 2025, Security Forces (SFs) exchanged fire with around 18 to 20-armed CPI-Maoist cadres in uniform in the dense forests of Rajadera Kekdewada under Hatta Police Station limits in Balaghat District. No injuries were reported from either side, however, during a search of the area after the extremists managed to escape taking advantage of the dense forest terrain, SFs recovered a grenade launcher, a magazine, seven live cartridges, and essential supplies including rice, sugar, soybean balls, oil, and tea leaves. On January 3, 2025, a late-night encounter took place between the Hawk Force of Madhya Pradesh and a group of armed CPI-Maoist cadres, during a search operation based on intelligence inputs, in the Dharamara Forest area of Lanji Tehsil (revenue unit) in Balaghat District. After a brief encounter, the Maoists managed to escape into the dense forest. No casualties were reported from either side in the firefight. SFs recovered items typically used by Maoists from the encounter site. The February 19, 2025, incident is the lone fatality-related incident recorded in the State in Naxal [Left Wing Extremism, LWE]-linked violence in the current year, thus far (data till March 2, 2025). According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Madhya Pradesh recorded three fatalities (all Maoists) in LWE-related violence in 2024. In 2023, there were five fatalities, including one civilian and four Maoists. For 14 years in a row, SFs did not suffer any loss in the State in 2024. The last SF fatality was reported on September 22, 2010, when the Maoists killed a trooper of the Hawk Force (the special anti-Naxalite force of Madhya Pradesh Police) near Sitapala village in Balaghat District. On the other hand, SFs killed three Maoists in 2024, as against four in 2023. Further, at least one Maoist was arrested in 2024, as against two such arrests in 2023. There were no arrests in 2022. At least four Maoists were arrested in 2021 and one in 2020. 74 Maoists have been arrested since March 6, 2000, when SATP started documenting data on LWE-linked violence across the country. SFs’ success on ground has led to improvements in the security situation in Madhya Pradesh. No civilian fatalities, a crucial index of security, were registered in 2024, while one such fatality was recorded in 2023. Civilian fatalities have followed a cyclical trend since March 6, 2000, with a a maximum of three in 2021. At least 14 civilian fatalities have been recorded since 2000. Other parameters of violence have barely been registered by the rebels in Madhya Pradesh. No incident of arson was reported in 2024, as well in 2023. The State has recorded a total of 10 such incidents since March 6, 2000. The last incident of arson was carried out on May 22, 2022, when more than 350 bags of tendu (Diospyros Melonoxylon plant) leaves collected by the tribals were set on fire by the Naxalites at the Dadekasa-Bilal Kasa tendu leaves collection centre under the South Forest Division of the Lanji Tehsil (revenue unit) in Balaghat District. Likewise, no incident of explosion was reported in 2024, as well in 2023. In fact, the State has recorded just one blast since March 6, 2000, on December 11, 2001, when the erstwhile People’s War Group (PWG) cadres blew up the government guest-house at Samnapur in Balaghat District. Maoists also failed to issue any bandh (general shutdown) call in 2024, as well in 2023. The State has recorded a total of six such calls since March 6, 2000. The last such call was issued on September 18, 2019, when the CPI-Maoist in Balaghat District protested against the March 19, 2019, ‘encounter killing’ of Maoist leader Jamuna alias Sagan Bai (45) and other members, Mangesh and Nande, by Police and armed forces. Significantly, the number of LWE-related incidents fell from eight in 2023, to six in 2024. All the fatalities in 2024 were recorded from just one District, Balaghat. Similarly, the fatality in 2023 was recorded from Balaghat as well. Further, an analysis of the underground and overground activities of the Maoists in 2024, according to the SATP database, categorized Balaghat District as ‘marginally affected’. In 2023, Balaghat was in the marginally affected category as well. Madhya Pradesh has a total of 52 districts, with Maoists active in this district alone. According to a February 22, 2025, report, the Maoists’ ‘Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone’ was formed by the Maoists as a new front to provide a breather to their cadres in southern Chhattisgarh. However, the ‘MMC zone’ movement failed to take root, mainly owing to the lack of support from local people. While operations against Maoists have greatly intensified in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, Maoists have also not found it easy in Madhya Pradesh, which has often been treated by them as a ‘rest and recuperation’ zone. Coordinated operations by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and intelligence inputs from the Centre have further cornered the Maoists. To address the LWE menace holistically, the Government of India (GoI), on August 6, 2024, also designated Balaghat, along with Mandla, and Dindori in Adhya Pradesh, as LWE-affected districts, in its list of 38 districts from nine States across the country. Following the encounter of February 19, 2025, Chief Minister Mohan Yadav declared, 'there is no place for Naxalism and violent activities' in Madhya Pradesh, adding, Under the guidance of the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, the Honourable Home Minister Shri Amit Shah ji is running a campaign to eliminate Naxalism from the country by the year 2026 and our government is also working seriously in this direction. Maoist efforts for revival in the state, however, have not ended. In order to demonstrate that they were fighting for the causes and rights of locals, CPI-Maoist called for a march to Delhi on January 7, 2025, to support the ongoing farmers' stir through a two-page pamphlet and red banner pasted in the Rupjhar jungles in Balaghat District. The pamphlet, issued under the name of the CPI-Maoist 'Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh Special Zonal Committee,' read, The ongoing farmers' stir is not just the agitation of farmers from Punjab and Haryana but is actually the movement of every farmer in the country, who has already been destroyed or is on the verge of being ruined due to the anti-farmer policies of the Modi government… We appeal to people, farmers and labourers, besides allied organisations, environmentalists, and intellectuals in the three states (Maharashtra, MP, and Chhattisgarh) to support the ongoing farmers movement in all possible ways. We appeal to one and all to stage protests, demonstrations, and road jams in cities and towns; resort to relay hunger strikes; and also, campaign on social media actively. If possible, march to Delhi and Punjab with the slogan, 'Shambhu aur Kanauri border Chalo'. Similar content was also written on a red banner put up by the Maoists on a Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana sign board, in the same Maoist infested jungles of Balaghat district The Madhya Pradesh Police continue to face deficits in capacities for Policing in the State. According to the latest Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, Madhya Pradesh had 121.13 Police personnel per 100,000 population, significantly below the inadequate national average of 154.84. More worryingly, the Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometres) was just 33.85, as against the national average of 65.14. Both the State and national averages on the Police/Area ratio were well below the sanctioned strength, at 40.67 and 82.82, respectively. The sanctioned strength for the States’ Police was 125,381, while just 104,348 personnel were in position, creating a deficit of 16.77 per cent. In addition, the sanctioned strength of the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State was 305, but just 247 officers were in position, a deficit of 19.01 per cent, considerably weakening the executive supervision of the Force. According to a December 13, 2024, report, more than 6,000 people living in Maoist-hit villages in Balaghat are facing mobile phone network problem. The places where this problem exists, include Mohanpur, Chalisbodi, Kaweli, and Kasangi in the District. The Maoists are losing the little foothold they had in Madhya Pradesh. Addressing the existing lacunae in the State, and the augmentation of security and developmental would help thwart any remaining opportunities for a LWE revival in the region.

Ralph Nader: Trump’s Autocratic Moves Toward Corporate Fascism – ...	Trump has mused publicly about his fondness for Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s 'elected' dictator, and how he accomplished commanding control over his people. Trump and his loyal Trumpeteer and Musketeer cohorts are taking an American-style approach, step by faster step, far ahead of the conventional resistance. Step One is to announce that you are a STRONGMAN ruling by largely unlawful Executive Orders and ignoring the laws that demand congressional action. Step Two is to dominate the news cycle and expand your own 'news' media, such as Trump’s for-profit company Truth Social. Trump is a juggernaut of declarations, attacks on perceived opponents or 'woke' activity, and he lies about conditions in the country and the world, and more lies about his false successes. He has regular meetings at the White House with apprehensive reporters who know they are getting played, but relay his sound bites, often unrebutted to the people (such as his false outbursts about U.S. AID’s activities abroad). Step Three is to always be on the offensive and never admit mistakes or to being wrong or ignorant about anything. This puts the resistance on the defensive, reacting instead of proactively keeping Trump off balance. This tactic is working to keep the hapless Democrats still in disarray, like 'deer-in-the-headlights.' This freeze led to the Democrats’ ignominious defeat on November 5 by the most politically vulnerable GOP presidential candidate ever. The Democrats blew an opportunity to use the two month interregnum between the election and Trump’s inauguration to hold public hearings in the Senate laying down challenges on very popular agendas opposed by the GOP (to raise the minimum wage, expand the child tax credit, increase social security benefits frozen for over forty years, tax the under-taxed, sometimes zero-taxed, super rich and giant corporations, and crack down on corporate crooks exploiting consumers and workers, especially on health insurance and credit transactions.) Instead, the Democrats disgracefully took their vacations and departed with a whimper on January 20th. Step Four is to push ferociously plutocratic redirection, disruptions and suspensions of federal agencies so as to benefit enriching the super-rich like Musk and Trump. This means firing the law enforcers against corporate crime, such as major contracting fraud, and stealing from Medicare, Medicaid, and the bloated defense budget. Step Five is to redirect massive monies (such as from Medicaid) from America’s social safety net to pay for even more military dollars and tax cuts for the rich and big corporations than Trump gave them in 2017. These cuts were never seriously challenged by the Biden Administration or Congressional Democrats like House Ways and Means Chair Rep. Richard Neal (D – MA). This brazen move is so cruel that some GOP Congressional toadies are beginning to quiver since many Medicaid recipients were Trump voters and people are turning out at crowded town meetings to loudly berate the surprised Republicans. Step Six is to deeply consolidate Der Fuhrer’s power inside government and outside countervailing forces. Trump fired top military generals without cause, pushed out the chief lawyers for the three military services and replaced them with heel-clicking loyalists ready to obey any illegal order in violation of the Nuremberg rules. Remember that the unstable Trump has his finger on the nuclear trigger. Throwing out competent civil servants in agencies dedicated to helping Americans in need (Meals on Wheels, Head Start) and replacing them with clenched-teeth Trumpers now wrecking or illegally closing down federal agencies (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) devoted to auto safety, airline safety, workplace safety, environmental, climate, health protection, pandemic preparedness, and consumer protection from relentless profiteering, and protection of fair labor standards and practices. Step Seven is using the withholding of federal grants and spewing of propaganda to reduce important research and free speech on university and college campuses, intimidating and suing the corporate owners of the mainstream media to get in line or else face exclusion from the White House press corps and face FCC investigations of the radio and TV business, including NPR and PBS. Who’s left, you might say, to stop Trump, who is on the road to a deep corporate fascist state? The answer is: THE PEOPLE, taking their sovereign power under the Constitution to protest with specific demands, and to fully use the courts, give backbone to the media and launch a giant 'You’re Fired' march on Washington in the Spring for a groundswell behind Impeachment. Trump is harming all Americans – Red State, Blue State, conservatives and liberals which can bring together a left/right movement changing Congress in the 2026 elections. He is rescinding huge grants on renewable energy projects mostly going to Red States. He is canceling or suspending millions of government contracts to small business contractors or subcontractors. He is unemploying thousands of their workers every day, fueling inflation with steep tariffs, shaking the stock markets, fomenting chaos, anxiety and dread through American households and the business community itself. Will Trump get away with what he is wrecking and self-enriching? Trump and his crew of demolitionists, led by the Musk and his poisonous Tusks recognize no boundaries, no legal or moral limits. My sense is NO. This guess is based on the immediate energy, courage and smart defiance by the growing resistance from all backgrounds around the country. Time is of the essence before the next step toward a dangerous police state arrives. — A CLARION CALL FOR LARGE ORGANIZED RALLIES BACK HOME WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST THE CRIMINAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL DICTATORSHIP OF THE TRUMP/MUSK ONGOING WRECKING OF AMERICA AND AMERICANS. CRITICAL PROTECTIVE LIFELINES ARE BEING ELIMINATED IN ALL STATES – RED AND BLUE – endangering the health, safety, and economic, well-being of Americans – workers, small business, the elderly, the infirm, the children, the air, water, and undermines protection against rising epidemics and violent climate damage to communities. TRUMP/MUSK are slashing emergency services provided by our federal workers from the FAA to FEMA to EPA the monitoring of dangerous hotspots of toxic chemicals. TRUMP/MUSK are already unlawfully violating contracts and cutting off millions dollars in federal payments for small business contractors. This, of course, harms the workers in these firms. Efforts for cleaner air and water, and key farm programs are being dismantled. To enrich themselves and other billionaires, TRUMP/MUSK are cutting thousands of skilled IRS investigators focused on big-time tax evasion by the Super-Rich. There is a criminally insane takeover of our government that every day is dictating, without Congressional authority, deadly actions that amount to a dictatorship. TRUMP/MUSK are the 'an enemy of the people.' This is not what Trump supporters voted for. They did not vote for a Kleptocracy that goes after people’s programs and that does nothing to stop the hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate welfare, corporate crime against US taxpayers (such as fraud inflicted on Medicare and Medicaid), and bloated big business contracts with Uncle Sam that are now not being investigated. Saving our country from the cruel and vicious dictatorship seizing our government can only come from the people – Americans of all political backgrounds who show up and speak up at rallies, preferably outside local Congressional offices (with their Senators and Representatives invited) – rural, suburban, urban communities nationwide.. The TRUMP/MUSK overthrow of the existing corporate state, can soon become a POLICE STATE. Actions by citizens must expand rapidly before the egomaniacal, openly lying, vengeful TRUMP throws our beloved country into anarchical convulsions leading to massive disasters. The Founding Fathers freed America from the tyrant King George III and gave us the Constitution to block any future Kings. Trump, who wants to be a King said, 'I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.' Respect the trust bequeathed to us from our first Patriots in 1776 and 1783. Mobilize and galvanize NOW.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHnaW42jO4oa7	2025-03-03T15:58:02-08:00	
Zelenskyy, Trump Spar Anew About Russia’s War On Ukraine	President Donald Trump says the Ukrainian leader’s assessment that the end of Russia’s war with his country 'is still very, very far away' is 'the worst statement' he could have made and that 'America will not put up with it for much longer!' After Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in a heated exchange in the White House last Friday, they sparred again Monday from a distance about a possible end to the conflict. Zelenskyy offered his opinion that the war was unlikely to end soon as he left London Sunday night after winning wide support from European leaders for continued military assistance for Kyiv’s forces and said he expected the same from the United States, Ukraine’s biggest arms benefactor. 'I think our relationship [with the U.S.] will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,' Zelenskyy said. 'I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America' to keep aid flowing. But Trump balked at Zelenskyy’s conclusion, saying on the Truth Social media platform Monday, 'It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S.' 'Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,' Trump said, 'What are they thinking?' Zelenskyy later said on X, 'It is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest [as] possible.' 'We are working together with America and our European partners and very much hope for U.S. support on the path to peace,' Zelenskyy said. 'Peace is needed as soon as possible.' Trump has pushed to end the fighting, which has killed or wounded several hundred thousand Russian and Ukrainian fighters, along with Ukrainian civilians, but Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Trump is attempting to settle the conflict on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Russia currently holds about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory and has been slowly capturing more land in fighting in eastern Ukraine. No peace negotiations have been scheduled. Zelenskyy also said Sunday his country remained ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the U.S., and that he believes he can salvage relations with Trump. The two sides were expected to sign an agreement last week during Zelenskyy’s visit, but the arrangement fell apart after the heated exchanges with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine counts on U.S. aid in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion. 'I think stopping such assistance will only help [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,' Zelenskyy said. 'And because of that, I think that the United States and representatives of the civilized world, leaders of this world, definitely won't help Putin.' Trump cast Zelenskyy as ungrateful during their Friday meeting and had sought the minerals deal to reimburse the United States for the billions of dollars in aid it has provided to Ukraine. Trump has promoted the need to end the war and has held a phone call with Putin in addition to senior U.S. officials meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss the first stages of a potential peace deal without Ukrainian officials involved in the talks. Trump said Sunday on Truth Social: 'We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our Country - So that we don't end up like Europe!' But after seeing Zelenskyy’s comment about peace prospects, Trump quickly pivoted back to assailing the Ukrainian leader. That followed the talks Sunday in London during which British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told 18 allies that with the United States wavering in its support for Ukraine, Europe finds itself 'at a crossroads in history.' The British leader said that with no guarantee of U.S. involvement to act as a backup military support for would-be peacekeeping forces, 'Europe must do the heavy lifting' in securing peace in Ukraine. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, told reporters Monday, 'We welcome the Europeans taking a lead in European security. ... They have to invest in the capability to do that. They've certainly shown a will.' But Waltz said White House officials remain perplexed why the U.S.-Ukraine minerals mining deal fell apart, saying Zelenskyy 'could have been left with an economic guarantee that would have benefited Ukraine, and I think the world, for a generation. So, it's really confounding to us why we had kind of such hostility coming in.' Unlike in Washington, Zelenskyy was warmly embraced at the summit by many of the European heads of state, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and NATO chief Mark Rutte. Zelenskyy supporters rallied outside Starmer’s residence in support of Ukraine. As the leaders gathered Sunday, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned, 'We urgently have to rearm Europe' and 'prepare for the worst' on the continent. Starmer, when he first greeted Zelenskyy on Saturday, unveiled a $2.84 billion loan agreement to support Ukraine's defense capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilized sovereign Russian assets. Starmer said Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States. The Kremlin said in remarks aired Sunday that the United States' dramatic shift in Europe foreign policy toward Russia is largely aligned with Moscow's vision. 'The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state television that was recorded last Wednesday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHtvZ7qDHkLeF	2025-03-03T15:56:09-08:00	
Xi Warns Of Economic ‘Difficulties’ Ahead Of National People’s Co...	By Xi Zian, Qian Lang and Lucie Lo Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has warned of 'many difficulties and challenges' for China’s economy ahead of the annual session of the National People’s Congress in Beijing this week. In an article published in the ideological party journal Qiushi on Monday -- two days before the congress opens -- Xi warned of the 'many risks and hidden dangers' facing China’s economy, before alluding to the threats of further U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. 'At present, the adverse effects of changes in the external environment have deepened, and our country’s economy still faces many difficulties and challenges,' Xi wrote in the piece. U.S. President Donald Trump last month imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports in retaliation for what he said was Beijing’s refusal to stop the outflow of precursors for the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Beijing then introduced a 15% retaliatory tariff on certain U.S. energy exports to China. Last week, Trump warned he would ramp that rate up a further 10% on March 4. As a presidential candidate last year, Trump vowed tariffs of 'more than' 60% on Chinese imports. Beijing is now 'studying and formulating countermeasures' in the event that those tariffs go ahead, the party-backed Global Times newspaper cited an anonymous source as saying on Monday. 'The countermeasures will likely include both tariffs and a series of non-tariff measures, and U.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,' the paper quoted the source as saying. China’s economic troubles While they mull countermeasures, though, officials in Beijing have maintained they would prefer to forget about tariffs altogether. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press briefing on Monday that there are 'no winners' in a tariff war. 'The U.S. attempt to politicize and weaponize trade and economic issues, levy tariff hikes on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl and create blocks to its normal trade, investment and economic cooperation with China will only harm its own economic interests and international credibility,' Lin said. China is ready to engage in 'dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect,' Lin added. 'In the meanwhile, we will take all measures necessary to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests,' he said. The pending trade war comes at a time of economic stress in China. Since the start of the U.S.-China trade war under the first Trump administration, Xi has appealed for restructuring to replace exports with domestic consumption as the main driver of growth. But three years of zero-COVID restrictions and a slew of U.S. tariffs and restrictions has prompted many manufacturers to relocate away from China and spooked foreign investors. Meanwhile, widespread unemployment and a burst real estate bubble has made life much harder for ordinary Chinese. Those concerns were reiterated in Xi’s article, which pulled heavily from China’s Central Economic Work Conference in December. 'We must face up to difficulties, strengthen our confidence and strive to transform positive factors from all aspects into development results,' Xi wrote, adding that expanded domestic demand isn’t just a quick fix but 'a strategic move.' Growth figures questioned Struggling Chinese exporters told RFA Mandarin that the new tariffs proposed by Trump will further harm their businesses. The head of an electronics factory in Shenzhen who gave only the surname Ge for fear of reprisals said that the value of her company’s exports to the United States has been slashed in half since last October, and that tariffs will make things worse. 'Some taxes are paid by U.S. importers, which pushes up prices,' she said. 'U.S. importers usually pass on the costs of tariffs to consumers, making our goods more expensive.' Ge has cut the number of employees from 17 to just seven, while the sales team has been slashed from 10 to four. 'Chinese exports may lose market share to competitors in Vietnam, Indonesia and other countries as U.S. importers look for other suppliers,' she said. Political commentator Willy Lam told RFA Mandarin there is still hope that Trump won’t carry out his threat to impose tariffs above 60%. 'The 10% increase in tariffs ... is still lower than the rates Trump mentioned in 2024 of 60% or more,' Lam said. 'In general, Trump’s attitude towards Xi Jinping is milder than expected.' Analysts expect growth to be set around the 5% mark during this week’s congress, and there has also been speculation about the possibility of renewed economic stimulus packages. 'The general public in China is short of money,' Lam said. 'Most importantly, they lack confidence in the government right now.' U.S.-based economic commentator Qin Weiping cited falling marriage rates and birth rates as an indicator of low economic confidence, as young people increasingly struggle to make ends meet. 'People have no confidence in the economy, or in the future,' he said. 'So demand for residential property is naturally weaker.... It will be hard to fix the real estate problem because this is a vicious cycle.' The government should consider hiring more graduates as civil servants, Qin suggested, citing the 12.22 million who graduated in 2025 alone, swelling the ranks of the young unemployed. Xie Tian, ​​a professor at the Aiken School of Business at the University of South Carolina, said China’s growth figures were questionable in any case, alleging the numbers were fudged for political reasons. 'No-one believes it -- whether they say it’s 5% or 15% -- because that’s basically impossible,' Xie said. 'If the economic growth rate was 5%, their unemployment rate wouldn’t be that high.' But others noted a growing conundrum in China’s recent efforts to stimulate domestic growth without relying on traditional exports. Qin, the economic commentator, noted Chinese officials appeared increasingly focussed in their official documents on achieving growth through artificial intelligence, which necessitates fewer workers. Only further investment in labor-intensive industries would solve China’s problem of dampened domestic demand, he said, by putting more spending money into the pockets of China’s consumers. 'Give them a level playing field and allow the economy to get on the right track ... which will gradually solve the problem of unemployment,' he said. 'People need to feel that business is good, money is easy to make, and that life is getting better and better.' 'It’s that simple.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHu2hgJ6wVZtu	2025-03-03T15:53:30-08:00	
Saudi Opposition Welcome To Return Home: Head of State Security	Saudi opposition staying overseas are welcome to return home without any fear of punishment, Abdulaziz Al-Howairini, head of the Presidency of State Security, said in an interview on MBC’s 'Hekayat Waad' program during Ramadan. 'Under the directives of the crown prince, if there are no lawsuits filed against you for homicide, theft or assault, and you were misled, the state will welcome you and will not punish you,' he said. 'If a person has not actually committed a crime, but only entertained the thought of it, the state will address this issue and fix it.' Al-Howairini, quoting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said: 'Anyone who decides to return, without having any lawsuits filed against them for assault, homicide, or other violent acts, and if their actions were limited to opposition or they were exploited by haters or received money at some point or were misled, they are welcome to come back without fear of punishment.' He added that the Kingdom’s embassies were fully aware of the new directive, and nationals seeking assistance can contact a designated number (990) where they can provide their name and location and request to communicate with their family members. 'We receive numerous calls, but rest assured, we do not shame those individuals,' Al-Howairini said, guaranteeing the confidentiality of communications.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHt2XSO3H3KkE	2025-03-03T15:50:34-08:00	
Croatia’s Ruling HDZ Regains Majority After Gun-Firing MP’s Relea...	By Vuk Tesija The ruling Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, has regained its slender majority in Croatia’s parliament after Homeland Movement MP Josip Dabro – who is charged with violating the rights of a child and possessing illegal weapons – was released from custody on Monday. He had been in custody since Thursday due to the risk of influencing witnesses. Leaving Osijek prison at around 3:30 p.m., after all the witnesses to the crimes he is charged with had been questioned, Dabro did not give a statement. But he told the gathered journalists that he felt 'like a bullet'. He was detained after videos were leaked of him firing off a Kalashnikov and giving his underage son a weapon. His party, the DP, is the junior partner to the centre-right HDZ whose coalition government remained without a majority for four days, while Dabro was in custody. But its lack of a majority was not put to a test because parliament did not meet during that time. After last week’s parliamentary session at which his immunity was lifted, Dabro said that when he got out of prison, he would reconsider support for the ruling coalition, which holds 75 of the 151 seats in parliament. But according to the Homeland Movement, which stood by its MP the entire time, the stability of the coalition and Dabro’s vote in parliament were not at risk. Berto Salaj, a Political Science Professor at the University of Zagreb, told BIRN that the DP was in no hurry for an early election. 'Their support is very weak. They would like to show themselves to be an important factor, not just a pendant of the HDZ, but they won’t go all the way because they know this means new elections – and then they could disappear from parliament,' Salaj said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHj8jCktGlx2y	2025-03-03T15:47:39-08:00	
‘Victory, Not Surrender’: Seattle Gathers To Show Solidarity With...	Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Seattle on Saturday, rallying in solidarity with Ukraine just a day after the extraordinary Oval Office clash between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Axios described it as 'perhaps the most epic televised foreign policy row in history.' The meeting escalated when Trump and Vance lashed out at Zelensky after he asked what would happen if Putin violated a ceasefire agreement. The hostility from Trump’s team sparked a global outpouring of support for Ukraine, with many world leaders publicly supporting Zelensky. ​In response to a global outpouring of support for Ukraine following the recent Oval Office confrontation, the White House highlighted endorsements from Republican members of Congress backing President Trump's stance. For instance, Representative Pat Harrigan stated, 'America's priorities come first. @POTUS and @VP made it clear—Ukraine's interests are not America's interests.' However, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks with the party and strongly condemned the administration’s handling of the situation, warning that the U.S. appears to be shifting away from Ukraine and aligning itself with Putin’s interests. 'This week started with administration officials refusing to acknowledge that Russia started the war in Ukraine,' Murkowski wrote on social media. 'It ends with a tense, shocking conversation in the Oval Office and whispers from the White House that they may try to end all U.S. support for Ukraine.' She further expressed deep concern about what this shift means for American credibility and global democracy. 'I know foreign policy is not for the faint of heart, but right now, I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.' Meanwhile, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev took to social media to praise Trump's efforts, writing: 'The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'' Seattle Shows Support The Seattle rally, adorned with American and Ukrainian flags, featured banners condemning Trump and the trajectory of his administration’s policies. Protesters denounced efforts to strong-arm Ukraine and called on Washington to stand firmly with Kyiv in defense of democracy against Russian aggression. Rev. Father Andrii Matlak of the Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Seattle emphasized the significance of standing with Ukraine during these critical times. 'It is important to be with Ukrainians. As the world has shown its support for Ukraine, we want to express our gratitude, to the entire world, from the Ukrainian nation, from our president, and from the soldiers on the front line who are fighting for truth.' He addressed the broader implications of Ukraine’s struggle, stating: 'We are trying to bring that truth to the entire world. What is happening is not okay, and the world needs to understand that we as Ukrainians are fighting for life, not just for survival, but for the future of our generations, for the future of the entire world, and for democracy itself.' Father Andrii concluded his commentary with a blessing: 'May God bless the United States, and may God bless the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian nation.' Kimi Kinoshita, a resident of Bainbridge Island, emphasized her unwavering support for Ukraine. 'We're here because we've always supported Ukraine's right to exist.' Mykola Dolgalov, a Ukrainian living in Washington state, condemned the events in the Oval Office, calling them a travesty and a failure of U.S. leadership. 'I'm here today because what happened in the Oval Office was a travesty. That is not how international diplomacy should be conducted. America must be the leader of the free world, and an American president should never align himself with dictators like Putin.' He emphasized that Ukraine must be included in any negotiations concerning its future. 'We cannot allow negotiations to take place without Ukraine at the table. Ukraine must be strong. Right now, it is not only defending itself—it is protecting Europe and American interests.' Mykola was clear in his criticism of Trump’s handling of the situation. 'What happened yesterday, and Trump’s position in general, is not just bad for Ukraine, it’s bad for America and the entire Western world.' A Dangerous Precedent Seattle resident Tom Davis warned that failing to hold aggressors accountable could set a dangerous precedent worldwide. 'We're supporting Ukraine because if we give countries the impression that they can just grab land without consequences, it will make the world more dangerous for everyone.' He pointed to the potential ripple effects beyond Ukraine. 'China and many other countries could get the wrong idea. If we allow this to happen unchecked, it sets a precedent for future conflicts.' For Davis, the principle at stake is the right of nations to determine their own destiny. 'People need to determine their own future. Self-determination for Ukraine, self-determination for every country.' Maurice Prather, also from Seattle, touched on the importance of defending democracy and standing against tyranny. 'I support Ukraine for a very simple reason—democracy is worth fighting for. When a sovereign country is invaded, appeasement is not an option. The aggressor must be pushed out.' He emphasized that resisting dictatorships has always been a fundamental American value. 'As Americans, we have always fought against tyranny. We have always stood against dictatorships. That is what we should do—and that is what we must continue to do.' An Embarrassment for the Country Bill Bonney, who lives in Sammamish, condemned Trump’s handling of the situation, calling it an embarrassment on the global stage. 'What Trump just did is embarrassing to us as Americans. To think that this is how we are now seen in the international community. It’s disgraceful.' For Bonney, showing up at the rally was about taking real action, beyond just words. 'Coming to something like this is more than just writing a note. It’s about putting your body out there and saying: Yes, I know we are doing wrong if we don’t support Ukraine to the end,' said Bonney. 'Ukraine is helping us maintain democracy in the world. This won’t be over in a week or a month. If Putin is allowed to take Ukraine, he will find a way to move into the next country. Then it will be Europe versus whoever, and eventually, the United States will have to step in.' Standing Up for Ukraine Ukrainian-American Ruvim Burich explained why he felt compelled to attend the rally, emphasizing his deep connection to his community and the importance of standing up for Ukraine. 'I showed up to the rally because I have a deep emotional connection with my community that transcends continents, countries, and political parties.' He stressed that everyone has a role to play in Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty, whether on the battlefield, in support roles, or through advocacy. 'As an American-born Ukrainian, I believe it is every individual's responsibility to stand up for what they believe in and make their voice heard.' 'Some have the opportunity to fight on the front lines, some work in support roles, and others create awareness and bring attention to the core issues affecting their homeland,' said Burich. 'Whether locally or abroad, we all have a role to play. I came to bring awareness and to be one of the voices for Ukraine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHpep1FRUe5QQ	2025-03-03T15:43:38-08:00	
Pope Francis Had Two Episodes Of ‘Acute Respiratory Insufficiency...	By Kristina Millare Pope Francis on Monday had two episodes of acute respiratory insufficiency, according to the latest health update from the Vatican. The Holy Father was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14 and has since been treated for respiratory infections, double pneumonia, and mild kidney insufficiency, alongside his other chronic illnesses. 'The Holy Father presented two episodes of acute respiratory insufficiency, caused by significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm,' the Holy See Press Office shared on Monday. Gemelli Hospital medical staff performed two bronchoscopies March 3 to 'remove large secretions' from the 88-year-old pontiff’s airways. Though the pope’s medical condition remained stable, though complex, over the weekend, the Holy Father previously experienced a bronchospasm last Friday, which had led to an episode of 'vomiting with inhalation.' The Vatican said the Holy Father was 'alert, oriented, and cooperative' during the procedures and resumed 'noninvasive mechanical ventilation' Monday afternoon. After more than two weeks of hospitalization, Gemelli medical staff said the pope’s prognosis 'remains guarded.' Since the pope’s admission into the hospital, hundreds of jubilee pilgrims from around the world have come to Gemelli Hospital to stop and pray for the Holy Father’s recovery as part of their pilgrimage in the Eternal City.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedkLzUWPQhHh3GV-Nj_x0y	2025-03-03T15:41:09-08:00	
Europe’s Strategic Push For Peace In Ukraine – OpEd	The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has compelled European leaders to take a more active role in developing a comprehensive peace plan aimed at stabilizing the region and enhancing European security. While the United States has played a significant role in supporting Ukraine, recent transatlantic tensions have highlighted the need for a more independent European approach. European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are leading efforts to establish a strategic framework that ensures Ukraine's sovereignty while addressing broader security concerns. A key aspect of this plan is the formation of a 'coalition of the willing,' with the United Kingdom, France, and Ukraine at the forefront of efforts to create a unified peace proposal. This initiative illustrates Europe's increasing commitment to maintaining regional stability through diplomatic, military, and economic strategies, despite the challenging circumstances ahead. An outstanding development in this initiative is the current summit in London, where European leaders convened to discuss a cohesive approach to the struggle. Central to the discussions was the need to strengthen European security capabilities and ensure a continuous flow of aid to Ukraine. The strategic goals outlined in the proposed peace plan include maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity, securing its role in future negotiations, and countering Russian aggression through sustained military and economic pressure. This marks a shift in European foreign policy, as the continent seeks to assert its geopolitical agency rather than relying solely on U.S. leadership. One of the key pillars of the European peace plan is military and financial support for Ukraine. As of early 2025, European countries have collectively committed over €100 billion in military assistance, with France and Germany significantly increasing their security contributions. The UK has also pledged an additional £10 billion in direct aid, further solidifying its role as a key player in the coalition. In addition to financial support, European nations have increasingly provided advanced military equipment, including air defense systems, armored vehicles, and artillery. The rationale behind this substantial investment is twofold: to strengthen Ukraine's capacity to defend itself and to demonstrate to Russia that Europe remains united against aggression. Furthermore, discussions are ongoing about enhancing Europe's defense infrastructure, with EU member states committing to increase collective defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2026. Another significant challenge of the peace plan is the diplomatic effort to maintain strong transatlantic ties while ensuring Europe’s independent strategic direction. The ongoing conflict has strained U.S.- European relations, particularly due to shifts in foreign policy priorities following the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. While Washington remains a crucial ally, European leaders recognize the need to reduce their dependence on U.S. military and financial support. Discussions at the London Summit highlighted the importance of balancing cooperation with Washington while demonstrating Europe’s ability to take decisive action. This approach not only addresses growing skepticism in the U.S. about continued involvement in Ukraine but also serves as a strategic move to enhance Europe’s geopolitical standing. A significant advancement in the peace negotiations is the expectation of a swift ceasefire, primarily focusing on air and sea attacks. European diplomats are advocating for a month-long cessation of hostilities to establish a diplomatic framework for broader negotiations. This ceasefire is intended to allow humanitarian aid to reach affected areas, reduce current military tensions, and facilitate constructive dialogue between Ukraine and Russia. However, skepticism persists regarding Moscow’s commitment to uphold such agreements, given previous ceasefire violations. Despite these concerns, European leaders consider this initiative a crucial step toward alleviating the immediate humanitarian crisis while exploring long-term solutions. The peace plan also addresses the enduring economic stress on Russia. Sanctions have been a critical tool in Europe’s strategy, with recent measures including additional restrictions on Russian energy exports, targeted sanctions on key Russian financial institutions, and efforts to limit Moscow’s access to essential technology. In response, Russia has sought to strengthen economic ties with China, Iran, and India, creating a complex geopolitical dynamic that Europe must navigate carefully. While sanctions have weakened the Russian economy, their long-term effectiveness relies heavily on sustained enforcement and broader global cooperation. European policymakers must also address the economic repercussions within their borders, as rising energy costs and inflation present significant domestic challenges. Despite its strategic vision, the European peace initiative faces significant obstacles. Achieving a lasting settlement with Russia remains one of the biggest challenges, as Moscow continues to demand security guarantees that the West finds unacceptable. Additionally, maintaining unity among EU member states with differing views on the conflict presents a unique challenge. While countries like Poland and the Baltic states advocate for a hardline approach, others, such as Hungary, have expressed skepticism about further escalation. Bridging these differences is crucial for ensuring a coherent and effective European strategy. Furthermore, gaining Ukrainian support for any proposed agreement is essential, as Kyiv remains firm in its stance against territorial concessions. President Volodymyr Zelensky has made it clear that any peace deal must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, a position that aligns with European principles but complicates potential negotiations. An urgent issue is the sustainability of European military and economic aid. As the conflict continues into its third month, domestic political pressures in several European countries may lead to calls for reduced economic commitments. Public sentiment about the war is divided, with some segments of the population expressing fatigue over prolonged engagement. European governments must balance the necessity of supporting Ukraine with the political realities of economic strain and shifting public opinion. Ultimately, Europe’s pursuit of a peace plan for Ukraine reflects its strategic autonomy and commitment to stability. While challenging conditions remain in negotiations with Russia, maintaining European unity and providing long-term military and economic support, the current initiative marks a significant shift in European geopolitical strategy. By increasing defense spending, continuing assistance to Ukraine, and demonstrating a capacity for independent action, European leaders aim to create a future where Europe is both a powerful force in international affairs and a guarantor of regional security. The path ahead is complex, but a united and proactive Europe may hold the key to establishing lasting peace in Ukraine. The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.
