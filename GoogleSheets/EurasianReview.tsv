Rebuilding Myanmar: A Needs-Based Approach To Post-Conflict Trans...	By Harry Myo Lin As Myanmar likely will move toward a post-coup transition in 2025, rebuilding the nation requires a comprehensive and strategic approach. The country’s deep-seated divisions, economic instability, and social fragmentation call for a framework that addresses immediate humanitarian concerns and long-term peacebuilding. By applying Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs to conflict transformation, this article provides policymakers and stakeholders with a structured understanding of how unmet needs fuel conflict and how fulfilling them can foster reconciliation and stability. Drawing from successful post-conflict examples in Aceh, South Africa, and Colombia, we outline practical applications that can guide Myanmar’s path to sustainable peace. From economic justice and governance reforms to interfaith dialogue and trauma healing, this article highlights how a needs-based approach can rebuild trust, empower communities, and ensure a democratic and inclusive Myanmar. Theoretical Framework: Maslow’s Hierarchy and Conflict Dynamics Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Conflict transformation, a process aimed at addressing the root causes of violence and fostering sustainable peace, requires a deep understanding of human motivation and needs. Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, a seminal psychological theory, provides a structured framework to analyze how unmet needs perpetuate conflict and how fulfilling them can promote reconciliation. By bridging psychological principles with peacebuilding methodologies, addressing physiological, safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs can dismantle cycles of violence and empower individuals and communities. Maslow’s theory posits that human needs are arranged hierarchically, with basic physiological and safety needs forming the foundation, followed by social belonging, esteem, and self-actualization (Maslow, p. 370–96). Lower-level 'deficiency needs' (D-needs) must be 'more or less' met before higher 'growth needs' (B-needs) become salient (Maslow, p. 69). However, Maslow later acknowledged flexibility in the hierarchy, noting that needs can overlap or reorder based on individual and cultural contexts (Maslow, p. 68). Figure 1: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Source: Wikimedia Commons. Linking Unmet Needs to Conflict Structural conflicts, such as colonialism, patriarchy, or economic exploitation, often arise from systemic deprivation of basic needs. The Dependency-Power-Violence (DPV) Triangle illustrates this: involuntary dependency on dominant groups creates power imbalances, which, when sustained, justify violence as a means to fulfill unmet needs (Arai, p. 30). For instance, marginalized communities deprived of physiological needs (food, shelter) or safety (employment, healthcare) may resort to violence to reclaim agency (Arai, p. 30). Similarly, dehumanization—a key conflict dynamic—stems from polarised groups denying each other’s humanity, often due to perceived threats to their safety or esteem (Conflict Dynamics, p. 1). Figure 2: The DPV Triangle. Source: Arai (Adapted from Lederach, 2005). Conflict Transformation Through a Needs-Based Lens Conflict transformation strategies must address both immediate needs and structural inequities. Johan Galtung’s concept of structural violence—systemic harm caused by unjust institutions—aligns with Maslow’s emphasis on deficiency needs (Galtung, 2010, p. 157–188). By ensuring access to resources (physiological/safety), fostering inclusive communities (belonging), and empowering marginalized voices (esteem/self-actualization), practitioners can dismantle cycles of violence. Practical Applications for Myanmar Transitioning from Theory to Practice Applying Maslow’s hierarchy to Myanmar’s post-coup transition requires a needs-based approach to rebuilding the nation after the military is defeated. Myanmar will face a reconstruction period, requiring a careful strategy to address the economic, social, and psychological scars of military rule. By looking at successful post-conflict models from Aceh, South Africa, and Colombia, we can propose practical steps for Myanmar’s transformation. 1. Addressing Physiological and Safety Needs: Economic Justice and Stability Land Rights and Economic Redistribution: Myanmar’s history of land dispossession and economic control by the military must be addressed through comprehensive land reforms. Inspired by South Africa’s post-apartheid land restitution program, Myanmar can implement policies that return land to displaced ethnic minorities and provide economic opportunities to former resistance fighters and war-affected populations. Employment and Financial Stability: A post-conflict Myanmar will need economic stabilization programs similar to Aceh’s reintegration projects for ex-combatants. These programs can provide former resistance fighters with vocational training and employment opportunities, reducing their reliance on armed struggle. Microfinance programs, modeled after Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank, can be extended to rural Myanmar to empower women and local businesses. 2. Building Belonging and Esteem: Social Reconciliation and Healing Interfaith and Ethnic Dialogue: Religious and ethnic divisions fueled by military propaganda will require structured reconciliation efforts. In Colombia, interfaith dialogue and truth commissions were crucial in rebuilding community trust. Myanmar could create community dialogue forums in the different potential federal unit areas where religious and community leaders engage in trust-building initiatives, learning from South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Education and Media Reform: To dismantle ethnic and religious prejudices, education reform is essential. Curriculums should be redesigned to promote pluralism, civic education, and human rights awareness, following Rwanda’s model of post-genocide education reform. Media regulations must ensure that hate speech is countered, similar to Germany’s strict anti-hate speech laws, preventing extremist ideologies from resurfacing. 3. Empowering Self-Actualization: Grassroots Leadership and Civic Engagement Decentralization and Local Governance: A post-coup Myanmar should avoid over-centralization of power. The governance model can be inspired by Indonesia’s post-Suharto decentralization, where local communities were given greater control over governance. Local councils, led by former resistance leaders and civil society actors, can provide a sense of ownership in rebuilding Myanmar. Arts-Based Peacebuilding: Creative expression is a powerful tool for social healing. Sri Lanka’s Butterfly Peace Garden demonstrated how art, theater, and storytelling help trauma-affected youth reconcile with past conflicts. Myanmar’s traditional cultural arts (e.g., Zat performances, poetry, songs, animations, movies, murals, etc) can be used to create shared narratives of unity and national renewal. Challenges and Considerations Cultural and Contextual Adaptation: Maslow’s hierarchy, developed in Western individualistic contexts, may not fully align with Myanmar’s collectivist society. Efforts must respect communal identities while ensuring individual agency. Power Asymmetry and Structural Barriers: While symbolically powerful, women’s inclusion in peace talks may remain tokenistic unless patriarchal norms are actively challenged. Quotas for female participation, modeled after Liberia’s post-war governance reforms, can help address systemic barriers. Psychological and Trauma Considerations: A conflict-affected society like Myanmar will have profound psychological wounds. Addressing trauma healing and mental health services is essential to preventing cycles of violence. Programs modeled after Bosnia’s post-war psychosocial interventions could help address collective trauma and ensure sustainable reconciliation. Balancing Immediate Needs and Long-Term Goals: Simultaneously addressing urgent survival needs and long-term democratic restructuring will be critical. Myanmar’s transition must prioritize stability and justice, ensuring that governance structures do not replicate past inequalities. Conclusion A needs-based approach provides a holistic framework for Myanmar’s post-coup transition. By addressing economic justice, social reconciliation, and grassroots leadership, Myanmar can lay the groundwork for sustainable and inclusive peace. Learning from global post-conflict transformations, Myanmar’s future must be shaped by policies that bridge psychological well-being with structural reforms, ensuring a resilient and democratic society. Policymakers and all stakeholders must work collectively to achieve this vision of national renewal.

External Revenue Or Protectionism: A Tariff Can’t Be Both – Analy...	By Tate Fegley One of President Trump’s proposals for his new term is to abolish the federal income tax and replace it with tariffs as the primary revenue source for the US federal government. In a brilliant rhetorical move, he suggests implementing this through abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and replacing it with the 'External Revenue Service,' claiming that the tariffs collected by this new agency would be financed by foreigners rather than Americans. This sure sounds like a good deal. Trump has claimed that 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the English language, even more so than 'love.' Perhaps it would be if it were a device by which one could costlessly extract funds from foreigners. But is a tariff capable of doing such a thing? Standard microeconomic analysis tells us that the economic 'incidence' of a tax (that is, who really pays what portion of it) is not necessarily who statutorily collects it. In other words, just because sales tax is collected by the seller who then pays it to the tax man, this doesn’t mean that it is the seller paying the whole tax. Rather, the incidence of the tax depends on the relative elasticities of the buyer’s demand and the seller’s supply. A greater portion of the tax will be borne by the party whose demand (or supply) is relatively inelastic, as shown in the figure below. So is AOC right when she says the recently threatened tariffs on Colombian exports to the US will be paid by Americans? Not if she means that the tax will be exclusively paid for by Americans, but yes, if she means to say that at least some will be. The US is a big market for Colombian exporters—it is unlikely that Colombian coffee producers, for example, could halt all their exports to the US, attempt to sell it all elsewhere, and receive the same amount of revenue. In other words, the supply curve of Colombian for exports to the US is upward sloping, rather than flat. However, unless that supply curve is vertical (in which case, the quantity of Colombian coffee supplied to the US would be completely unresponsive to changes in price), at least some of the incidence of a tariff on Colombian coffee exported to the US would be borne by US consumers. The only other possible way that the tariff would be fully paid by Colombian exporters is if the demand curve of US consumers for Colombian coffee is horizontal, which would mean that any increase in price would lead to Americans not buying any Colombian coffee at all. As such, any tariff would have to be fully paid by Colombian exporters. To reiterate: there are only two (unlikely and perhaps even impossible) circumstances under which the incidence of tariffs would fall fully upon foreigners: The supply curve of the foreign exporter is vertical (perfectly inelastic) The demand curve of US consumers for a particular country’s exports is horizontal (perfectly elastic) A far more plausible scenario in the realm of international trade is a relatively elastic supply curve. Indeed, a model commonly presented in international trade textbooks analyzes the effect of a tariff in a 'small' country, which is assumed to lack the heft to sway world markets through its citizens’ decisions to buy or abstain from buying, and thus faces a horizontal world supply curve: In this case, the reason the importing country faces a horizontal supply curve at PFT is because consumers in the importing country have to compete with the rest of the world’s consumers, and if they aren’t willing to pay at least PFT, exporters can find plenty of other consumers who are willing to pay that price. As such, if the importing country’s government imposes tariffs on this good, the full burden of the tax will be on domestic consumers because the only way exporters are willing to sell in that country is if they receive at least PFT. Something you’ll also find in a typical international trade textbook is a model analyzing the effects of tariffs in a 'large' country, meaning that demand in that market is large enough such that exporters cannot find just as many willing buyers elsewhere. Under such circumstances (and if supply and demand curves are drawn in a certain way), in this model it’s possible for the large country to 'benefit' on net from tariffs—that is, the total dollar value of deadweight losses from the tariff in terms of losses in consumer welfare and production inefficiencies is outweighed by a sufficient amount of the tax falling on exporters. (However, this net 'benefit' treats taxpayer dollars in the hands of the government as just as valuable as taxpayers being able to keep their money.) But even in this optimistic scenario (in the real world we could not even determine whether such an 'optimal tariff' had been achieved), it is still the case that tariffs are being at least partially paid by domestic consumers. There is no free lunch. One further thing to emphasize (as noted by Robert Murphy in a recent episode of The Human Action Podcast) is that there is a conflict between the goals of having a tariff protect domestic producers on the one hand and be revenue-generating on the other hand. In the former case, the end of having a protective tariff is making imports sufficiently expensive that domestic consumers will choose to buy from a domestic producer. The more successful the tariff is in this regard, the fewer imports there are and, therefore, the less tariff revenue there is. If it is 100 percent successful and no imports are purchased, then there is no tariff revenue. Gary North agreed with Trump that 'tariff' sounds better than 'sales tax': The politicians of the national state come before the voters and propose sales taxes on goods that cross into the nation from abroad. The politicians are careful not to describe these sales taxes as sales taxes. Too many voters are tired of paying the existing level of taxes, let alone a new tax. So, the politicians call these sales taxes by a new name: tariffs. But there is nothing magical about tariffs. They are taxes and they are paid by you.

Khamenei Admits Defeat In Battle For Public Trust Among Iran’s Pe...	In a speech on February 17, 2025, Iranian regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei once again revealed his deep fear about the unstable state of the regime and the inevitable prospect of its overthrow. He acknowledged the sequential desertions and demoralization among the regime’s rank and file and dispirited forces with the phrase 'doubts about the pillars of the state!' and, to boost their morale, resorted to empty boasting. 'Today, in terms of hard defense, in terms of the enemy’s hard threat, we have no worries or problems. Today, thank God, we ourselves know, our friends know, and our enemies know that Islamic Iran, in terms of its ability to deal with hard threats, is at a high level, and the people feel secure in this regard. Therefore, our issue today is not the enemy’s hard threats,' Khamenei said. If Khamenei’s problem is not a hard threat, then what is it? Acknowledgment of Feeling Danger from Inside the Country In this speech, Khamenei said: 'Today, our enemies admit that they have come to the conclusion that if they want to overcome the Iranian nation, if they want to push the Islamic Republic back from its powerful positions, the way is to create problems inside the country, inside the nation, and inflict the people with problems and soft threats.' These words indicate that the most important priority for the Supreme Leader, as always, is to preserve the regime against the danger of being overthrown by the people and their fiery uprising. Unlike in the past, when Khamenei used foreign threats as an excuse to justify internal repression, he now explicitly admits that the real threat comes from inside the country and from within the Iranian people. His statements can also be interpreted from the angle that street repression can no longer control the deep social and political crises. The regime’s main enemy is not Khamenei’s delusions about foreign conspiracies, but the Iranian people; people who, according to him, are the subject of a 'soft threat!' due to their increasing and escalating awareness of political and social issues, and each of them, by organizing a base of revolution in their homes, streets, and workplaces, can ignite the matches ready for an uprising. Filling the Empty Bag with Government-Staged Shows In this speech, Khamenei once again tried to promote the street carnival and the exposed show of government-organized crowd-making on the anniversary of the anti-monarchical revolution as evidence of his regime’s legitimacy. He claimed that these marches show that the people still support the regime. The reality is that such shows are organized with huge expenses, forced mobilization, and threats to employees and students, and have nothing to do with the real demands of the people. Khamenei is making these statements while the claim of Jamshid Amouzegar, the then Prime Minister of the Shah, on April 10, 1978, about the gathering of 400,000 people in Tabriz is still in the collective memory of the Iranian people. The Shah regime was busy making fake crowds by bringing the army, police, and SAVAK [Shah’s secret police] onto the scene in the guise of plainclothes agents while the officials and leaders of the regime were competing with each other in buying real estate in California to flee the country. Khamenei’s main challenge is that people no longer trust official narratives. In today’s world, with the expansion of social networks, the truths behind these shows are revealed. Scenes of empty streets, pre-determined slogans, and carrying government placards can no longer deceive society. Confession to Failure with the Phrase 'Soft Threat' Khamenei admitted that the issue for his government today is not the enemy’s hard threat, but the soft threat. He defined this threat: 'What is a soft threat? A soft threat means manipulating people’s public opinion, creating discord, creating doubt about the pillars of the Islamic Revolution; this is a software threat. A soft threat means creating doubt about resistance against the enemy; this is what they are doing.' This confession is proof of the fact that the regime has become powerless in the face of people’s awareness. Khamenei knows that the Iranian people have risen up to confront the regime’s lies by relying on information, awareness, and social networks. The mentality of society can no longer be changed with censorship, filtering, and government propaganda. In order to survive, the regime is trying to keep people in ignorance and unawareness. But people are becoming more aware day by day and are no longer deceived by government shows. The widespread protests of students, workers, teachers, and other dissatisfied groups in Iran show an increase in the level of public awareness. This has terrified the regime. By carefully examining the content of his statements, it can be understood that it is not the people who have fallen into doubt about the 'pillars of the regime' (i.e., the rule of clergy and the policy of repression and export of terrorism). The people’s stance towards this regime has been clear for years. Khamenei’s reference is to the regime’s crumbling base of loyalists, which can no longer be preserved with the regime’s superficial and propagandistic slogans. A Futile Attempt to Justify the Regime’s Enemy-Making Khamenei continued his speech and tried to justify the regime’s enemy-making. He said: 'Some, in incomplete analyses, like to pretend that Iran itself creates enemies with its own hands, this is not the case.' Everyone knows that the regime’s aggressive and repressive policies are due to its fascist nature, and creating a fictitious enemy to justify these policies is an inherent characteristic of fascism. The mullahs’ regime is the main cause of enemy-making by suppressing the people, supporting terrorist groups in the region, and creating internal and external crises. The Iranian people know well that the real enemy is not outside the country, but within this oppressive regime. A Future Without the Mullahs’ Rule Khamenei’s statements reveal his fear of the future more than ever before. He knows that Iranian society no longer accepts the medieval and outdated system of the mullahs’ rule. Every day that passes, the foundations of his rule become shakier and the wave of public anger expands. As mentioned earlier, the real threat that Khamenei is talking about does not come from foreign enemies, but from within the streets of Iran and from among the people who no longer want to submit to the coercion and oppression of the absolute rule of the mullahs. This speech as a whole is an acknowledgment of the weakness, decline, and inevitable end of religious fascism. The Iranian people, more aware and determined than ever, are moving in the direction of overthrowing this dictatorship in line with the organized resistance and Resistance Units. A future without the mullahs’ rule is on the horizon.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj39xSmSumFuT	2025-02-20T16:50:48-08:00	
Speak Truth To Power…Or Irrelevance – OpEd	Back in July, in the immediate aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump and that photograph of him rising phoenix-like from the floor with a bloodied ear and raised fist shouting the defiant ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’, J D Vance’s selection as Trump’s running mate caused a meltdown among those afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. On the Democratic left, because Vance was regarded as an apostate and the only befitting punishment for apostates is death. On the Republican right, because Vance, an Iraq veteran, was the symbol of the long-overdue end of the interventionist neoconservative movement addicted to forever wars. There was a third line of criticism, which still bubbles up occasionally, which attacked Vance as an opportunist who had turned from excoriating Trump to singing his praises. He had described himself as a Never Trumper and called Trump ‘an idiot,’ ‘noxious,’ ‘America’s Hitler,’ and ‘unfit for our nation’s highest office’ because he is ‘morally reprehensible.’ The thing is though, as Salena Zeto wrote in the Atlantic back in 2016, while Trump’s supporters took his candidacy seriously but didn’t take his rhetoric literally, opponents take his words literally but don’t take him seriously. Vance’s earlier views of Trump were of the latter variety. For those who have read Vance’s autobiographical Hillbilly Elegy (2016), however, there is a natural political-cum-philosophical affinity between him and Trump. He grew up an Appalachian hillbilly, overcame ‘white trash’ origins and a dysfunctional family, joined the Marines, and leveraged military service into degrees from Ohio State and Yale. His social, economic, and governing philosophies are the result of this hardscrabble backstory. His business and political success offer a lesson in redemption that is the very essence of the American dream. Writing in the Spectator Australia on 27 July, I said: ‘Other potential picks for a running mate (who alone of the senior advisers cannot be fired) might have better helped Trump to win the election, but 39-year-old J D Vance offers the best chance to entrench the MAGA revolution in and beyond a second Trump administration.’ Vance brought his compelling backstory to life in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Milwaukee on 17 July. The introduction of his previously drug-addled and serially partnered mother, clean and sober now for a decade, to the whole nation was a fitting culmination of his life story to date. His wife Usha Vance represents another stream in the American dream, of immigrants who come to America as the land of opportunity where education, talent, and hard work are rewarded. Indo-Americans have achieved success without victimhood and grievance. Vance is exceptionally attuned to the ravages of American deindustrialisation with US manufacturing hollowed out, jobs shipped overseas, and swathes of the homeland turned into a wasteland along the Rust Belt. As Vance said in his acceptance speech, China built its middle class on the backs of growing numbers of unemployed Americans. Vance similarly prioritises the health of the US economy above the health of the planet under the alleged threat from ‘global warming.’ The commitment to reversing this destructive trend rests equally powerfully on the recognition of the importance of dignity conferred on human beings by productive work and living wages and the role of well-paying jobs in sustaining stable family life. Like Trump, Vance’s instincts are not to flinch but to go all in to turn the American nightmare into the American dream once again. His youth will ensure a continuation of Trumpism after Trump by an articulate and thoughtful politician. In foreign policy, he could be expected to shy away from military adventurism but punch hard if and when necessary to defend American interests and values. In personal traits, he came without the crude vulgarities of his boss that millions of Americans are unable to get past in order to appreciate his policies and achievements. Vance is a champion of the post-liberal right. To decry him as isolationist betrays willful blindness. He represents realism and restraint alongside strength. He has remained steadfast in US support for Israel in its war with Hamas. He questions why Europe, comparable in wealth and population to America, cannot deal with Ukraine on its own. Its military underspending is ‘an implied tax on the American people to allow for the security of Europe,’ he wrote in the Financial Times a year ago. He holds Asia to be the key strategic battleground in the foreseeable future. Similarly, Vance is no more racist and anti-immigrant than Trump. Both welcome legal immigrants who share in and commit to core American values. Both oppose discrimination – positive and negative – based on faith and skin colour. Why wouldn’t Vance want equality of opportunity for his own children? In a triumph of hope over experience, I concluded my July article with the thought that ‘Australian conservatives could do with a Trump-Vance combination whose focus is on the wellbeing of productive workers on the farms and in the factories.’ Vice President Vance Delivering his acceptance speech to the nation on 5 November after winning the election, Trump said of his running mate: [J D Vance is] a feisty guy isn’t he? You know, I’ve said 'go into the enemy camp' and, you know, the enemy camp is certain networks and a lot of people don’t like it, they’re like 'Sir, do I have to do that?' He just goes 'Okay, which one? CNN? MSNBC?' He’ll say 'All right, thank you very much.' He actually is like the only guy I’ve ever, he really looks forward to it and then he just goes in and absolutely obliterates them… We had of course seen these traits in the course of the campaign in the calm and methodical manner in which Vance did indeed obliterate many hostile media interviewers with complete courtesy but a deadly command of his brief. Trump added: He’s turned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was – I knew, I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets. And we love the family. Vance has grown into the office of Vice President. He is articulate, smart, knowledgeable and well-informed, intellectually agile, and able to marshal facts and evidence in support of the broader argument. He can respond with passion without losing his cool. A man of both gravitas and charm. Little wonder that he seems to have been given a national and international role of unique visibility and impact in the history of the office in my lifetime. The annual Munich Security Conference brings together the world’s top politicians, statesmen, generals, and corporate leaders to discuss the weighty issues currently on their mind. In a fiery address on 14 February that referenced Soviet-era language of misinformation and disinformation by the bad guys who censored dissidents, cancelled elections, and closed churches, Vance criticised Europeans for abandoning their roots as ‘defenders of democracy.’ He framed his attack along two axes, the retrenchment of free speech and the loss of border controls and national identity with mass immigration. The first is especially dear to my heart. Vance began by saying that the threat to Europe that most concerns him is not from Russia, China, or any external power but ‘the threat from within.’ The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values that are also American values. Romania’s elections annulled because EU commissioners didn’t like the outcome and warned the same could happen in Germany. Warning that ‘You can’t force people what to think, what to feel, or what to believe,’ he cited examples from across Europe of police action for online anti-feminist comments, judges saying that free speech doesn’t give people a ‘free pass’ to say things that offend a particular group with strongly held beliefs, the arrest, conviction, and fining of a man for praying silently 50 metres from an abortion clinic, and, most egregious of all, the Scottish government warning people that private prayers inside their own homes within ‘safe access zones’ could break the law. The next day, theTelegraph revealed that almost 300 people have been charged with online speech crimes under Britain’s controversial Online Safety Act. More than just talk about democratic values, ‘We must live them.’ He criticised the ban on populist elected parliamentarians from participating in the conference. It’s critical to engage in dialogue with everyone who represents an important constituency and not construct firewalls to quarantine the political system from being infected by their ideological disease. This has happened with Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Nigel Farage in the UK, and, before her election as prime minister, even Giorgia Meloni in Italy. You cannot run ‘in fear of your own voters,’ afraid of their voices, opinions, and conscience, he lectured his audience. You cannot govern effectively without a democratic mandate when difficult choices have to be made on energy and supply chain security and ‘You cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail.’ After criticising the organisers for excluding the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Vance met its co-leader Alice Weidel outside the conference. Mass immigration is possibly the most urgent policy issue confronting Western democracies. On the eve of the Munich conference, a 28-year-old Afghan who lost his asylum application drove a Mini Cooper into a trade union demonstration in Munich, killing a young mother and baby and injuring 28. He was already known to police, which is another common thread in the recent spate of asylum seeker-related attacks across Europe and the UK. Many populist parties are riding the wave of public support on the back of promises to bring ‘an end to out of control migration.’ In a democracy, ‘the people have a voice’ and ‘leaders have a choice.’ Far from protecting democracy, ignoring people, ‘dismissing their concerns,…shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process …is the most surefire way to destroy democracy.’ I wonder how the Albanese government now feels about Australia’s recently toughened hate speech law? And the supposedly centre-right Coalition parties that voted with Labor to enact it? It was a courageous speech in front of an expectedly hostile audience that by the end was barely registering a smattering of strained applause. Chancellor Olaf Scholz responded at the conference that Vance’s interference in Germany’s election was unacceptable. It’s worth repeating that Vance was born into the very types of circumstances and conditions that liberal leaders profess to be most concerned about. He delivered many telling home truths on the need for states to serve the people as active participants in the political process. Far too many countries have morphed into hollowed-out zones of discontentment run by career politicians, technocrats, and oligarchs. Instead of a distant, technocratic, and coercive behemoth feared by the people, institutions must once again become responsive to citizen aspirations and apprehensions and work with them to achieve economic stability and restore cultural identity and national sovereignty. One can quibble with particular phrases and debate the details. It’s the broad thrust of Vance’s two-pronged argument that I found attractive. ‘Free speech, I fear, is in retreat,’ said Vance. He called EU commissioners ‘Commissars’ and warned that ‘in Britain and across Europe, free speech is in retreat.’ Heady stuff! It was a brutal public dressing down of European liberal smugness ever from a visiting American dignitary. Progressive leaders habitually scold others. They are not used to being at the receiving end of a tongue-lashing. Because the EU is a geopolitical lightweight, we cannot call it an example of speaking truth to power. Instead, we could describe it as an instance of power speaking truth to an audience courting irrelevance.

India’s Dalit Women: Silent Battles Against Sexual And Caste Abus...	The relationship between sexual violence and caste in India exposes ingrained social injustices that have persisted for decades despite the country's independence. Even though equality before the law is guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, people from marginalised communities—especially Dalits—often experience a very different reality. In India, caste has a significant influence on sexual violence and is not just a problem for one gender. The victim's caste often dictates the reaction of the legal system, public indignation, and media coverage. This piece examines the widespread problem of rape in India, emphasising the particular difficulties faced by Dalit women and how caste affects justice. India's caste system, though legally abolished, continues to govern social, economic, and political life. Caste determines one's status and opportunities. The caste system dictates an individual's standing and prospects, and Dalit women frequently experience dual oppression as members of a marginalised caste and as women. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) states that a crime against Dalits is committed every fifteen minutes and that six Dalit women are raped every day. In spite of these concerning figures, Dalit victims frequently do not garner the same level of attention or condemnation as women from higher castes, highlighting the systematic discrimination that exists in Indian society. There was a lot of public outrage, quick political responses, and media coverage of the upper-caste victim in the Bengal case. In contrast, the Bihar incident, in which a Dalit girl was the victim, received little attention from the media and generated little political or public outcry. The dearth of response in the Bihar case was partly caused by the victim's caste, underscoring the institutionalised prejudice in the way these cases are managed. There has long been a pattern of caste-based inequality in rape cases. A prime example of this inequality is the 2020 Hathras case, in which a young Dalit woman was brutally raped and killed. Government agents swiftly suppressed those pursuing justice, destroyed evidence, and dropped the case. The 2012 Nirbhaya case, on the other hand, involving a victim from the upper caste, caused a great deal of outrage, important legal changes, and even a special session of the Supreme Court. While the Nirbhaya case became emblematic of India's struggle against sexual violence, it also exposed the partiality of public and judicial support. Although frequently biased, the media plays a critical role in influencing public opinion and the administration of justice. Storylines about victims from the upper caste are more likely to be sensationalised and to be reported nonstop, but Dalit victims' cases are often disregarded, with the media emphasising the 'criminality' of the community rather than the suffering of the victims. Because of the selective reporting, Dalit voices are marginalised, and caste-based discrimination is perpetuated, allowing offenders to go unpunished. The way the Indian judiciary and law enforcement operate is also influenced by caste dynamics. Crimes against Dalit women frequently result in intimidation of the victims' families, delays in the investigation, and refusals to file First Information Reports (FIRs). However, when it comes to victims who are from higher castes, the authorities tend to move quickly and decisively. These obstacles in the court system for Dalit victims are glaringly evident in the Hathras case, where authorities keep protecting the offenders ahead of serving justice.Socio-economic factors make Dalit women especially susceptible to sexual violence. Dalit women frequently work in low-paying, unofficial jobs with little access to legal, medical, or educational resources. Since they lack the social and financial resources to defend themselves, their economic marginalisation makes them easy pickings for sexual assault. Due to the combination of economic disparity and caste, Dalit women are primarily dependent on upper-class employers or landlords who can take advantage of their weaknesses without worrying about the consequences. Although there is a strong legal framework in place to prevent sexual violence, caste prejudice frequently makes it difficult for these laws to be implemented. Law enforcement usually uses the Prevention of Atrocities Act insufficiently or ignores it, which reflects ingrained prejudices and the intention of shielding Dalits and Adivasis from caste-based violence. Victims of dominant caste abuse frequently have few choices because of the perpetrators' frequent use of social and political influence to evade justice. The social stigma attributed to Dalit women's gender and caste exacerbates the psychological effects of sexual violence against them. Knowing that they are more likely to be victims of violence and not get justice because of their caste exacerbates the trauma of rape. The widespread sense of helplessness and terror that accompanies this perception of Dalit women as second-class citizens contributes to long-term mental health problems, such as elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Dalit women and activists persist in resisting and fighting for justice in the face of these overwhelming obstacles. Dalit women's rights and legislative and policy changes have been spearheaded by groups such as the National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) and the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM). These organisations empower Dalit women by battling systematic discrimination, spreading awareness, and offering legal support. The community's tenacity and resolve to end caste-based oppression are demonstrated by the increasing visibility of Dalit voices in the campaign against sexual assault.

Bureaucrats Tossing Gold Bars Off The Titanic – OpEd	During its last four months in power, the Biden-Harris administration opened the U.S. government’s money spigots as wide as they could. Appointed officials and bureaucrats across the federal government frantically spent money at a rate never before seen outside of pandemics and wars. But there was no national emergency in these months. A very different motive drove their frantic spending. For the outgoing officials and the bureaucrats who supported them, it was their 'insurance policy' against losing power in Washington, D.C. That claim was made by a member of the Biden-Harris administration who served as a special adviser to the Environmental Protection Agency. It was captured in a undercover investigation by Project Veritas and reported nearly a month after former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election. After the report, the Biden-Harris EPA spokesman denied any wrongdoing. In the weeks and months that followed, the allegation was not confirmed. It seemed the story was at a dead end. Evidence Emerges of a Wild Spending Spree That changed on February 12, 2024. The new EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, confirmed in a video announcement that the EPA rushed large amounts of cash out the door in the Biden-Harris administration’s waning days. Here’s a transcript of the portion of the video directly addressing the allegation: One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse. An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about how they were 'tossing gold bars off the Titanic', rushing to get billions of your tax out the door before Inauguration Day. The 'gold bars' were tax dollars and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden Administration knew they were wasting it. Following this revelation, during my meetings with members of Congress, I made a very important commitment to them and to the American people, which I reiterated at my confirmation hearing that if confirmed, I would immediately get a full accounting. Fortunately, my awesome team at EPA has found the gold bars. Shockingly, roughly 20 billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA. This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight. Even further, this pot of $20 billion was awarded to just eight entities that were then responsible for doling out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency. Just under $7 billion was sent to one entity called the Climate United Fund. I’m sure you and I now have some of the same questions. How do these organizations decide how to allocate funding? How much money have they given out so far and to whom? Are there any former Biden EPA staff offers who are now working at these entities? Let me make one thing abundantly clear. At this point there is zero reason to suspect any wrongdoing by the bank. Here’s my position as EPA administrator. The financial agent agreement with the bank needs to be instantly terminated and the bank must immediately return all of the gold bars that the Biden Administration tossed off the Titanic. EPA needs to reassume responsibility for all of these funds. We will review every penny that has gone out the door. I will be referring this matter to the Inspector General’s office and will work with the Justice Department as well. The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over. The American public deserves a more transparent and accountable government than what transpired these past four years. We take our obligations under the law as seriously as it gets. I’ve directed my team to find your gold bars and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps. To get so much money out the door so quickly, Biden-Harris EPA officials circumvented safeguards intended to prevent government officials from wasting taxpayer money. They were indeed'throwing gold bars' off their 'sinking Titanic.' Their actions to short-cut these spending controls gave them away. Potential Criminal Dimensions In addition to circumventing the EPA’s accounting controls, the officials and bureaucrats may alsohave tripped over other laws restricting government employees from exploiting their positions for personal gain. For example, if any officials improperly moved taxpayer funds to groups where they later got jobs after leaving public service, that feather-nesting could represent a kind of embezzlement or racketeering. The Justice Department will very likely investigate that potential. I suppose the most amazing part about the story is the original claim made by the Biden-Harris special adviser to the EPA. Their brazenness following their election loss suggests they didn’t think they would ever face any consequences for their actions. It’s a remarkable dimension in the annals of bureaucrats behaving badly.

Trump ‘Very Frustrated’ With Zelenskyy, US National Security Advi...	By Merhat Sharipzhan and Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- The White House national security adviser said that U.S. President Donald Trump is 'obviously very frustrated' with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and urged the Ukrainian president to reach an agreement soon granting the United States access to Ukraine's critical minerals. The remarks from Michael Waltz came after Zelenskyy and Trump traded sharp criticism in recent days, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and suggesting he started the war with Russia -- comments that caused concern in Ukraine and Europe and prompted pushback from some senior U.S. Republican lawmakers. A day earlier, Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would reportedly hand the United States $500 billion in mineral wealth, including rare-earth elements, as a form of payment for U.S. military and financial support for Kyiv's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion, which enters its fourth year next week. 'He needs to come back to the table,' Waltz said at a press conference at the White House on February 20. Zelenskyy has pointed out that U.S. wartime aid so far was far less than that amount and that the U.S. proposal did not offer concrete security guarantees. Trump's harshest criticism to date of Zelenskyy came after Zelenskyy charged that Trump was pushing 'a lot of information that is coming from Russia' and that the United States was helping Russia 'break out of years of isolation' by holding high-level talks in Riyadh on February 18 and moving toward normalizing relations. The bilateral U.S.-Russia talks, on the war in Ukraine and other issues, stoked worried in Ukraine and among some of its backers that Kyiv could be sidelined from negotiations and pressured to accept a cease-fire or peace deal that would favor Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron said he will travel to Washington, where he will urge Trump to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and try to convince him that the interests of the United States and Europe are in line with one another. 'I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of [Putin],' Macron said. The White House said that Trump will host Macron on February 24 and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on February 27. Zelenskyy struck a conciliatory tone following what he called a 'productive meeting' on February 20 with Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, who is on his first visit to Ukraine. The pair had 'a good discussion, [covering] many important details,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. 'I am grateful to the United States for all the assistance and bipartisan support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.' 'Ukraine is ready for a strong, effective investment and security agreement with the President of the United States,' he wrote, adding, 'Strong Ukraine-U.S. relations benefit the entire world.' However, a joint press conference by Zelenskyy and Kellogg was canceled, and there was no immediate comment from Kellogg after the meeting. Meanwhile, several senior U.S. Republican lawmakers have been pushing back against Trump's recent criticism of Zelenskyy. They worry that signaling a willingness to cut off support for Kyiv could embolden Putin. Trump's framing of Zelenskyy in negative terms stands in stark contrast to those Senate Republicans who view Ukraine as a victim of Russian aggression. They voiced strong support for Ukraine on February 19 and warned against appeasing Moscow. Senator John Kennedy (Republican-Louisiana) did not mince words when addressing the threat posed by Putin, describing him as 'a gangster with a black heart...who makes Jeffrey Dahmer (a notorious serial killer) look like Mother Teresa.' 'It is Vladimir Putin who started the war.' Kennedy said. 'I also believe through bitter experience that Vladimir Putin is a gangster…. He has Stalin's taste for blood.' Senator Roger Wicker (Republican-Mississippi) echoed Kennedy's concerns, saying that talks to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be held with Ukrainians being involved while also taking account of European interests. 'Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed,' he said. At least seven people were killed and 30 injured over the past 24 hours due to Russian attacks, regional military officials said on February 20. Targets included residential areas, social infrastructure, and essential services. Children were among the injured. After Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' the head of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, said in an interview with RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, that talk of elections in Ukraine only benefits Russia. 'This issue is being raised in order to undermine the legitimacy of the government in Ukraine, to weaken confidence in the government, to weaken support for Ukraine from international partners,' he said. Trump also wrote that 'we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia.' He added that Zelenskyy 'better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Trump’s remarks came after Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian 'disinformation bubble' and said he would like Trump’s team to be 'more truthful.' Senator Thom Tillis (Republican-North Carolina) disagreed with Trump's characterization of Zelenskyy as a 'dictator,' although he avoided directly criticizing Trump. 'It's not a word I would use,' he said, adding that there is 'no moral equivalency between Vladimir Putin and President Zelenskyy.' 'Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war,' Tillis told reporters in Washington on February 19. 'His decision has resulted in the murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He owns responsibility for this war.' Senate Majority Leader John Thune (Republican-North Dakota) also declined to criticize Trump for his remarks. 'The president speaks for himself,' he told reporters. 'I think what I'm in support of is a peaceful outcome and result in Ukraine… And I think right now, the administration, the president and his team are working to achieve that.' Although Zelenskyy's presidential mandate was due to expire in May 2024, the constitution bars elections under martial law, which was imposed when Russia launched its full-scale invasion and has repeatedly extended.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj4TrlJ8myQaM	2025-02-20T16:34:24-08:00	
Afripol Announces 37 Arrests In East African Terrorism Sweep	In a sweeping operation that covered multiple East African countries, Afripol recently announced the arrest of 37 terrorism suspects and the destruction of weapons, including a missile and antitank armaments. The operation in November and December 2024 netted members of the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Shabaab, along with other foreign fighters. Working with Interpol, Afripol authorities made arrests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania. In the DRC, police arrested four alleged members of the Allied Democratic Forces and two associates. They also captured and destroyed a missile and antitank device abandoned by terrorists. In Kenya, authorities arrested 17 people, including two suspected IS members, several foreign fighters, and more people involved in terrorism financing, radicalization and propaganda. In Somalia, authorities arrested three people, including a suspected bombmaker for an intelligence unit of al-Shabaab, who had been planting improvised explosive devices to target law enforcement officers and Soldiers. Another suspect was an al-Shabaab operative believed to have attacked several police checkpoints with hand grenades. In Tanzania, police arrested an alleged member of IS-Mozambique and a Ugandan national who tried to join a terrorist group in Mozambique. In addition to the countries where arrests were made, Afripol worked with law enforcement authorities in Djibouti, Mozambique, South Africa and Uganda to capture the terrorism suspects. The arrests were part of a five-day border security operation that used Interpol databases to search for people suspected of major crimes, including fraud, money laundering and robbery. Jalel Chelba, acting executive director of Afripol, praised the international cooperation that enabled African law enforcement to take terrorists and organized crime operators off the streets. 'Tackling terrorism and organized crime demands a unified and forward-thinking strategy that addresses both immediate risks and the deeper vulnerabilities that enable them,' Chelba said in a statement. 'This operation highlights the critical role of international cooperation and the exchange of intelligence in disrupting criminal networks and curbing their reach.' Authorities said East Africa’s porous borders, political instability and economic challenges create a favorable environment for terrorism. 'These positive results demonstrate the power of international collaboration in the fight against terrorism,' Cyril Gout, Interpol’s acting executive director of police services, said in a statement. The East African counterterrorism operation came after a separate joint Afripol-Interpol investigation in September and October 2024 that resulted in the arrests of more than 1,000 people suspected of cybercrimes across 19 Sub-Saharan countries. Operation Serengeti broke up more than 134,000 scam operations that had stolen more than $193 million from victims worldwide. About the same time as Operation Serengeti, Afripol and Interpol worked with 12 Nigerian law enforcement agencies in Operation Eagles’ Nest to arrest 36 people involved in cybercrime and seized $3 million in illegal drugs, ammunition and vehicles. The Nigerian operation focused on several types of online scams, including: 'Romance baiting,' in which scammers cultivate online relationships to manipulate victims into investing or giving them money. Investment and cryptocurrency scams, in which scammers lure victims through fictitious financial schemes. Celebrity scams, in which scammers impersonate famous figures to steal money from fans. 'This landmark initiative in Nigeria not only strengthens national capacities but also exemplifies the collective resolve of African member states to combat evolving criminal threats,' Chelba said in a statement about the arrests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj1Hj-pCc6okS	2025-02-20T16:30:20-08:00	
After Assad: A New Dynamic – Iran, The Gulf Monarchies And Erdoğa...	The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria and the resurgence of Turkey as a regional 'player' offers a new dynamic in the Middle East — and not just for raw power but for political leadership of the Sunni Muslim umma. New alliances and a rapidly changing dynamic are remaking decades old geopolitics, which up to today had seemed intractable to Middle East observers. The resulting instability, grounded in religious strife and political division, has (since Sykes-Picot first drew the 'lines in the sand' and oil was first discovered at the turn of the 20th century) fostered conflicts throughout the region. Today, that seemingly endless struggle for power is being supplanted by a new and different type of strife. The multi-party tug of war illustrates the distorted reasoning behind Middle East power politics, as regional players adapt to altered perceptions of strength and weakness, friend and foe. Persia's ancient land of Parthia (today's Iran) is reassessing the region’s politics and its position in it. The mullahs understand that the escalating influence driven by Ankara’s ambitions is towards its creation of a caliphate – a new Ottoman Empire. As a foil against Turkey’s designs for greater influence, Tehran is making overtures towards better relations with the Arab League in general and the Gulf monarchies in particular. The status quo in the Middle East was disrupted with the fall of the Assad regime. Syria’s geographic location under the latter functioned as the means through which Tehran’s influence – especially the flow of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza was accomplished. With the collapse of Assad, Syria was left destabilized, leaving a void which Ankara seeks to fill. From incursions into northern Syria and encroachment in Libya and Somalia, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has sought to position Turkey as a strategic force in the region with which to reckon. Ankara has begun to initiate a more assertive foreign policy in the region – military, economic and sectarian initiatives are now employed to increase and even solidify its political footprint. Erdoğan’s rhetoric about Turkey as a 21st century Sunni (Ottoman) caliphate harkens back to Ankara's past of imperial designs. While it is disconcerting to his neighbors in the region, it strikes a chord of empathy within various corridors of domestic politics. Ankara’s ascendency, however, is not just about political influence; rather, it has revamped the struggle for leadership within the Sunni Muslim umma. Riyadh and its regional Gulf allies have historically exerted this authority – they view themselves as the caretakers of Islam’s most sacred sites and formidable economics. Turkey now imperils that leadership; it supports political Islam and regional actors such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Gulf states view as a threat to their regimes. This sectarian competition within Sunni Islam has furthered the geopolitical divide, as Gulf states now consider Ankara more than a rival; it has become a destabilizing force within the region. The competition between the 7 Gulf states and Ankara can be felt throughout various sectors in Africa. Libya is a perfect example of this rivalry in North Africa. Turkey provides military assistance and political cover to the Government of National Accord (Tripoli), while the UAE and Egypt support the forces of Khalifa Haftar (Benghazi). In Somalia (the easternmost country in continental Africa) which Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi consider critical to their own security interests, Ankara’s presence and influence continues to evolve concern from them. The cautious relationship between Ankara and the Gulf monarchs is evident through Turkey's previous (2017) rapid intervention in support of Qatar during the Gulf states sanctions on the latter. Over the last decade, Tehran’s attempts to have its political power respected in the region has put it at cross purposes (politically and militarily) with the Gulf states. Today, Iran is reassessing how it will pursue regional power to check Ankara's moves while mollifying the monarchs. It is cautiously reevaluating its way forward. It seems that Iran realizes the value of 'Realpolitik' (pragmatism) as it works its way through the political and sectarian minefields ever present when navigating between the Gulf states and Ankara. Pivotal to these efforts is the recent detente between Iran and Riyadh, revealing Tehran’s desire to mitigate tensions with its Gulf neighbors. Such actions between the two adversaries demonstrate their mutual concern with Ankara’s regional ambitions. Turkey’s more aggressive behavior in Syria and Libya could even precipitate the Gulf monarchies to seek 'arrangements' with Israel (like the Abraham Accords) or the US – especially now that a cease-fire with Gaza has occurred and Trump is in the White House. Relationships with Europe have proven, historically, to be of little value to regional stability. The Gulf states will attempt to balance the increasing concerns posed by Turkey while being vigilant against the problems of their historical nemesis, Iran. In particular they must strengthen political and military alliances if they are to maintain their relative positions within the region vis-a-vis Erdoğan’s ambitions. The U.S., for its part, appears to be pivoting towards Southeast Asia – the Pacific Rim. This creates an opportunity in the Middle East for regional powers like Turkey to magnify its role. At the same time, China and Russia are carefully insinuating themselves into this new regional hierarchy. Russia’s relationship with Iran and Turkey, while pragmatic, could encounter headwinds if their interests clash in the yet to be determined politics of Syria. China is strengthening relationships with both Iran and the Gulf states; it hopes to obtain much needed energy flows and expand its relatively 'no-strings-attached' infrastructure-development approach to its politics. As the dynamics between Iran, Turkey and the Gulf develop, one question presents itself: Will 'Realpolitik' prevail through innovative diplomatic discourse or will history (again) repeat itself – promises broken, alliances breached with renewed mistrust leading, inevitably, to further military interventions – and another status quo of instability?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj1nDZfY58bKN	2025-02-20T16:21:45-08:00	
Foreign Direct Investment Increased To A Record $41 Trillion – Op...	Global foreign direct investment grew again in 2023 after declining the previous year. Inward direct investment climbed $1.75 trillion, or 4.4 percent, reaching a record $41 trillion, according to the IMF’s latest Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, which provides detailed information on direct investment positions between countries. FDI rose in most regions, with Central and South Asia, Europe, and North and Central America contributing most. Direct investment between advanced economies grew by $880 billion, or 3.6 percent, while those from advanced economies to emerging market and developing economies rose by $538 billion, or 7.6 percent. As our Chart of the Week shows, the United States extended its lead as the top destination for direct investment. Singapore recorded the largest gain in 2023, with its position rising $307 billion, followed by $227 billion for the United States and $164 billion for Germany. Meanwhile, the Netherlands and Luxembourg posted the steepest declines but remained in the top five, alongside the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Strong growth was also seen in many emerging economies. Most notably, India, Mexico, and Brazil each saw their inward direct investment positions rise by around $130 billion or about 20 percent, marking the largest increase for these three economies in total since the survey began in 2009.

Russia-US Meeting In Riyadh More Than An Icebreaker – OpEd	By Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg The meeting held in Riyadh on Tuesday has turned out to be more than an icebreaker. It was already significant as the first high-level meeting between Russia and the US since January 2022, when former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Geneva, a few weeks before the war broke out, but they failed to avert it. By contrast the outcomes of the Riyadh meeting went beyond expectations. It took place in the offices of Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry and lasted more than four hours. The fact that it was held in the Kingdom showcases the country’s diplomatic credentials and its efforts to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine. In a statement issued earlier this month, Saudi Arabia recalled that those efforts began at the start of the Ukraine crisis. This was when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called both President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 3, 2022, to offer the Kingdom’s good offices to reach a political solution. After the Riyadh meeting, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Kingdom was playing an 'indispensable role' by bringing the parties together, expressing hope that it would continue this effort. At the Tuesday meeting, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan facilitated the talks together with National Security Advisor Dr. Musaad Al-Aiban, the seasoned minister who is described as the man for difficult missions. On the US side there was also a high-powered team led by Rubio, a former senator, on his first trip to Saudi Arabia. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who is also a former lawmaker from Florida, was on the team. Probably the closest to President Donald Trump was his Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, a real estate magnate known for successful dealmaking. Outside of family, there is no one more trusted by Trump as Witkoff, CNN has reported. He was instrumental in getting the Israel-Hamas deal done even before Trump took office and his remit has now expanded to the Russia-Ukraine war. Lavrov, the veteran diplomat since the days of the USSR, led the Russian side, together with Kirill Dmitriev, who was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, studied at Harvard Business School, and began his career with stints at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Company. He has managed large private equity funds and completed a series of landmark transactions for Russia. He now heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund and is a confidante of Putin. Following the meeting, Rubio said they agreed on four points. Firstly, to re-establish the 'functionality of our respective missions in Washington and in Moscow,' to facilitate progress. Secondly, the appointment of a high-level team to help negotiate an end to the conflict in Ukraine 'in a way that’s enduring and acceptable to all the parties engaged.' Thirdly, to begin to discuss both the geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from an end to the conflict in Ukraine. Fourthly, they agreed to remain engaged at the same high level to 'make sure that it’s moving along in a productive way,' Rubio said. Waltz stressed the need for a permanent and quick end to the war, which has 'turned into a meat grinder of people on both sides,' revealing that as a 'practical reality,' there was going to be some discussion of territory, not ruling out possible concessions. Rubio indicated there would be sanctions relief. Witkoff described the talks as 'positive, upbeat, constructive … solution-based.' He added: 'We couldn’t have imagined a better result after this session. It was very, very solid.' The Riyadh meeting came just a week after Trump spoke to Putin telephonically. And Lavrov said after the talks the sides agreed to fast-track the appointment of new ambassadors and 'lifting artificial barriers to the work of the US and Russian embassies and other missions.' The two sides agreed to set up high-level working groups to begin exploring a negotiated end to the conflict. It was not immediately clear when these teams would first meet, but both said it would be soon. For the main objective of this effort — ending the war — a high-level team from the two countries will begin to engage with the Russian side on 'parameters of what an end to this conflict would look like.' On the idea of a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, Lavrov said Moscow would not accept any troops from NATO members, stressing that Ukraine’s bid to join the alliance was a major security issue. Lavrov said: 'We explained that the deployment of troops from the countries that are NATO members, even if they are deployed under the EU or national flags, will not change anything and will certainly be unacceptable for us.' But he seemed to imply the possibility of a UN force. The presence of Witkoff and Dmitriev at the Riyadh talks is indicative of the two sides’ ambition to move from the current crisis to a close economic relationship. Dmitriev told reporters that Russia and the US should develop joint energy and other ventures, including in the Arctic and other regions. And Rubio said that once the Ukraine conflict was brought to an end, it could open 'incredible opportunities' to partner with Russia 'on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.' Realistically, there could be difficult hurdles before these ambitious ideas materialize. First, the US needs to persuade Zelensky and its NATO and EU allies of the value of its diplomatic approach to the crisis. Aware of this need, Rubio said: 'There’s going to be engagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe, and others. He did not specify dates but remarked that Trump was 'not patient in terms of getting action. 'He drives. He drives hard. He wants to get things done. He’s been wanting to do this, and he’s moving very quickly.' - Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg is the GCC assistant secretary-general for political affairs and negotiation.

Eight Ways Trump Can Tank The Economy – OpEd	President Biden handed off the best economy to an incoming president since at least the 2001 handoff from Clinton to Bush II. In his last quarter in office, GDP grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate (final demand, which excludes inventory fluctuations, grew at a 3.2 percent rate). That brought the average growth rate for Biden’s presidency to 3.2 percent, the highest since Clinton’s second term. The unemployment rate fell to 4.0 percent in January, keeping it in the narrow band between 4.0 percent and 4.3 percent it has been in since last May. For Biden’s whole term the unemployment rate averaged 4.1 percent, the lowest since Johnson’s last term, more than half a century ago. Inflation is still slightly above the Fed’s 2.0 percent target, but it shows no clear trend. It’s worth noting in this respect that below 2.0 percent inflation rates were largely a post-Great Recession story. Prior to the Great Recession, inflation generally ran somewhat about 2.0 percent. Inflation, as measured by the CPI, was 3.4 percent in 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration. In addition, productivity growth has been unexpectedly fast, running at close to a 2.0 percent rate in the last year. And these productivity gains are being passed on in rising real wages, with workers across the wage ladder getting their share of productivity growth. This translates into an extraordinarily good economic picture, but we know that Donald Trump has big plans for the economy. Given his bold pronouncements coming daily, or even hourly, he has many possible routes for ending the boom we have been seeing. Here are my eight favorite economy wreckers, in no particular order: 1.) Stock market crash, 2.) Mass deportation, 3.) Tariffs run wild, 4.) Pandemic wipe out, 5.) Global warming disasters, 6.) Splurge of spending cuts, 7.) Debt limit crisis, 8.) Messing with economic data. It is not entirely accurate for me to say there is no order. I do think a stock market crash is by far the likeliest way that the economy gets derailed. I should also say that a crash would not necessarily be Trump’s fault. If we have a bubble, as I strongly suspect, then it is likely something will burst it, even if we had competent people setting economic policy. However, after the prospect of a stock crash, my views on the likelihood of the other dangers changes by the hour, or even the minute, as some new craziness spews out of Donald Trump or Elon Musk’s mouth or social media feed. Rather than making an arbitrary, as of this minute, ordering, I’m just going to say that the other seven are equally likely. I’ll quickly go through each in turn. Stock Market Crash The story here is straightforward. The price-to-earnings ratios in the stock market are near their 1990s bubble peak, even as most projections are that real profits will grow slowly over the next decade. This implies that either the profit projections are grossly understated, that price-to-earnings ratio will go even higher, people are willing to invest in stocks for returns only slightly higher than what they can get from bonds, or the market is likely to crash. I’m inclined to think that the crash is the most plausible scenario, but I could be wrong. It is worth correcting an important error on this one. Clearly the highest PEs can be found on AI-related tech states, but the market as a whole is likely over-valued, even if it might be by a smaller amount. If we go back to the 1990s, people often referred to the soaring stock market as a tech bubble. The tech stocks were the ones that took the largest hits when the market did crash, but even the stock of companies like GM and McDonalds lost close to half its value. So, the bubble was much more broadly based than just the tech companies. I would speculate that there is a similar story today. The AI companies might well take the biggest hit in a stock market crash, but a much wider set of companies is likely to be affected. (For an especially pessimistic assessment of the prospects for AI and the tech companies listen to this On the Media segment.) A plunge in the stock market will have two effects. First, it can destroy tens of trillions of dollars of wealth. People who thought they had plenty of money in their 401(k)s for retirement suddenly find out otherwise. This is likely to lead to major cutbacks in spending, especially for those who are near retirement or have recently retired. The other effect is likely to be a hit to investment. The companies that are now throwing money indiscriminately at everything related to AI will suddenly be more careful to only spend in areas where they can reasonably expect to see a payback in the not-too-distant future. It is also worth correcting a common misunderstanding about the stock crash recession in 2001. From a GDP standpoint this looks like a very short and mild recession. We did not even see the traditional two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. However, we get an opposite picture from a labor market perspective. Employment peaked before the recession in February of 2021. We didn’t get back to this same level of employment for four full years. At the time, this was the longest period without job growth since the Great Depression. It is wrong to think of this as a short and mild recession. Mass Deportation Sends Prices Soaring The biggest uncertainty with mass deportation is whether we will actually see it. While the call for mass deportation was central to Trump’s campaign, the reality of recent immigration bears almost no resemblance to the tales of drug dealers, rapists, and murderers overrunning our borders, and many people around Trump know this. The simple fact is that the overwhelming majority of recent immigrants came here to work. They take physically demanding low-paying jobs that few native-born workers would want. If a large share of them were rounded up and thrown out of the country, we would see massive labor shortages in large sectors of the economy. This would be most apparent in agriculture, where estimates put the share of undocumented workers as high as 45 percent. However, a large share of workers in food processing, construction, and a number of other industries are undocumented. If we see mass deportations, it is a safe bet food prices will rise considerably, and construction will slow. This will mean a boost to inflation and a reduction in people’s purchasing power. If the Fed responds to higher inflation by raising rates, this will further weaken the housing sector and slow demand through other channels. It’s worth noting that even a Trump controlled Fed may not be able to keep long-term rates from rising, unless it is prepared to engage in highly unorthodox monetary policy. The end story here is that we get a recession. This again could be a long one, depending on how many people get deported, as the economy eventually adjusts to having a considerably smaller workforce. Tariffs Flow Like Water Donald Trump seems to really like tariffs and also have no idea what they are. As much as Trump likes to talk about imposing tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico or whatever other villain of the moment appears in his sights, he actually is imposing a tax on us, on the goods we import from these countries. We pay the tariff, not the bad actor in Trump’s tough guy warnings. Higher import taxes raise the price of imports in the same way that a tax on barrels of oil leads to higher gas prices at the pump. Depending on how many goods get subject to the tax, and the actual tax rate, we could end up paying out a lot of money to cover the cost of Trump’s tariffs. As a simple approximation, our goods imports come to roughly $4 trillion a year or 13 percent of GDP. If we imposed an import tax of 20 percent, we would be paying $800 billion a year ($6,000 a family) as a result of the tariffs. (This assumes no reduction in imports, which clearly would not be the case.) As with mass deportations, this would directly push inflation higher, in addition to pulling money out of our pockets. If the Fed raised rates in response, we again would face a serious risk of recession. Here also we get very mixed signals from the administration. He threatened 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but then walked the threat back before the tariffs actually took effect. However, he did go through with 20 percent tariffs on aluminum and steel. There are clearly people in the administration who know that major tariff hikes will be bad news for the economy, and even more immediately the stock market. It would take someone with more inside knowledge than me to know whether a tariff hungry Trump or a more reasonable advisor is likely to determine policy. It is also worth noting that running economic policy like a TV game show does have a cost. Businesses like predictability when they look to make investment decisions. If they are trying to decide on expanding their capacity, it matters hugely whether items coming in from Canada and Mexico are mostly tariff free, or whether the U.S. is imposing large taxes. At the very least, the TV game show approach to economic policy is likely to delay some investments as businesses try to determine the ultimate course Trump will take. Pandemic II This one is totally speculative both since I have very little knowledge of epidemiology and also because the future course of prospective pandemics would be guesswork by anyone. There are a couple of things we can say. First, there are always various diseases being spread among domesticated animals as well as wildlife. For the most part, these diseases pose little risk to humans, but that can always change as a result of new mutations. This raises the second point, the Trump-Musk team have eviscerated our public health agencies so that they will be far less prepared to deal with any major threats to humans that might arise. (They have already delayed the circulation of a report on the spread of bird flu for no obvious reason.) The economic consequences of this tampering with the public health agencies is most likely to take the form of higher prices for eggs, meat, and chicken. This would also mean somewhat higher inflation, but probably not the sort of stuff that leads to big interest rate hikes and a recession. There is the risk that these viruses will spread to people, as has already been the case to a limited extent. This is bad news from a public health perspective, but not likely a major economic calamity unless a strain proves to be both highly contagious and also to pose a severe health risk. Based on my very limited knowledge, that seems unlikely, but the risk is surely higher with Elon Musk’s 'super-high IQ' DOGE boys calling the shots instead of people who actually understand the issues involved. Global Warming Disaster or LA Fire Sequel We have been seeing many more extreme climate events in recent years as a result of global warming. Trump has doubled down on a commitment to do everything he can to advance global warming as much as possible. He wants to eliminate all the Biden and Obama programs to promote EVs and clean energy, and to subsidize the use of fossil fuels. This is horrible from the standpoint of saving the planet, but fortunately Chinaand much of the rest of the world are moving aggressively to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the immediate issue from the standpoint of the economy is the damage to the environment that is already baked into the cards from past emissions. This should require us to take steps towards both mitigating potential damage and enhanced emergency preparation for the increasingly intense hurricanes, floods, and wildfires that we will see. This is not going to happen, both because of Trump’s determination to pretend global warming is not real, and also because he is firing most of the people competent to lead this effort. His efforts to punish people who didn’t vote for him are also likely to increase the economic damage from global warming. In terms of mitigation, we should be discouraging people from building in areas that are especially prone to damage from floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. There are some efforts at the state level to do this, but it’s a safe bet the Trump administration will not be encouraging it. Also, it is actively trying to destroy the agencies that gather the information that would facilitate this process. Private insurers actually would assist in this process, if regulators allow them. This is not out of benevolence, it’s simply due to the fact that they don’t want to insure a home that is likely to be destroyed in a wildfire or hurricane. However, state regulators often impose rules that block insurers from charging premiums that reflect true risk. Anyhow, Trump’s efforts are likely to make the human toll and property damage from future disasters considerable worse. This is especially likely to be the case when he decides that he knows best what to do and prevents competent people from conducting sound disaster management and relief efforts. The disasters themselves will be a hit to the economy but are unlikely to be recession-causing stuff. We could see tens or even hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed, businesses put out of operation for weeks, or even months, and hundreds of thousands of workers possibly without jobs. However, relief efforts actually provide a short-term boost to the economy, unless Trump refuses to do them to punish blue areas. The bigger hit is likely to be the longer-term response to disasters. Insurers are not in business to lose money. When they see enough disasters in an area, they will simply pull out of selling policies as many have done in Florida and California. If they see the risk as growing and/or decide they can’t gage the risk adequately because Trump has shut down good data sources, they are likely to pull out of more areas. If people can’t get insurance on a home, they won’t be able to sell it, since banks all require insurance to issue a mortgage. We could see the housing market shut down in large parts of the country. This can be a very serious blow to the economy and financial markets. I won’t try to etch out details here, but let’s just say it is serious bad news. Splurge of Spending Cuts I won’t spend much time on this one, just because I consider it highly unlikely. The point here is simply that Elon Musk and his team seem to have no idea of how the economy works. When he initially set off with his DOGE team he was boasting about finding $2 trillion to cut from the annual budget, as in not over ten years. This would be a bit less than one-third of the budget and close to 7.0 percent of GDP. If Musk actually did cut spending by 7.0 percent of GDP it would lead to a Great Recession type recession. Fortunately, this seems off the table for now, as Musk has learned a little bit about where government money actually goes. The Trump-Republican team still seem intent on big cuts, but these look to be roughly an order of magnitude smaller. And they are likely to come with tax cuts to rich people, whose spending will largely offset the economic (not the human) impact of cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Debt Limit Crisis This is one that would appear on almost everyone’s list. The story is that Democrats refuse to provide any votes to raise the debt ceiling, and the small number of Republicans who actually care about the debt block passage of the necessary legislation. This would mean that the government would be unable to borrow, and at least for a period of time unable to pay all its bills. This would clearly shake financial markets. Whether it leads to a full-fledged economic meltdown is more questionable and likely depends on how long the standoff lasts. This issue also involves even more speculation than usual since its not clear Trump feels bound by the rule of law, so his actions, even if not legal, could mitigate the impact. In any case, this is likely to lead to higher interest rates, as investors attach greater risk to holding U.S. debt. That is a needless cost to the economy, but we are most likely talking about tenths of a percentage point, not whole percentage points. Messing with Economic Data This is probably not on most people’s Trump crises lists but should be. The story here is that we have top quality statistical agencies, most notably the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), that provide us accurate data on a regular basis untainted by political interference. Both parts of this are hugely underappreciated. We often hear complaints about large revisions to the data (I’ve made them myself), but this is due to the complexity of trying to measure a $30 trillion economy with 340 million people. The data are never perfect, but these agencies do the best they can, based on their own research, and work done by academic economists and statisticians around the country and the world. This brings up the second and more important part, the people putting together the unemployment statistics, the Consumer Price Index, and other data that we depend on to know the state of the economy, are professionals who are committed to the integrity of the data. They do not lower the unemployment rate to make the president look better or make inflation go away by cooking the numbers. The MAGA crew, starting with Trump, often complained about the numbers being manipulated under Biden and Obama. This was utter nonsense. Unfortunately, it never got the push back from the media, or even the Democrats, that it should have. Comments from Trump or other prominent Republicans saying the data was manipulated should have been treated as being equivalent to declaring the Earth is flat, they are that crazy. Anyhow, as the MAGA crew will tell us, the President has the unquestioned authority to make the unemployment rate or inflation rate whatever he wants it to be. If Trump’s tariffs or his inept handling of the bird flu pandemic push the year- over-year inflation in March to 4.0 percent, he can just order BLS to report the inflation rate as 2.0 percent. The top people there will quit, or be fired, but Trump can force them to publish whatever inflation rate he wants. The same applies to our GDP numbers. If Trump’s policies of not paying out money owed and laying off tens of thousands of government workers and contractors, cause GDP to slump in the first quarter, he can just instruct BEA to report strong 3.5 percent growth. This may sell on Fox News and other right-wing media outfits, but it will be a disaster on financial markets and for the longer-term health of the economy. We should expect interest rates to soar and the stock market to plummet, since investors will decide that they no longer have any idea of the true state of the U.S. economy. Over the longer term, we will see both domestic companies scaling back investment plans and foreign companies looking elsewhere. The United States will have declared itself an untrustworthy nation, where rules mean nothing and can be changed for convenience. Hopefully, Trump, or the people around him, will have enough sense to keep him from undermining the statistical agencies, but at this point, we can not take that for granted. Recipes for Disaster Okay folks, those are my MAGA eight, come up with your own stories for how Trump can crash the economy. Also, I welcome people who know these issues better than I do expanding on or correcting what I wrote. Anyhow, looks like we might have some exciting times ahead of us.

Milestone For Wyoming Uranium Operation	Uranium Energy Corp's Irigaray Central Processing Plant has produced its first dried and drummed uranium concentrates since the resumption of in-situ recovery operations at the company's Christensen Ranch project. The Irigaray plant, in Wyoming, is the central hub to 11 satellite in-situ recovery (ISR) projects across the Powder River Basin. Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) took ownership of the plant and the orebodies through its 2021 acquisition of Uranium One Americas Inc from Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom. In January 2024 the company's board of directors approved the restart of the Christensen Ranch ISR operation, with recovered uranium to be processed at Irigaray, and in September the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality gave UEC the go-ahead to increase the plant's licensed production capacity from its current 2.5 million pounds U3O8 (96.2 tU) to 4.0 million pounds U3O8 per year. According to information from the US Energy Information Administration, Irigaray had last produced uranium in 2018. UEC President and CEO Amir Adnani said the milestone had been reached on schedule, six months into the phased ramp-up of its operations in Wyoming (operations at Christensen Ranch started in August last year). 'This marks the culmination of many years of planning and hard work from our entire team and is a testament to their expertise and dedication. UEC’s fully permitted ISR assets provide a cost-efficient foundation for sustainable growth, positioning UEC as a key player in the expanding nuclear energy sector,' he said. ISR - also known as in-situ leach, or ISL - recovers minerals by dissolving them from the orebody in the ground and pumping the resulting solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered at a processing plant. UEC has two ISR hub and spoke platforms in South Texas and Wyoming, where a central processing plant forms the 'hub' with several ISR uranium projects providing 'spokes'. The uranium concentrates produced at Irigaray will be transported to the ConverDyn Conversion Facility in Metropolis, Illinois, UEC said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wjybF3yDhowdq	2025-02-20T16:04:29-08:00	
Burning Questions Over Indonesia’s Cooking Transition – Analysis	By Data Avicenna and Intan Permata Sari Indonesia’s shift to cleaner cooking fuels has seen notable success, particularly through the 2007 ‘Zero Kero Program’ which reduced domestic kerosene use by 92 per cent in less than ten years by transitioning households’ cooking fuel to Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). While the program’s primary goal was reducing kerosene subsidy costs, it also resulted in positive health impactsthrough reduced indoor air pollution. But today, Indonesia faces a new set of challenges. With an annual LPG consumption of approximately eight million tons and a domestic production capacity of only 1.7 million tons, Indonesia’s reliance on LPG imports has driven the government’s LPG subsidy spending to as high as Rp 80 trillion (US$4.9 billion) per year. As President Prabowo Subianto’s administration looks toward achieving energy self-sufficiency, the current dependence on imported LPG and subsidies’ strain on government finances raise pressing questions about Indonesia’s path forward. Indonesia has taken some steps to address the financial burden of LPG subsidies. The Indonesian government aims to reduce imports of LPG to zero by 2030, partly by promoting electric cooking appliances, including induction stoves, in 700,000 households. Yet the adoption rate is currently low — only 0.76 per cent of Indonesian households in 2021 used induction stoves. The challenges of electric stove pilot projects in Denpasar and Semarang in 2022 came from low household electrical capacities which were unsuitable for high-wattage stoves. The push for induction stoves poses a trade-off — though it may reduce the financial burden of imported LPG, the country still depends heavily on fossil fuels for electricity. Unless there is a massive deployment of renewable energy, this shift could increase greenhouse gas emissions. For induction stoves to be an environmentally sustainable option, acceleration in the renewable energy transition is the first step. About 14 per cent of the country’s energy mix comes from renewable sources, much less than the 23 per cent target set for 2025. Expanding the renewable energy grid would also align with Prabowo’s broader goal of achieving energy independence. With an expanded renewable energy grid, the government could reallocate the LPG subsidies towards incentivising households that are ready to transition to induction stoves, addressing the financial burden of LPG subsidies while simultaneously promoting sustainable energy practices. Induction stoves can also be incentivised by implementing purchasing restrictions on subsidised LPG to ensure that it only reaches its intended beneficiaries — low-income households. These restrictions, combined with targeted incentives, could accelerate the adoption of induction stoves. In 2024, the government imposed limitations so that only registered, eligible people could purchase the subsidised 3-kilogram LPG tanks. While the implementation initially appeared inadequate due to subsidised LPG still being accessible to all consumers, the subsidy is largely reaching its intended beneficiaries — most subsidised LPG consumers come from the poorest 70 per cent of households. Higher demand for induction stoves could also promote domestic production by encouraging new manufacturers to enter the market and enabling existing producers to reduce per unit production costs through larger-scale production. Indonesia’s domestic production of induction stoves remains limited with only two manufacturers available and an annual production capacity of 317,000 units in 2022. To address the low electrical capacities of many Indonesian households, a possible initiative is to promote domestic production of lower-wattage models of induction stoves that are less costly and more compatible with household capacities. But there are costs and barriers associated with low-wattage stoves, including research and development costs and cultural barriers. Since low-wattage could mean slower cooking, Chinese-Indonesian dishes that rely on high-heat wok cooking might not be suitable, while the opposite applies for slow-cooking dishes like the West Sumatran ‘rendang’. Providing incentives in the form of lower costs to upgrade households’ electrical capacities can also be implemented. But some lower- to middle-income households might be more reluctant to adopt induction stoves due to higher electricity costs unless they receive continuous incentives such as electricity discounts. Ensuring that households upgrading their electrical capacities also adopt induction stoves — possibly through enforcement mechanisms — should also be factored into policy decisions to maximise the effectiveness of such incentives. The economic feasibility of switching to induction stoves also depends largely on the payback period — how long it takes households to recover their initial investment through energy cost savings. This investment includes not just the stove itself, but also new cookware compatible with electric cooking. Understanding these costs is crucial for policy design. Indonesia’s transition to induction stoves requires more than policy reforms and infrastructure improvements. It demands a fundamental transformation of the country’s energy mix. With renewable energy making up only 14 per cent of the current mix, sustainable adoption appears unlikely in the near future. Success hinges on a coordinated approach — expanding the renewable energy grid first, then gradually implementing household transitions and addressing infrastructure gaps while protecting vulnerable households. Only then can Indonesia achieve energy independence without compromising environmental objectives or household welfare.

South Korea And US Hold First Joint Aerial Exercise Of 2nd Trump ...	By Mok Yong Jae South Korea and the United States on Thursday conducted the first joint aerial drills of the current Trump administration, completing a 'simulated precision strike,' according the U.S. Air Force. The South Korean Ministry of Defense said that South Korean F-35 and F-15 fighter jets joined U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers and F-16 fighters, all of which took off from locations within South Korea. Four U.S. Marine F-35s launched from Japan also joined the exercise, the Air Force said in a report published on its website. 'This training was conducted to demonstrate the extended deterrence capabilities of the United States against North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats and to strengthen the interoperability of the South Korea-U.S. combined forces,' a South Korean Defense Ministry official told Radio Free Asia. He said that together the two countries would cooperate to deter and respond to North Korean threats. The B-1B was also part of trilateral joint exercises with the U.S.-South Korea and Japan in December. 'Advanced training like today’s event ensures we’re able to maintain the high levels of readiness necessary for our combined defense posture,' Lt. Gen. David Iverson, the U.S. Seventh Air Force commander said in the Air Force report. 'Each time our aircrew plan, execute and debrief together, we build proficiency in our tactics, techniques and procedures to defend the Alliance, if required,' he said. South Korea and the United States have expanded military cooperation over the past few years in response to North Korean threats. Joint drills with South Korea and three way drills with Japan have recently included more advanced technology including submarines, long-range bombers, and aircraft carriers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj9HLR7dNQCii	2025-02-20T16:00:33-08:00	
Russia: St. Petersburg To Use CCTV Cameras On Streets To Identify...	In order to fight crime and prevent the emergence of ethnic enclaves, St. Peterburg plans to upgrade its CCTV cameras on its streets so that the authorities can identify passersby by ethnicity, Oleg Kapitanov, head of the nationalities committee in the city’s government, has announced. This kind of ethnic profiling is notoriously inaccurate, but other Russian cities are likely to follow St. Petersburg’s lead, yet another example of Russia’s moves toward totalitarian control of its people ( Moves toward such totalitarian methods of control are taking place at enormous speed in Putin’s Russia now. At the same time that the use of CCTV cameras to determine ethnicity was announced, the Russian government announced new requirements for doctors to share information about their patients. As of March 1, all Russian doctors will be required to share information with the police on patients with mental disorders who are deemed 'a threat to others' (publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202407220010?index=1). Activists say this order may soon be expanded to include data on other parts of patients’ lives (theins.ru/history/278606). In the last decades of Soviet power, for example, the state required doctors to share information about drug use, homosexuality, and other characteristics that the regime deemed improper. What Moscow is now demanding opens the door to the restoration of such requirements and a further restriction of doctor-patient confidentiality. That is likely to mean both that doctors will turn in the information the state wants and the state will take action against those so identified and that those in high risk groups will now avoid going to doctors and getting the treatment they need lest the doctors providing the treatment send information about them to state institutions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wjwg9aBW5zSbZ	2025-02-20T15:58:51-08:00	
Uzbekistan: Torturers’ Impunity ‘Is Mockery Not Justice’ – Analys...	By Mushfig Bayram Officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 repeatedly tortured Muslim prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov during 2023 and 2024, including threatening him with death. On one occasion, prison officer Davr Sottiyev severely beat Astanov and told him that before he leaves, 'he [Sottiyev] will give Astanov an injection which will soon kill him', a local Muslim who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. As a result of Sottiyev's severe physical torture, prisoner of conscience Astanov was placed in the prison medical unit. Prisoner of conscience Astanov, who is now 53, made multiple complaints about the torture he experienced to the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Ombudsperson. Against the regime's legally-binding human rights obligations, officials have taken no action against prison officer Sottiyev or other suspect torturers. The regime's only response was to send an alleged forensic medical 'expert' to examine Astanov and then claimed there were 'no traces of wounds or bruises'. The Muslim commented: 'This is mockery not justice' (see below). In January 2025, Prison Governor Farrukh Ismatov, head of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1, called relatives of prisoner of conscience Astanov. He claimed to them that Astanov is fine and that they have no need to complain to the authorities about his situation. The relatives understood that they were being threatened with punishment if they lodge complaints (see below). Various officials of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the regime-appointed Human Rights Commissioner or Ombudsperson's Office have refused to answer Forum 18's questions about the multiple cases of torture inflicted on prisoner of conscience Astanov (see below). The regime tries to stop its Muslim prisoners from praying the namaz, and frequently tortures those who do meet other Muslims for prayer. If prison authorities detect groups of Muslims praying together, they will put them in punishment cells for several days, Muslims who Forum 18 has talked to from October 2024 onwards have stated. Prison authorities may not detect or punish individual prisoners praying the namaz alone (see below). Officials are preparing to add a further prison term to that of 30-year-old prisoner of conscience Fariduddin Abduvokhidov. A Tashkent court jailed him in November 2020 along with six other prisoners of conscience for between 11 and four years. Their 'crime' was to meet in Tashkent to discuss Islam. On 5 December 2023, a court in Tashkent Region added 10 years to his existing 11 year prison term. His 'crime' was to be three minutes late for a prison roll call. In November 2024, Navoi Regional Police Criminal Investigation Department opened a new criminal case against him (see forthcoming F18News article). From summer 2024, the regime has apparently implemented a policy of putting Muslim prisoners of conscience in a punishment cell for several days each to prevent them being eligible for early conditional release, or to make it easier to transfer them to a harsher-regime prison. Prisoners of conscience Faryozbek Kobilov and Alimardon Sultonov are among those given such spells in a punishment cell. Officials then sent Sultonov to a harsher prison (see forthcoming F18News article). Repeated torture of prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov for praying In 2021, Tashkent City Criminal Court jailed prisoner of conscience Tulkun Tashmuradovich Astanov (born 25 April 1971) for five years for defending Muslims' freedom of religion and belief. In 2021, officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 repeatedly tortured him, in June for praying the namaz (Muslim daily prayer), and in October also. As a result his health seriously deteriorated. The regime tries to stop its Muslim prisoners from praying the namaz, and frequently tortures those who do meet other Muslims for prayer. If prison authorities detect groups of Muslims praying together, they will be put in punishment cells for several days, Muslims who Forum 18 has talked to from October 2024 onwards have stated. Prison authorities may not detect or punish individual prisoners praying the namaz alone. Against legally-binding international human rights obligations, no-one has ever been held to account for the torture of prisoners of conscience such as Astanov. In July 2021, Governor Farrukh Ismatov of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 refused to explain to Forum 18 why no-one has been arrested and put on criminal trial for torturing Astanov or other prisoners. As the United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT) noted in its Concluding Observations on Uzbekistan in January 2020 (CAT/C/UZB/CO/5): 'The Committee remains deeply concerned at reports that torture and ill-treatment continue to be routinely committed by, at the instigation of and with the consent of the State party's law enforcement, investigative and prison officials.' International human rights obligations Uzbekistan is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This defines torture as 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.' Under the Convention, Uzbekistan is obliged both to arrest any person suspected on good grounds of having committed, instigated or acquiesced to torture 'or take other legal measures to ensure his [sic] presence', and also to try them under criminal law which makes 'these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature'. Impunity for Astanov's suspect torturers 'is mockery not justice' Again during 2023 and 2024, officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 tortured prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov on multiple occasions, including threatening him with death. During autumn 2023, prison officer Davr Sottiyev on multiple occasions severely beat, suffocated, and threatened Astanov with death. 'He told Astanov that he will not let him leave the prison alive. Before Astanov leaves, he [Sottiyev] will give Astanov an injection which will soon kill him,' a local Muslim who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 in February 2025. As a result of Sottiyev's severe physical torture, prisoner of conscience Astanov was placed in the prison medical unit. The prison officer on duty (who refused to give his name) at Bukhara Region's General Regime Prison No. 1 refused to answer Forum 18's questions on 18 February about the torture of prisoner of conscience Astanov. He also refused to put Forum 18 through to Prison Governor Farrukh Ismatov. In 2024, prisoner of conscience Astanov made multiple complaints about the torture he suffered to the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Ombudsperson. Officials have taken no action against prison officer Sottiyev or other suspect torturers. The regime's only response was to send an alleged forensic medical 'expert' to the prison in spring 2024. The 'expert' wrote a report claiming that prisoner of conscience Astanov had 'no traces of wounds or bruises on his body'. The Muslim commented: 'This is mockery not justice.' Prison governor threatens relatives if they complain In January 2025, Governor Farrukh Ismatov of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 called various relatives of prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov. He claimed to them that Astanov is fine and that they have no need to complain to the authorities about his situation. The relatives understood that they were being threatened with punishment if they lodge complaints. Various officials of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, who refused to give their full names, between 10 and 12 February refused to answer Forum 18's questions about the multiple cases of torture inflicted on prisoner of conscience Astanov. Damir (who refused to give his last name), who leads the international affairs section of the Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, refused on 12 February to answer Forum 18's questions. He asked to be called back in three hours when 'I will have time to answer you'. He did not answer his phone whenever Forum 18 called back. Various General Prosecutor's Office officials, who refused to give their names, also refused to answer Forum 18's questions. Press Service official Asadullo Fatkhullayev claimed he would answer Forum 18's questions in writing by the end of the working day on 12 February. Forum 18 had received no answer by the end of the working day of 19 February. Aziz Yuldashev in the regime-appointed Human Rights Commissioner or Ombudsperson's Office, who deals with complaints, claimed to Forum 18 on 12 February that he had not heard of prisoner of conscience Astanov. Yuldashev went on to claim that he would 'check in our system if indeed there were complaints' and by the end of the working day reply to Forum 18's questions. Yuldashev then contradicted himself by also claiming that he would provide the contact details of responsible officials in the Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments to which the Ombudsperson's Office had (allegedly) made enquiries about prisoner of conscience Astanov. Despite Yuldashev's promise to reply by the end of 12 February, Forum 18 had received no answer by the end of the working day of 19 February. Prisoner of conscience Astanov is being held in General Regime Prison No. 1 in Bukhara Region, over 440 kilometres (275 miles) from his home in Tashkent.

Trump Says He Has Not Seen Egyptian Counter To His Plan For Gaza	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening he has not seen the proposal being discussed by Arab leaders as an alternative to his plan to take over Gaza once the war between Hamas and Israel ends. 'I haven’t seen it,' Trump said in response to a reporter’s question on Air Force One. 'Once I see it, I’ll let you know,' he added. Trump said early this month he wants to forcibly relocate almost 2 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt. He said the United States will 'own' the territory and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' which prompted rejection by Arab countries. It’s unclear whether Trump is serious or merely threatening to extract concessions from Arab states. During a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that it could be the latter, urging regional leaders to make a counteroffer. The Saudi crown prince will host leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and other Gulf Cooperation Council states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates Friday in Riyadh to discuss options, including an Egyptian plan to raise up to $20 billion over three years from Arab and Gulf states for Gaza’s reconstruction. Under this plan, Gazans would not be forced out and the strip would be governed by Palestinians. Saudi connection Trump spoke en route to Washington after delivering remarks at a conference in Miami, hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund – the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the crown prince. His speech marked the first time a U.S. president addressed the annual gathering of global financiers and tech executives. It is a testament to how the Saudi crown prince, known by his initials MBS, has leveraged his connection to Trump, Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said. The prince established close ties during Trump’s first term and continued business ties with the Trump organization while the president was out of office, including investing $2 billion to a firm belonging to Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, Jared Kushner. 'Trump believes in the Golden Rule, but not the Golden Rule from Sunday school,' Blumenfeld told VOA. 'It's if you're rich, you're right.' As Riyadh leads the charge to unify Arab nations to support postwar Gaza, there may be signs that Trump is softening his demand. In his wide-ranging remarks that lasted over an hour, Trump did not mention Gaza beyond repeating what he said was his role on the ceasefire signed January 19, during the last day then-President Joe Biden was in office. 'We've secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we're bringing in the hostages, and we're bringing them home to their families,' Trump said, adding that some of the hostages 'are in pretty bad shape.' He lauded Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi wealth fund, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Jadaan. The White House did not immediately respond to VOA’s query on whether Trump met with any of the Saudi delegation during the event. During his Wednesday remarks Trump thanked the Saudi crown prince for hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials Tuesday to find a way to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies have decried the meeting as an effort to sideline Kyiv. Egyptian proposal on Gaza Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said under the proposal, 'secure areas' equipped with mobile houses and shelters will be established as living areas in Gaza while Egyptian and international construction firms rebuild the devastated infrastructure. The proposal also calls for forming a national Palestinian committee of technocrats and community leaders unaffiliated with Hamas to govern postwar Gaza. It is unclear whether the plan has the support of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that currently rules parts of the West Bank and administered Gaza until it lost the 2006 election to Hamas. 'What is needed now is a political solution to Gaza to make that reconstruction both physically possible and long term sustainable,' said Tariq Kenney-Shawa, U.S. Policy Fellow at the Palestinian Policy Network Al-Shabaka. The goal is that 'we don't return to a situation where Gaza remains under occupation,' he told VOA. On Monday Hamas indicated a willingness to cede any postwar governance role. 'It is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political and administrative arrangements in the next phase for Gaza, especially if it serves the interests of our people,' Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told Al Arabiya TV. Hamas made the conciliatory statement as negotiations toward phase two of the ceasefire is set to begin in days, after weeks of delay. However, it fulfills only part of Israel’s and the United States’ key demand — the elimination of governance and military role for Hamas in postwar Gaza. So far Hamas has not shown it would disarm. Meanwhile Israel has not defined what it considers an acceptable alternative governing entity to Hamas and has rejected any involvement of the Palestinian Authority. The Egyptian proposal also does not solve a longstanding issue between the warring parties. Israeli leaders oppose any postwar plans that would pave the way to a two-state solution, while a sovereign Palestine remains a key requirement for Palestinians and Arab countries. Expedited hostage release A top Hamas official announced earlier this week that the group will return the remains of four deceased Israeli hostages and free six living ones in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 47 senior Hamas members. Israel will also allow mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under phase one of the ceasefire that called for the gradual release of 33 hostages, eight of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas took about 250 hostages and killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel. Analysts said the expedited exchange of hostages and prisoners could mean that both parties are anxious to secure what they can now, due to concerns the truce will collapse before phase one expires next week. 'What we're looking at now is possibly — possibly a swifter resolution to phase two,' said Mirette Mabrouk, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'But if that happens, then that sort of signals near the end of the conflict,' she told VOA. 'And that's something that [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he's not going to want without Hamas being disarmed.' Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. It insists it will only release them in exchange for a permanent end to fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Israel's counteroffensive to the Hamas attack has displaced more than 2 million Palestinians and killed more than 48,200, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants.

Guantánamo Needs To Be Shut Down, Not Expanded – OpEd	In a deeply disturbing and unprecedented move, the U.S. has begun transferring immigrant detainees to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. They’re being held without access to their lawyers and families. President Trump has ordered up to 30,000 'high-priority' migrants to be imprisoned there as part of his larger mass deportation and detention campaign. Trump claims these migrants are the 'worst criminal aliens threatening the American people.' But recent investigations of those detainees have already challenged this narrative. And a large percentage of immigrants arrested in the U.S. have no criminal record. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time our government has invoked 'national security' to deny marginalized communities their basic human rights. President George W. Bush created the infamous military prison at Guantánamo during the 'War on Terror' to hold what his administration called the 'worst of the worst.' The prison has since become synonymous with indefinite detention — 15 people still remain there today, over 20 years later. Notorious for its brutality and lawlessness, Guantánamo should be shut down, not expanded. Of the 780 Muslim men and boys imprisoned there since January 2002, the vast majority have been held without charge or trial. Most were abducted and sold to the U.S. for bounty and 'had no relationship whatsoever with the events that took place on 9/11,' reported the UN’s independent expert in 2023, who reiterated the global call to close Guantánamo. The Bush administration designed the prison to circumvent the Constitution and the 1949 Geneva Conventions, refusing to treat the prisoners as either POWs or civilians. This legal fiction resulted in a range of human rights violations, including torture. But the Constitution — and international law — still applies wherever the U.S. government operates. All prisoners, including immigrants, are still entitled to humane treatment, legal counsel, and due process. 'Never before have people been taken from U.S. soil and sent to Guantánamo, and then denied access to lawyers and the outside world,' said Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney in the ACLU case challenging Trump’s executive order. However, the U.S. does have a sordid history of detaining migrants captured elsewhere at the base. As legal scholar Jeffrey S. Kahn points out, the U.S. has detained Haitians at Guantánamo on and off since the 1970s. In the 1990s, thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing persecution following a military coup were captured at sea. The U.S. held them in horrific conditions at Guantánamo so they couldn’t reach U.S. shores to seek asylum — which is a fundamental human right long enshrined under U.S. law. Shrouded in secrecy, the U.S. continues to capture and detain asylum seekers fleeing Haiti, Cuba, and other Caribbean countries at Guantánamo. Last fall, the International Refugee Assistance Project reported that refugee families are kept in a dilapidated building with mold and sewage problems, suffer from a lack of medical care, and are 'detained indefinitely in prison-like conditions without access to the outside world.' Trump’s order would take these abuses to a horrifying new level. Currently, the base’s existing immigration detention facility can hold up 120 people. Expanding it to 30,000 will require enormous resources. The 'War on Terror' prison at Guantánamo already costs an estimated $540 million annually, making it one of the most expensive prisons in the world. Then there are the moral costs. The mass deportation and detention of asylum seekers is not only unlawful but cruel — and not a real immigration solution. Instead, our government should prioritize meaningful immigration reform that recognizes the dignity of all people. We should also shut down the 'War on Terror' prison at Guantánamo once and for all — and pursue accountability for its decades of abuses. Otherwise, it will only continue to expand. 'I can attest to the facility’s capacity for cruelty,' warned Mansoor Adayfi, who was subjected to torture and endured nearly 15 years at the prison. Guantánamo’s legacy of injustice must end.

UN Calls For Rapid Economic Recovery In Syria To Reverse Losses F...	By Ephrem Kossaify A newly published report from the UN Development Programme warned that at current growth rates, the Syrian economy will not recover to prewar levels until 2080, leaving the country stuck in a state of prolonged hardship and instability. It also underscored the urgent need for a rapid economic recovery to help reverse the decades of progress that were lost as a result of the 14-year civil war. The conflict shattered nearly four decades of economic, social and human development, causing irreparable damage to the nation’s infrastructure, economy and social fabric. The report, titled 'The Impact of the Conflict in Syria: A Devastated Economy, Pervasive Poverty, and a Challenging Road Ahead to Social and Economic Recovery,' offers a detailed analysis of the socioeconomic state of the country, and outlines a road map for rebuilding its economy and infrastructure. According to the UNDP’s preliminary socioeconomic impact assessment, gross domestic product in Syria has halved since the war began in 2011, representing a loss of $800 billion over the past 14 years. Poverty has reached alarming levels, with the national poverty rate soaring from 33 percent before the war to 90 percent. Extreme poverty has also skyrocketed, with 66 percent of the population now affected, up from just 11 percent prior to the conflict. Three out of four people in the country rely on humanitarian aid and are in urgent need of support for critical aspects of life such as healthcare, education, employment, food security and housing. The country also has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, with one in four Syrians jobless. Achim Steiner, the administrator of UNDP, said that the requirements for Syria’s recovery extend beyond the immediate need for humanitarian aid. 'Restoring productivity for jobs and poverty relief, revitalizing agriculture for food security, and rebuilding infrastructure for essential services such as healthcare, education and energy are key to a self-sustaining future, prosperity and peace,' he said. The damage to Syria’s infrastructure, which has left many essential services nonfunctional, is among the primary obstacles to recovery. The report highlights a staggering array of damage: nearly 50 percent of schools are closed, one-in-three housing units have been destroyed, and nearly half of the nation’s water-treatment plants and sewage systems are no longer operational. Energy production has plummeted by 80 percent, with power plants and transmission lines heavily damaged. These failures in basic services exacerbate poverty levels and block any meaningful path toward recovery. The UNDP report also highlighted the devastating loss of life during the war, and the decline in health infrastructure. Nearly 618,000 Syrians died during the conflict, and 113,000 were forcibly disappeared, their whereabouts still unknown. Meanwhile, the collapse of the healthcare system has exacerbated the crisis; a third of all medical facilities have been damaged and almost half of ambulance services are no longer operational. The education sector was also hit hard, leaving 40-50 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 15 unable to attend school. The widespread destruction of housing has left 5.7 million people in need of shelter support. Essential infrastructure, including water-treatment plants, sewer systems and power plants, has been severely damaged, leaving millions without access to clean water, sanitation or reliable energy supplies. Syria’s position on the Human Development Index has plummeted to its lowest point since 1990, further illustrating the catastrophic effects of the war on the nation’s development. The economic outlook remains grim but hope can be found in the potential for robust growth if the correct strategies are implemented, the UNDP said. Its report calls for an ambitious approach to development, as growth rates will need to increase sixfold if they are to recover within a decade. At the current rate of annual growth, 1.3 percent, it would take more than 50 years to restore GDP to prewar levels. To recover within 15 years, Syria would need to achieve a growth rate of 5 percent, and a tenfold increase in growth would be required for the country to reach the level of development it could have attained in the absence of the war. Abdallah Al-Dardari, UNDP’s assistant administrator and director of its regional bureau for Arab states, stressed the important need for comprehensive reforms, and said: 'Syria’s future hinges on a robust development-recovery approach. 'This demands a comprehensive strategy addressing governance reform, economic stabilization, sector revitalization, infrastructure rebuilding, and strengthened social services.' He told Arab News that this strategy for recovery will rely on investments and on good management of those investments, as he underscored the institutional requirements Syria will need to meet to attract private investment in infrastructure. 'If you want to invest $100million or $200 million in (a) highway, you need to first of all be sure that you can go to the court, and the court will treat you equally if you have a litigation with your counterpart, which is the government,' Al-Dardari said. 'You need to make sure that there are internationally recognized arbitration systems. You need to make sure that your money can come in and leave the country. You need to make sure that your banking system respects the highest standards of banking. 'I can give you a very long list of things that need to be done and are not there yet. So this is an arduous journey. This is not an easy journey.' Al-Dardari also told Arab News about the effects of international sanctions, imposed on the Assad regime during the war, on the economy and the ways in which they are hampering recovery progress. 'I'll give you an example,' he said. 'Who is going to bring those investments of $36 billion while they are not really sure that the banking sector is free to bring in money, to use the SWIFT (banking system) to transfer funds and to invest? 'How do you make sure that your shipments into Syria of raw materials or semi-manufactured products are protected? How do you make sure that your exports from Syria can arrive at their destinations, and money will be paid for those exports? 'So at every step of the way in recovery, sanctions will play a role. The chilling effect of sanctions, what we call the ‘overload lines,’ will accompany those sanctions. So our core message (to countries) here is: Please understand the impact of sanctions and act accordingly.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj9p67zXoM_VI	2025-02-20T15:46:32-08:00	
Seven Weaknesses In ‘Fortress Switzerland’ – Analysis	The Swiss armed forces are grappling with significant challenges in a shifting geopolitical landscape. Experts highlight seven pressing problems that must be addressed by the next Swiss defence minister. By Balz Rigendinger The Swiss army is not up to the challenges of the present. Russia’s war against Ukraine has brought uncertainty to Europe and the need for enhanced defence capabilities. Swiss politicians from across the political spectrum recognise that need and parliament has already agreed to raise defence spending to 1% of GDP by 2032. But combat readiness has been a perennial problem for the Swiss army. There are seven other pressing issues demanding the attention of whoever succeeds Viola Amherd as defence minister. 1. Lack of strategy Historically, the Swiss army has adapted its resources to align with prevailing threats, hammering out new strategies in the process. These strategic frameworks were essential for communicating the rationale behind substantial expenditures to both the public and the troops. The last serious attempt at reform was initiated in 2010. Since then, the geopolitical situation has changed drastically – yet an adequate strategic vision to deal with it remains lacking. True, it is no longer necessary to ask 'what’s the point of the army?' after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the Swiss defence sector has lost any coherence it ever had as it scrambles to respond to a myriad of fresh challenges. Hybrid warfare, rapid advancements in digital technology, and the return of tank warfare – all need to be considered. 'We are being presented with numerous wish lists. But to set priorities right, we need an overall strategy,' says Priska Seiler Graf of the Social Democratic Party. She chairs the defence policy committee of the House of Representatives. Senator Werner Salzmann of the Swiss People’s Party adds: 'The current top priority is the defence capability of Switzerland in all areas. But we are not yet seeing any comprehensive defence concept from the government.' 2. Air defences are weak Most experts on the armed forces would agree that air defence is becoming more and more important. Yet Switzerland is weak in the air, because the two things needed – fighter jets and air defence systems – are outdated and require a major overhaul. In fact, they seem to be stuck in a never-ending overhaul phase. The 25-year-old F/A-18 fighter jets the Swiss air force uses are in a preventive maintenance programme to keep them going. Due to complications, this programme has had to be extended. Monitoring of Swiss air space is also a weak point. A system adequate to deal with serious incursions is only being developed now. The development process is troubled at best. Air defences for the middle-distance range are completely out of date. It is not known when a new system will become available. 'We are expecting it by the end of the decade,' says Kaj-Gunnar Sievert, spokesperson for the Federal Office of Defence Procurement. The replacement fighter jet, the F-35, has been ordered from US defence contractor Lockheed Martin. The first eight of the 36 planes bought are due for delivery in 2028. The tense security situation worldwide may lead to delays, however. The F-35 is already considered to be costly in terms of maintenance. 'We may be in for a few nasty surprises,' says parliamentarian Seiler Graf. 3. Procurement getting out of control In quick succession, Switzerland’s main financial oversight bodies both sounded the alarm about armed forces procurement. These are the finance delegation of parliament, which is responsible for the detailed examination and supervision of the national budget, and the Federal Audit Office. In December, parliament’s finance delegation warned that projects to a total value of CHF19 billion ($21 billion) were being affected by 'delays, increasing risks and insufficient resources'. Then in mid-January, the Federal Audit Office sharply criticised a CHF300 million procurement order for reconnaissance drones. The Hermes 900 drone, which is already established on the market, has been undergoing an elaborate customisation process to meet the special requirements of Switzerland. This Israeli drone needs to be able to fly around the Alps, necessitating the installation of a diesel engine and de-icing system – two long-standing problems. In addition, Switzerland wants to have an automatic evasion system built into the drone to prevent collisions with paragliders in the Alps. The result has been a debacle, with the first five delivered drones currently grounded and requiring helicopter escorts when they do return to service. The procurement of these drones has been significantly delayed. 4. Military IT projects in limbo The Swiss government is currently working on 22 digitalisation projects, all of which are strategically important, worth millions, and highly complex. Nine of these 22 projects are being run by the defence ministry. Hardly anything is going according to plan. 'We have identified seven projects that are causing us concern,' says army chief of staff Thomas Süssli. The jewel in the crown of these digital efforts is the development of a proprietary operating system to run military computers, essentially a 'Windows for the army'. It has been in the works for a decade. The list of requirements for this system is ambitious. There has to be a single platform for managing warfare across all operational terrains: on the ground, in the air, in cyberspace, in the electromagnetic (radio communications) and information space. All weapon systems should be compatible with it. And all data should reside in Switzerland, stored on secure servers, and independent of the normal power grid. There are further key projects in defence which the finance delegation of parliament finds to be at risk of failure. Has Switzerland bitten off more than it can chew? 'It remains a challenge to bring all these projects to a successful conclusion,' admits General Süssli. 5. Disagreements about international cooperation Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland came under pressure about its attitude to NATO. US ambassador Scott Miller said in 2023: 'In a way, NATO is a doughnut, and Switzerland is the hole in the middle.' What he meant was this. Switzerland benefits from the protection of the NATO states surrounding it. It doesn’t give anything back – it’s not even able to defend itself adequately. Defence minister Viola Amherd, during her time in office, took rapid steps to bring about cooperation with the Western alliance and with Europe. One decision that has been taken is to join the European air defence system called Sky Shield. Yet all such steps are controversial on the home front, for the People’s Party in particular sees Swiss neutrality as being endangered. 'Neutrality is what has protected us. That too is a part of the overall design of Swiss defence,' insists senator Salzmann. Going it alone militarily brings the risk of being left to stand alone in the event of war. 'One can only wonder how it can be in NATO’s interests to provide defence for a rich country which takes the liberty of making minimal efforts of self-defence and itself refuses to provide support in times of crisis.' This is what well-known strategy expert Mauro Mantovani said recently in an opinion piece in the newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung. The pressure from NATO and the EU for greater Swiss involvement is not likely to lessen. A new defence minister will therefore need to make Switzerland’s case abroad – and explain the position taken by other countries to the voters at home. This latter effort will have to be done as part of a referendum campaign. The Neutrality initiative of the People’s Party, due to be voted on soon, is intended to put a stop to any cooperation with NATO. 6. Lack of qualified people to fill jobs The lack of qualified people, a general problem in industry, also affects the Swiss defence sector. The Federal Intelligence Service alone reports it needs 150 more staff. Army planners are even more concerned about the overall demographic trends in the country. 'According to the army’s own projections, in the 2030s we will not be able to muster 100,000 recruits to serve,' says one. The existing obligatory national service system is about to undergo reform. There is a people’s initiative in the offing to require everyone with Swiss citizenship to carry out some service for the community, the 'Service citoyen initiative'. This initiative is also an attack on the traditional conscription framework, since opportunities to serve are to be more varied and a matter for freer choice. 'Staffing levels for the army are guaranteed with this initiative,' insists campaigner Noémie Roten. At the same time, two other new systems of national service are being developed. Both of these are likely to be subject to a nationwide vote as well. In Autumn 2024 a federal government studyExternal link found that a good half of those serving in the army stated that they had experienced discrimination or sexual abuse there. The leadership of the army committed to remedy this. The military knows that it will soon have to show clearly and convincingly what Swiss citizens are giving years out of their lives for. 7. A risky legacy of problems Then there are a number of legacy issues. One is the dumping of ammunition in mountain regions and lakes, which went on for decades without much thought being given to the consequences. The most notorious example is the little village of Mitholz in the Bernese Alps, which is unwilling host to 3,500 tonnes of old munitions buried in a vault in the mountainside. It will take until 2040 to clean up this dangerous mess. So far there have been a few surprises in this dossier as more information on the caches came to light. So it might take longer still. Another issue is the Swiss arms manufacturer RUAG. The company attracted some unwelcome attention in recent years due to a corruption scandal and cross-border lawsuits. The federal government has wanted to privatise this state-owned entity for quite a while. But there were a series of hitches. What is more, European customers began to lose interest when Switzerland forbade them to pass on Swiss armaments they had bought to the Ukrainians. The federal government has changed its mind on the future of the company. Now it is thinking of incorporating RUAG completely into the defence ministry. Yet, time and again, the company has been plagued by compliance problems. Switzerland is taking a big risk here.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdX9-WdxIa1_WC	2025-02-19T16:55:20-08:00	
LAC Stalemate: Why China Fears Fighting In The Himalayas – Analys...	The towering peaks of the Himalayas form more than just a geographical barrier between India and China; they represent a formidable military challenge. The Line of Actual Control (LAC), where the two nations’ troops stand eye to eye, presents some of the harshest conditions known to warfare. For China, these mountains are more than a border—they are a battleground for which it remains unprepared. The Terrain That Tests Resolve The LAC’s rugged terrain and extreme altitude impose logistical nightmares. Sustained military operations here require highly skilled soldiers and a robust support infrastructure. At elevations where oxygen levels drop by 40 percent at 15,000 feet, combat effectiveness declines sharply. These conditions are an unfamiliar adversary for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), whose training largely focuses on plains and urban warfare. In contrast, the Indian Army’s history is steeped in high-altitude warfare. Decades of deployment in Siachen—the world’s highest battlefield—and the gruelling Kargil conflict at 16,000 to 18,000 feet altitudes have honed Indian soldiers into specialists in mountain combat. The Kargil War, fought on steep, rocky terrain under extreme weather, remains a testament to India’s unmatched resilience and skill in these unforgiving environments. Infrastructure: India’s Operational Edge A modern war is fought not just with weapons but with roads, bridges, and airstrips. India’s focused efforts to enhance border infrastructure have paid dividends. Strategic projects, from advanced airstrips to all-weather roads, have cut troop deployment times drastically. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has operational bases in Leh, Chandigarh, Bagdogra, Tezpur, and Hasimara—much closer to the LAC than China’s facilities. With Rafale fighter jets and S-400 missile systems now in its arsenal, India’s rapid-response capabilities are unmatched. Meanwhile, though expanding, China’s infrastructure in Tibet continues to lag. The absence of highways, railways, and airfields capable of sustaining large-scale military operations limits Beijing’s options. Heavy artillery and tanks—essential for prolonged ground operations—are of limited use in such inhospitable terrains, further diminishing China’s ability to mount an offensive. Acclimatised and Armed: India’s Military Readiness India’s advantage is not solely infrastructural. The Indian Army’s long-standing mountain divisions undergo rigorous acclimatisation and training, making them battle-ready at short notice. Strategic positions along key heights in eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh give India control over vital observation and mobility routes. Sophisticated surveillance systems—including drones, satellites, and advanced radar—ensure that Chinese troop movements are detected long before they pose a threat. Recent studies by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and the Center for a New American Security reaffirm India’s operational superiority in high-altitude warfare. These assessments underline that while China may possess numerical superiority, India’s defensive positioning neutralises this advantage. The Two-Front Predicament for China Beijing’s strategic calculus is further complicated by its focus on Taiwan. Taiwan represents not just a territorial claim but a core national interest for China—a geopolitical chess piece that could draw in global powers like the United States and Japan. Engaging in a prolonged Himalayan conflict risks diluting China’s military focus, leaving its flanks vulnerable in the Taiwan Strait. A two-front scenario would overstretch China’s resources and logistics. Balancing the demands of two geographically and strategically distinct conflicts is a challenge the PLA would struggle to manage. India’s steady military presence along the LAC ensures that any miscalculation by China could lead to an engagement it cannot sustain. Quad and Diplomatic Calculations India has cultivated robust strategic partnerships, unlike China, which finds itself increasingly isolated in the Indo-Pacific. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)—comprising India, the United States, Japan, and Australia—has emerged as a significant deterrent to Chinese aggression. Regular joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and enhanced defence cooperation with Western allies position India as a linchpin in regional security. India’s influential role in the Indo-Pacific further limits China’s strategic manoeuvrability. A conflict with India risks galvanising this emerging coalition, opening up new diplomatic and military resistance fronts for Beijing. Economic and Diplomatic Repercussions The economic stakes are equally high. India-China bilateral trade surpassed $136 billion in 2023, underscoring deep economic interdependence. However, India has shown a willingness to leverage this relationship when national security is at stake. The ban on over 300 Chinese apps following the Galwan Valley clash inflicted significant losses on Chinese tech giants. A full-scale conflict would trigger further economic decoupling, with India restricting investments and operations of major Chinese companies. The diplomatic fallout would be equally severe, casting China as an expansionist power at a time when its global image is already under strain due to tensions in the South China Sea and human rights issues in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Resilience and Strategy: India’s Calculated Posture The LAC has been described by top military officials and experts as stable but sensitive. India’s sustained deployment along the border and proactive military-to-military dialogues ensure that tensions are managed and do not escalate inadvertently. India’s diplomatic finesse in maintaining global partnerships has further reduced its strategic vulnerabilities. By presenting itself as a responsible power committed to regional stability, India has not only strengthened its own position but also exposed the limitations of China’s strategic posture in the Himalayas. A Stalemate on India’s Terms China’s reluctance to escalate tensions along the LAC is rooted in a complex web of strategic, logistical, and economic considerations. The extreme terrain of the Himalayas, India’s superior high-altitude warfare capabilities, infrastructural advantages, and robust diplomatic networks make a full-scale conflict an unpalatable option for Beijing. By transforming the LAC stalemate into a scenario that exposes Chinese weaknesses rather than one that serves Beijing’s territorial ambitions, India has demonstrated that in the heights of the Himalayas, it holds the upper hand—on its own terms and in its own time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdXxNo3LZveCh6	2025-02-19T16:53:53-08:00	
Family Politics: The Marcos-Duterte Feud And The Future Of The Ph...	By Pradeep Nadig The Philippine government is currently being led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the unpopular former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., and Vice President Sara Duterte, daughter of the controversial former President Rodrigo Duterte. They joined hands and were brought into power in 2022 but their fragile alliance is now in shambles and going through a very public breakup. The situation reached boiling point in November 2024, when Duterte made death threats against Marcos, the First Lady, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, adding that arrangements had been made to kill them in the event of her assassination. The outcome of this fracas is likely to have stark domestic implications. It will also affect the country’s foreign policy, including its relationship with India, in 2025. Election predictions The collapse of this alliance comes ahead of the 2025 midterm elections in which all 317 seats in the House and 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate will be contested. Both dynasties are fighting to create a favourable situation for themselves in preparation for the 2028 presidential elections. Marcos has proposed extending presidential term limits beyond the current six years, but to do so, he must retain control of the House. In November 2023, he released former Senator Leila De Lima, who was Rodrigo Duterte’s fiercest political opponent. She was widely believed to have been imprisoned due to her vocal criticism of his administration and his brutal war on drugs. Her release well ahead of the midterm elections in 2025, where her vocal opposition to the Dutertes could help Marcos consolidate power in the House, is strategic. Meanwhile, the Duterte family is working to gain electoral ground in the House and set up favourable odds for Sara Duterte’s presidential campaign in 2028. The family has nominated Senate candidates that are not part of the ruling coalition party and many independent candidates who are known Duterte allies. Rodrigo Duterte is also preparing to run for mayor of Davao City, a position he held prior to becoming president in 2016. Following Sara Duterte’s statements and death threats and the corruption charges against her, the House has filed for her impeachment. This investigation led Rodrigo Duterte to describe Congress as a 'rotten institution.' The Dutertes are aiming to shift the balance of power to avoid Sara Duterte’s impeachment while Marcos needs to ensure that impeachment happens so that he can extend the presidential term limit and prevent Duterte from becoming president in 2028. Foreign policy differences As president, Marcos has deviated significantly from Rodrigo Duterte on foreign policy. While Duterte was known for his pro-Beijing position, Marcos’ actions in the past year indicate a clear pro-Washington stance. Unlike the former president, who continued to appease Chinese territorial claims and military exercises in the West Philippine Sea (even after winning an arbitration case in 2016), the current president has gone on a diplomatic and even security offensive. Duterte assumed an anti-US position despite Chinese maritime aggression. In 2021, however, he finally reversed his decision to end the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) that allowed US access to military bases in the Philippines. Although the agreement was reinstated, trust between Washington and Manila remained low until Marcos’ victory in 2022. In April 2023 Marcos granted the US access to four additional Philippine military bases in an expansion of the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) that was signed in 2014. Marcos has claimed that this measure was taken primarily to boost disaster relief in the area in addition to defending its coastline on the South China Sea. Bilateral ties between the US and the Philippines have made great strides in Marcos’ tenure. The countries have jointly issued new bilateral defence guidelines that updated the 1951 Mutual Defence Agreement between the two. These new guidelines have resulted in greater defence cooperation, foreign military funding, expansion of military bases, and an increase in military equipment supplies. In 2024, when the Spratly Islands dispute boiled to open confrontations between China and the Philippines, Marcos doubled down on Manila’s claims, strengthening its ties with Washington. Implications for India Marcos’ position on China, unlike that of Duterte, has been better for New Delhi. Since 2022, trade relations between India and the Philippines have steadily improved with the total value crossing US$ 3 billion. The two countries have also made great strides in defence cooperation, resulting in the sale of the BrahMos missile system to the Philippines worth US$ 375 million. During the fifth India–Philippines Joint Defence Cooperation Committee meeting held in Manila on 10 September 2024, India’s Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane encouraged the defence partnership between the nations and advocated for the joint development of military equipment. Marcos’ foreign policy has bolstered defence against China’s expansion in the South China Sea, which aligns with both the US and India’s strategic agenda for the region, making way for greater bilateral and trilateral security cooperation. Outreach to the Philippines also provides India with an opportunity to showcase its reliability and power to others in the ASEAN region. This was the theme of the 20th India-ASEAN summit held in Jakarta in 2023, which aimed to boost maritime cooperation. Increased defence cooperation with the Philippines signifies the end of India’s reluctance to supply weapons to ASEAN in fear of China’s response. As New Delhi seeks to become a leader in defence exports and position itself as a strategic partner, its ties with Manila must continue to grow for the success of its future foreign policy in Southeast Asia. The current political climate combined with shared strategic interests and the positive relationship between Trump and Modi have created favourable conditions for stronger India-Philippines ties in 2025. Future dynamics While these opportunities exist, Donald Trump’s election as president raises certain questions. The Marcos administration has received support from the US in deterring China thus far, however, the newly elected Trump administration could decrease military spending abroad and adopt an anti-interventionist stance, which would leave the Philippines in a vulnerable position. The upcoming midterm elections are likely to rebalance power between the Marcos and Duterte families. With potentially greater influence in the House and Senate, the Dutertes could advocate for a return to more pro-China policies and make it difficult for the US to continue joint military operations and access military bases in the Philippines. This would also undermine New Delhi’s influence in the region and hinder growing military cooperation with Manila. The Dutertes would also be better positioned to oppose Marcos’s proposal to extend the presidential term limit, making Sara Duterte a favourite for the 2028 presidential elections. If this were to happen, it would greatly hurt both New Delhi and Washington’s foreign policy interests in the region for the better part of a decade.

Choppy Waters Continue In The South China Sea – Analysis	By Carlyle Thayer China escalated its aggression in the South China Sea in 2024, highlighting the ongoing struggle between maritime rights, sovereignty and security. Several confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have led Manila to engage in security efforts to curb China’s intimidation, while divisions within ASEAN continue to hamper efforts to establish a South China Sea Code of Conduct. In 2024, China stepped up its intimidation, harassment and coercion against the Philippine Navy, Coast Guard and civilian vessels and aircraft operating legally within the country’s exclusive economic zone. China deployed large numbers of People’s Liberation Army Navy, China Coast Guard (CCG) and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) vessels into the West Philippine Sea. China also passed Provisions on Administrative Enforcement Procedures for Coast Guard Agencies in June 2024 and issued coordinates for baselines around Scarborough Shoal in November to provide ostensible legal cover for its coercion against the Philippines. But Chief of the Armed Force of the Philippines General Romeo Brawner characterised China’s grey zone tactics as illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive. From February to June, CCG and PAFMM vessels repeatedly confronted Philippine rotation and reprovisioning (RORE) missions to the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese coercion included dangerous manoeuvring, deliberate ramming and the use of high-powered water cannons. On 17 June, Chinese vessels conducted their most violent confrontation of a Philippine RORE mission. Armed Chinese sailors attacked a Philippine rigid hull inflatable boat and assaulted Filipino marines, smashed communication equipment, confiscated weapons and punctured the hull. The 17 June incident marked an inflection point. After a series of discussions, the two sides announced a provisional agreement to prevent similar incidents on 21 July. Philippine RORE missions were conducted without incident for the remainder of the year. But the agreement did not include Sabina and Scarborough Shoals. In April, after the discovery of crushed coral at Sabina Shoal, the Philippines deployed Coast Guard vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua to pre-empt Chinese construction, leading to a series of confrontations with Chinese vessels. On 19 August, 40 Chinese vessels blocked resupply and rammed the hull of the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times. On 12 September, as the BRP Teresa Magbanua withdrew due to ration, medical and ship repair needs, China surged 207 vessels to Sabina Shoal. Confrontations also escalated at Scarborough Shoal. In August, CCG military aircraft fired flares in Philippine air force flight paths. In December, China dispatched air and naval ‘combat readiness patrols’ around Scarborough Shoal, including a 12,000 ton CCG ship. In response to escalating Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, the Philippines announced a whole-of-government Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept in January 2024. The concept promotes greater interoperability between the tri-services and civilian agencies to conduct combined maritime and air defence operations. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also approved the US$35 billion Re-Horizon 3 program to modernise the Philippines’ Armed Forces. In November, Marcos Jr signed into law the Philippines Maritime Zone Act and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act to bolster its sovereign jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea. The Philippines also participated in bilateral and multilateral land, sea and air military exercises with the United States, Australia, Japan and other security partners. While the United States offered to assist in resupply at Second Thomas Shoal, the Philippines declined, stating that they ‘will exhaust all means before seeking foreign intervention’. But the Philippines permitted the deployment of the US Typhon Strategic Mid-Range Fires System in April during Exercise Salaknib. China protested vehemently and declared that relations with the Philippines were at a crossroad. In November, it was revealed that a US military task force had been deployed to Palawan island to assist the Philippines in logistics and maritime domain awareness. Unlike the Philippines, 2024 was relatively quiet on Vietnam’s eastern front. In June, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reported growing Vietnamese construction on the Spratly Islands through landfill, dredging harbours and constructing infrastructure, including a 1050 metre airfield on Barque Canada. But China has remained silent on Vietnam’s activities in the South China Sea. Within ASEAN, progress towards a South China Sea Code of Conduct has remained stalled. At the annual ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on 25 July, it was reported that Cambodia and Laos, the 2024 ASEAN Chair, blocked a proposal by the Philippines to include a reference to the 17 June incident. By the year’s end, various ASEAN diplomats privately reported that little progress had been made on the third reading of the South China Sea Code of Conduct because of divisions within ASEAN. Looking ahead to 2025, China will continue to assert its sovereignty over land features and adjacent waters within the West Philippine Sea and try to take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration. The Philippines will redouble its self-defence measures and seek reassurance from the United States that its alliance commitment is ironclad. Vietnam will continue to improve infrastructure on its land features. On the South China Sea Code of Conduct, China will continue to play a double game in negotiations with ASEAN by pressing for an early conclusion of negotiations as a diplomatic ploy while letting negotiations drag on, as both options prevent direct US involvement.

The New India-US Security Compact – Analysis	By Vivek Mishra As states transition in economic heft, power, and influence, so do their relationships. Most starkly, this is visible in the changing nature of their ties with great powers. On the contrary, the recalibrations by great powers themselves have implicit success stories about growing powers, not just one of accommodation but increasingly, compulsion. While the United States (US) has remained a constant paradigm of growth, influence, and both soft and hard power for over three-quarters of the last century, China and India have presented two very contrasting pictures of the kind of relationship rising states have with the preeminent power of the world. China’s growth in the last three decades, in many ways, was facilitated by the US’s role as the global security guarantor. Now, China and the US are fundamentally locked in a great power competition, with almost every aspect of the contest speeding towards a downward spiral. Three factors have intensified this trend. First, rapid shifts in American social and political choices and patterns domestically have altered how America thinks of its security and role in the world. Second, the US wants to retain its numero uno position even as China is hurtling from behind in the most critical of domains that underscore this great power competition. China’s transformation of its naval power brings unprecedented pressure onto the Indo-Pacific countries and in the tacit spread of its economic tentacles throughout the world, compelling a reassessment of the metrics of the global power dynamic. Finally, a new tech race, which is beginning to unravel and will likely shape the course of great power competition in the next few decades, has enforced an order of multilateral accommodation of rising powers upon the US. Together, these have led to a new utilitarian view of security, power and influence in Washington. India is at the helm in that reassessment of Washington. When the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited the US to meet with his counterpart, President Donald Trump, on 13-14 February 2025, camaraderie, nostalgia, optics, and pragmatism seemed to roll into one. Keen observers of the India-US relationship were expecting Trump to give a new imprint to the bilateral relationship and not simply conform to the existing paradigms of continuity in bilateral ties. The barely 40-hour trip saw a new US-India COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) agreement, which aims to serve as the new broad framework for combining cooperation in defence, trade, energy security, technology and innovation, people-to-people ties, and multilateral cooperation. For the last two decades, the India-US defence ties based itself on the continued momentum provided by the 2005 Framework for the US-India Defence Relationship which promised 'setting the US and India on a path to increasingly broad, complex, and strategic cooperation' and the subsequent 10-year framework signed in June 2015 which provided 'avenues for high-level strategic discussions, continued exchanges between armed forces of both countries, and strengthening of defence capabilities.' The latest extension of the framework is reflective of the expansive nature of defence ties between the US and India, especially in its increasing importance for cooperation in the transfer of sensitive technologies and strategic trust. India and the US announced the signing of a new ten-year framework this year for the US-India Major Defence Partnership in the 21st Century, as the one signed in 2015 nears its culmination. Importantly, the new framework weaves in India’s Major Defence Partner (MDP) status to ensure that new technology access and supply guarantees in the area of defence and security can be part of a sustained process over the next decade. A path that was set for the India-US defence cooperation in 2005 has required a new thrust every 10 years to accommodate new priorities. The latest iteration has placed the expansion of defence industrial cooperation, coproduction, and interoperability at the heart of bilateral defence ties. Among key plans to speed up supplies for India’s defence requirements, India and the US have announced that they will pursue new procurements and co-production arrangements for ‘Javelin’ Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and ‘Stryker’ Infantry Combat Vehicles in India this year. Besides, the procurement of six additional P-8I Maritime Patrol aircraft is likely to boost India’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the expanse of the Indo-Pacific region. The second Trump administration has clearly taken a long view of the security ties with India, wherein the focus of the planned steps is to further integrate bilateral security ties by making them deeply structural. A wider leveraging of India’s MDP status through the Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 (STA‑1) authorisation; initiating negotiations for a Reciprocal Defence Procurement (RDP) agreement to enhance bilateral procurement channels and establish well-oiled reciprocal supply lines for defence goods and services; and reviewing arms transfer regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), are all geared towards fostering deeper integration, interoperability, and co-production. Given the lessons learnt over the past five years—both on and off the battlefield—it was rather incumbent upon Modi and Trump to outline a roadmap for the next decade. The importance of autonomous systems to the future of warfare and security is one such domain. India and the US announced the Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA), a new initiative seeking to augment industry partnerships and production in the Indo-Pacific region. Partnerships between Indian and US companies for coproducing maritime systems and AI-enabled counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) could be useful for both countering and establishing deterrence. Perhaps most importantly, India and the US have broken ‘new ground’ by announcing their intention to 'support and sustain the overseas deployments of the US and Indian militaries in the Indo-Pacific'—a significant joint security commitment to the region. These deployments could reshape how India and the US approach regional security in the Indo-Pacific by enhancing cooperation in logistics, intelligence sharing, force mobility for joint humanitarian and disaster relief operations, and, most importantly, for countering common threats from the Gulf to the Far East. There were several other announcements in the field of technology, innovation, energy security, space and people-to-people ties, which all feed into the new security compact between the two countries. However, three trends in the India-US bilateral as well as their multilateral cooperation framework stood out in the joint statement. The Indian Ocean will be a key domain in the Indo-US cooperation. The launch of the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture—a bilateral initiative to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce—along with Meta’s ambitious 50,000-kilometre undersea cable project, underscores a long-term commitment to connect and strengthen global digital infrastructure and regional security. Second, Modi’s visit underscored that the commitment of both India and the US to the importance of the Quad framework in the Indo-Pacific remains resolute. And finally, a key convergence point in this new bilateral compact between India and the US is connectivity projects. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to serve as the next transregional connectivity project which could reroute energy supply chains. However, its success remains contingent on the geopolitical externalities of the Middle East. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President J.D. Vance emphasised that America expects Europe to take on a greater security role, allowing Washington to focus on other critical regions. The implicit message was clear: Indo-Pacific security and the challenge posed by China remain top priorities for the US. Despite concerns that a second Trump administration might scale back America's global security commitments, its strategic competition with China is set to continue. A confident Trump administration views India as a crucial partner in advancing its strategic objectives while recalibrating America’s role on the global stage.

Indonesia: With Next Election Years Away, Prabowo Already Eyes Se...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus Four months into his presidency, Indonesian leader Prabowo Subianto has already secured his party’s nomination for re-election, but analysts say the move is premature because of his untested leadership amid pressing economic challenges. While the announcement at the Gerindra party’s 17th anniversary celebration last week signaled confidence in Prabowo’s leadership, experts say it might also be a strategic move to consolidate power and pre-empt potential rivals, including his vice president. 'If his policies work, the people will see him as an effective leader and naturally re-elect him,' Ali Sahab, a political analyst at Airlangga University, told BenarNews. 'But right now, poverty and unemployment are our most pressing challenges. Addressing them requires deep, strategic policies to foster sustainable economic growth.' Indonesia’s poverty rate stood at 9% as of 2024, while unemployment is at 5%, according to government statistics. The coalition that helped Prabowo be elected last year, known as the Advanced Indonesia Coalition Plus, could also shift its allegiances before the next election, Ali said. 'In politics, there are no permanent alliances, only permanent interests,' he said. 'If Prabowo is perceived as underperforming, support could shift elsewhere. On Saturday, Gerindra Secretary-General, Ahmad Muzani announced that a special party congress had reached a unanimous decision to nominate Prabowo again. 'The entire Gerindra Party cadre has requested that we nominate Prabowo Subianto as the presidential candidate for the 2029 general election,' Muzani said. In addition to securing the party’s nomination, Prabowo was reappointed as Gerindra’s chairman and chief patron. Prabowo struck a cautious tone in his speech to the party on Saturday. 'If my programs fail, there is no need to nominate me again,' he said. However, in a move seen as an effort to consolidate his political influence, Prabowo on Friday proposed a 'permanent coalition' among his allies. The Presidential Communications Office declined to comment on the nomination, referring all inquiries to Gerindra. While major coalition parties such as Golkar, the National Awakening Party, the National Mandate Party, and the Democratic Party have voiced support for Prabowo, the National Democratic Party (NasDem) remains undecided. 'It’s too early to discuss this,' the news portal Tempo.co. quoted NasDem executive Willy Aditya as saying. Dominique Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Gerindra’s confidence in nominating Prabowo again was fueled by strong approval ratings for the new president’s performance in his first 100 days in office. A January survey by Litbang Kompas found that public satisfaction with the Prabowo administration stood at 80.9% – significantly higher than the roughly 60% approval rating former President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo had received early in his first term. Dominique attributed the high approval to Prabowo’s flagship program: free school lunches for students, a populist initiative that has resonated with many Indonesians. 'The free lunch program is a top-of-mind issue for Indonesians,' Dominique said. 'Populist programs tend to generate high approval ratings.' The early nomination also raises questions about Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka’s political future. Gibran, 37, Jokowi’s eldest son, is widely speculated to be a potential presidential contender in the next general election, in 2029. Ali, of Airlangga University, said Prabowo’s decision to accept the nomination might stem from concerns over Gibran’s ambitions. 'This could be Prabowo’s way of pre-empting a challenge from within his own ranks,' he said. Ambang Priyonggo, a political analyst at Multimedia Nusantara University, said that Prabowo’s early bid could also be a political strategy to project stability and commitment. 'This is likely an attempt to quash speculation that Gibran could take over the presidency before 2029,' Ambang told BenarNews. ‘Prabowo is logical choice for Gerindra’ Despite high approval ratings, the new administration has faced criticism for economic management and budgetary inefficiencies. A recent survey by the Center for Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS) that polled 95 experts and journalists gave Prabowo’s government an average performance score of 5 out of 10. Prabowo’s economic policies, including the free school lunch program, have also come under scrutiny. 'The program is proving inefficient in terms of budget allocation and coverage,' Ambang said. 'Reallocating funds to support it has had unintended consequences, creating dissatisfaction among other sectors of the economy,' he said, referring to the president’s controversial austerity measures. Arga Pribadi Imawan, a political analyst at Gadjah Mada University, said Prabowo’s early nomination reflects a broader trend in global politics: the centralization of power around individual candidates rather than political parties. 'In contemporary politics, it is the figurehead who matters, not the party,' Arga told BenarNews. 'Prabowo remains a dominant political figure in Indonesia, while his rivals from the 2024 election have seen their influence wane. This makes Prabowo the logical choice for Gerindra.' Trubus Rahadiansyah, a public policy expert at Trisakti University, said that Prabowo’s nomination also serves as a loyalty test for his ministers. 'This is a way for Prabowo to gauge who among his cabinet members is truly loyal to him,' Trubus told BenarNews. He pointed to recent policies introduced by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia, such as restrictions on the sale of subsidized liquefied petroleum gas that were later revoked after sparking public outrage. 'That policy benefited businesses more than ordinary citizens,' Trubus said, adding that such controversies could undermine Prabowo’s administration if not addressed properly.

Xi Jinping’s Bureaucracy In 2025: A Critique In The New Political...	Chinese Premiere Xi Jinping remains firmly in control of China's political landscape, with no visible plan for succession, barring extreme events like a lost war or economic collapse. Most opposition has fled the country, as fear prevents any serious challenge to his rule. Xi's firm control over the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is unprecedented in modern China, especially after abolishing presidential term limits in 2018. His lack of a clear successor suggests an intent to rule indefinitely, which may ensure stability in the short term but creates uncertainty for the future. Historically, authoritarian regimes without succession plans often face power struggles when the leader eventually leaves. The absence of a designated heir could lead to internal conflicts within the CCP when Xi is no longer in power. The only possible threat to his authority could emerge from within the security apparatus if internal disagreements become public. Furthermore, his grip on power is not static; it is continuously reinforced through persistent anti-corruption efforts and Party rectification campaigns. In other words, Xi Jinping's entrenched control over China's political system and the mechanisms he employs to maintain power is prominent since he started up until now (2025). Political Variables: Controlled and Not The lack of a clear successor suggests that Xi intends to rule indefinitely, breaking with the leadership norms established after Mao Zedong's era. This raises concerns about political stability in the long term, as the absence of a transition plan increases the risk of a power struggle when he eventually leaves office. Also, it means a weakness of political opposition that emphasizes that opposition within China has largely disappeared, with dissenters either forced into exile or silenced through political repression. This suggests a highly controlled political environment where resistance is ineffective. While this strengthens Xi's immediate grip on power, it does not necessarily eliminate discontent rather, it forces opposition underground. If economic hardships or political scandals arise, suppressed grievances could resurface, potentially destabilizing the regime. Meaning, it that discontent is potentially creating instability in the future. Meanwhile, there are potential internal challenges within his political fence. Although Xi appears unchallenged, the mention of the security apparatus as a possible source of opposition is significant. Security forces[1] are crucial to maintaining authoritarian rule, and if internal divisions emerge, they could pose a serious threat to his leadership. Thus, if divisions emerge within China's security forces whether due to policy disagreements, economic struggles, or leadership disputes Xi's position could be at risk. While there is no clear indication of this happening, it suggests that control over the military and intelligence agencies remains a key factor in his rule. To wit, in authoritarian regimes, the military and intelligence agencies are often the key enforcers of the leader's rule, but they can also become sources of internal opposition. However, so far, he has maintained tight control over the military and state security agencies through purges and loyalty tests. There is also a role of anti-corruption and party rectification campaigns in Xi's bureaucracy and leadership. Rather than merely consolidating power in a passive way, Xi actively reinforces his authority through continuous anti-corruption drives and ideological campaigns. These serve two purposes: eliminating political rivals and maintaining loyalty within the Communist Party. While these measures strengthen his rule, such campaigns may also create resentment among officials who fear they could become targets, potentially fostering hidden opposition. If discontent grows within the party, it could lead to hidden opposition or even factional struggles. Aging Political Leadership The top leadership has been tilted in Xi Jinping's favor. But, as previously noted, this top leadership is also aging. An aging leadership also means that many of Xi's key supporters may retire or pass away, potentially opening room for new political dynamics that he may not fully control. In 2027, the current Politburo will have an average age above sixty-eight (68). Should they be renominated then, the average age of Politburo members would be above seventy-three on the eve of the next Party Congress and Current Central Committee members are not far behind. Their time horizon will become shorter, and as long as no potential successor appears to have been groomed, their political position will become increasingly vulnerable. Again, a defining feature of Xi's leadership is the lack of a designated successor, breaking from previous CCP norms that aimed to ensure stability through planned transitions. Without a clear heir, uncertainty will grow among the party elite, increasing the risk of political maneuvering or factional struggles as different groups seek to position themselves for leadership roles. This uncertainty could weaken Xi's grip on power over time, especially as leaders begin to consider their own political futures beyond his rule. As the current leadership ages and their career time horizons shrink, their incentives may shift. Rather than unwavering loyalty to Xi, some officials might begin looking for alternative paths to secure their personal or factional interests. If no successor emerges, competition among different factions could intensify, creating a fragile political environment. Additionally, older officials may become less effective in governance, potentially exacerbating policy stagnation or mismanagement, further weakening the regime's overall stability. Unless Xi Jinping changes his basic formula to ensure support and discourage any line debate, his power will become brittle, and the likelihood of a succession crisis will increase. His leadership strategy is either by grooming a successor or adjusting his approach to elite management. While his current control appears strong, the absence of institutionalized succession mechanisms makes a future power struggle more likely. Historically, power vacuums in authoritarian regimes often lead to internal conflicts, and China could face a similar scenario if Xi does not prepare a clear transition plan. There are also nuanced views of Xi Jinping's governance style, highlighting both his consolidation of power and the underlying complexities within China's political and economic landscape. Despite Xi's centralization of power and strong grip on influence, Chinese bureaucracies remain highly fragmented, with institutional silos, rival factions, and competition among individuals. This contradicts the idea of a fully unified authoritarian system, suggesting that power struggles still play a role in policy decisions. From here, tt depicts a complex picture of Xi Jinping's governance, emphasizing the tensions between his centralization of power and the persistent institutional, factional, and economic dynamics within China. Clearly, there is Xi's ability to enforce policy shifts while maintaining ideological rigidity, as well as the role of elite competition in shaping China's future. Additionally, the influence of princelings (descendants of revolutionary leaders) remains significant, particularly in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and financial institutions. While the next leader may not necessarily be a princeling, elite clans could act as key power brokers, determining leadership transitions behind the scenes. At a deeper extent, there is a pattern in Xi's governance since his helm started; initial inflexibility followed by strategic reversals or rigidity then with certain pragmatic adjustments. When policies face resistance or cause unintended consequences, this would be addressed through a 'pullback pattern' or 'rear-view mirror approach' that are evident in key crises, including: The COVID-19 lockdowns, which persisted rigidly until a sudden reversal in late 2022. The 2015 stock market crisis, where interventionist policies failed to stabilize financial markets. The 2020 real estate crash, in which Xi initially rejected bailouts but later allowed targeted financial support. The U.S.-China trade war, where initial confrontational policies eventually gave way to selective economic adjustments; even up to the first quarter of 2025. This suggests that Xi is a risk-taker but not reckless. Meaning, he is willing to implement bold policies but is also pragmatic enough to change course when necessary. However, these reversals are often framed in a way that protects his authority, shifting blame onto subordinates or external factors. Xi's political capital plays in a 'selective policy flexibility versus ideological rigidity'. While Xi has shown pragmatism in adjusting economic policies, his core ideological agenda remains unchanged. His governance remains centered around: Reinforcing ideology, particularly through slogans and propaganda that elevate his personal authority. Promoting 'struggle' (斗争), which can mean striving for progress but also preparing for external conflicts or internal challenges. Maintaining a strong international posture, with an ever-present possibility of major geopolitical confrontations. Even in areas where Xi has shown flexibility such as real estate bailouts or fiscal stimulus, these shifts are constrained by his broader ideological commitments. This balancing act ensures that economic policies remain adaptable without undermining his centralized control. At the backdrop of this, Xi Jinping has been deepening policies that pre-existed his rule. A look at history indeed reveals an affinity with the Self-Strengthening Movement of the Qing empire, summed up by the famous maxim: 'Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning for practical use' (中学为体, 西学为用). Republican China sought help from Germany to modernize its arms industry and sent students on scholarships to the United States. The best-known case is that of the rocket scientist Qian Xuesen who, after leaving the United States in 1955, led China's ballistic development, and whose influence stretches to this day. After the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty was the basis for what has been called the largest technology transfer in history. Much of this focused-on industry and infrastructure, but it also involved education and the training of scientists, including in the nuclear field. The Sino-Soviet rift inaugurated a period of closure, but Mao Zedong nonetheless launched several 'big projects' during the Great Leap Forward. They are recalled nowadays to justify the present large-scale policies. At the end of the Cultural Revolution, 'Zhou Enlai, followed by Deng Xiaoping', hailed the 'four modernizations' (四个现代化) that put the accent on big science again. Since the early 1960s, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has never ceased from engaging in research and development on new weapons, serving as a harbor for scientists in times of political turmoil or during more recent anti-corruption campaigns. A chief aim of China's normalization with the United States was to acquire key technologies. From former US Presidents Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter's presidency, which was the heyday of the US convergence with China against the Soviet Union, supercomputers (supposedly for climate predictions), nuclear knowledge, radar installations, and many other dual use technologies were shared. Large contingents of Chinese students underwent education and training abroad, mainly in the United States. Successively, we can observe that Xi's foreign policy adaptations are evident with strategic pauses. There is a pattern of assertiveness followed by recalibration. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), once a cornerstone of China's global strategy, has seen a decline in outward investments and loans, possibly due to economic slowdowns and concerns over debt sustainability. Additionally, in response to changing global dynamics, particularly under a potential Trump second presidency (2024–2028), China appears to be cautiously reassessing its relationships with key nations, including India, Japan, and the UK. This suggests that while Xi projects strength internationally, he is also willing to adjust diplomatic strategies to navigate shifting geopolitical realities. Implication and Conclusion Per its implication, while Xi's control appears secure for now, the long-term consequences of his rule remain uncertain. The suppression of opposition, lack of a succession plan, and reliance on internal purges could make the political system more fragile over time. If economic challenges or elite divisions intensify, his grip on power may face unexpected tests. Xi's leadership is characterized by strong, centralized control, but his dominance is not necessarily permanent. His reliance on security forces, ideological campaigns, and repression keeps him in power, yet these same factors could generate internal tensions. Whether his rule remains stable or faces future challenges depends on how well he navigates potential economic, political, and internal security risks. While Xi Jinping maintains firm control over the CCP, the aging leadership and the absence of a succession plan introduce long-term vulnerabilities. If these issues remain unaddressed, they could lead to political uncertainty, elite fragmentation, and a potential succession crisis. Xi's ability to navigate these challenges will determine the long-term stability of his rule and the CCP's future. Xi Jinping's leadership is characterized by a mix of ideological rigidity and strategic pragmatism. While he has consolidated power, elite competition, bureaucratic infighting, and security apparatus tensions remain underlying factors in China's political landscape. His policy approach follows a recognizable pattern: firm initial positions, followed by controlled reversals, when necessary, which helps him maintain authority while adapting to challenges. However, as China faces economic pressures, elite struggles, and an evolving international environment, the long-term sustainability of this governance model remains uncertain. *Ideas and/or views expressed here are entirely independent and not in any form represent author's organization and affiliation.

Sacrificing Truth On Leviathan’s Altar – OpEd	Last Sunday, 60 Minutes featured tyrannical German prosecutors boasting about persecuting private citizens who made comments that officialdom disapproved. Three prosecutors explained how the government was entitled to launch pre-dawn raids and lock up individuals who criticized politicians, complained about immigrant crime waves, or otherwise crossed the latest revised boundary lines of acceptable thoughts. In a craven slant that would have cheered any mid-twentieth century European dictator, 60 Minutes glorified the crackdown: 'Germany is trying to bring some civility to the world wide web by policing it in a way most Americans could never imagine in an effort to protect discourse.' Nothing 'protects discourse' like a jackboot kick aside the head of someone who insulted a German politician on Facebook, right? Mocking German leaders is punished like heresy was punished 500 years ago—though no one has been publicly torched yet. Do the priggish German prosecutors realize that they are the latest incarnation of nineteenth-century German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel? Hegel declared: 'Men are as foolish as to forget, in their enthusiasm for liberty of conscience and political freedom, the truth which lies in power.' Hegel bluntly equated government and truth: 'For Truth is the Unity of the universal and subjective Will; and the Universal is to be found in the State, in its laws, its universal and rational arrangements.' Hegel probably did more to propel modern totalitarianism than perhaps any other philosopher. Unfortunately, many Americans favor the US government becoming a Ministry of Truth like the German government. Fifty-five percent of American adults support government suppression of 'false information,' according to a 2023 poll. But other polls show that only 20 percent trust the government to do the right thing most of the time. So why would people trust dishonest officials to forcibly eradicate 'false information'? Did some people skip logic class, or what? A September 2023 poll revealed that almost half of Democrats believed that free speech should be legal 'only under certain circumstances'—perhaps only when a rascally Republican is president? Hegelian notions of 'Government = Truth' propelled censorship here in recent years. Three years ago, Americans learned they lived under a Disinformation Governance Board with a ditzy Disinformation Czar who boasted of graduating from Bryn Mawr University. A public backlash led to the board’s termination but federal censors quickly and secretly resumed their sway over the internet. Though American censors rarely invoke Hegel, their schemes tacitly presume that political power is divine, if not in origin, at least in its effect. The Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), created in 2018, has relied on 'censorship by surrogate,' subcontracting the destruction of freedom. CISA partnered with federal grantees to form the Election Integrity Partnership a hundred days before the 2020 presidential election. That project, along with the efforts of other federal agencies, created an 'unrelenting pressure' with 'the intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech postings by American citizens,' according to a 2023 ruling by Federal Judge Terry Doughty. What standard did CISA use to determine whether Americans should be muzzled? CISA settled controversies by contacting government employees and 'apparently always assumed the government official was a reliable source,' Judge Doughty noted. Any assertion by officialdom could suffice to justify suppression of comments or posts by private citizens. But when did government I.D. badges become the Oracle of Delphi? During the 2020 presidential election campaign, CISA established a 'Rumor Control' webpage to deal with threats to the election—including rumors that the feds were censoring Americans. CISA targeted for suppression assertions by Americans such as 'mail-in voting is insecure'—despite the long history of absentee ballot fraud. Biden won the presidency in part thanks to Democrats exploiting the covid pandemic to open the floodgates to unverified mail-in ballots. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) declared, 'Twitter was basically an FBI subsidiary before Elon Musk took it over.' Censors act as if truth and lies are both self-evident. But as an investigative journalist hounding federal agencies, I have seen how government minimizes disclosures of its outrageous conduct. On April 19, 1993, 80 people died in a massive fire during an FBI tank assault on the home of the Branch Davidians. On that day, the FBI was adamant that they had nothing to do with the fire and also claimed to possess audiotapes proving the Davidians intentionally committed mass suicide. They never disclosed that proof. But anyone who suggested that the FBI was connected to the fatal fire was derided as an anti-government nut case, if not a public menace. A Los Angeles Times book reviewer practically blamed my criticism of the feds on Waco and other cases for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. But year by year, the FBI’s Waco storyline fell apart. Six years after the fire, a private investigator found proof that the FBI fired pyrotechnic grenades at the Davidians’ home before the fire, obliterating the FBI cover-up. The same pattern of delayed disclosures or leaks annihilated the US government’s credibility on the epidemic of Gulf War syndrome cases in the 1990s, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the glorious triumph for democracy and women’s rights after the US invaded Afghanistan. The 'trickle down' version of truth was also stark in the notorious Duke Lacrosse case. With his persistent, savvy analysis and investigations, Mises editor Bill Anderson heroically helped vanquish a media and prosecutorial lynch mob. Unfortunately, in Germany, and at least sporadically in the United States, 'truth' is whatever the government proclaims. 'Disinformation' is whatever contradicts the latest government pronouncements. It is irrelevant how many false statements politicians or bureaucrats make. Government retains a monopoly on truth and on the right to deceive. Recent censorship schemes vivify how democracy is being turned into a parody: voters choose politicians who then dictate what citizens are permitted to think and say. Censors destroy freedom of thought as well as freedom of speech. Censorship seeks to force each person to live in mental isolation, with no sparks for their thoughts from fellow citizens. Shortly before Hegel’s rise to prominence, German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, 'The external power that deprives man of the freedom to communicate his thoughts publicly, deprives him at the same time of his freedom to think.' By barricading individuals from each other, censors create millions of intellectual Robinson Crusoes, stranded on islands and trying to figure out everything for themselves. Prohibiting citizens from sharing facts of government abuses spawns a bastardized form of sovereign immunity. It minimizes opposition to political power grabs—often until it is too late to resist. Other European nations are as bad or worse than Germany. Britain is notorious for raiding the homes and arresting anyone who makes allegations about immigrants and crime. According to Irish Senator Pauline O’Reilly, government must 'restrict freedoms for the common good' when 'a person’s views on other people’s identities' makes them 'insecure.' Can I demand that government censor anyone who makes me insecure about my identity by mocking my vintage railroad engineer cap? By vastly expanding the definition of 'hate speech,' politicians justify suppressing any views they disapprove. Faith in officialdom to decree truth and punish error exemplifies growing political illiteracy. In earlier eras, Americans were renowned for heartily disdaining politicians who rose to power by making endless bogus promises. Why would any prudent person expect bureaucrats to deliver 'the truth, and nothing but the truth' like FEMA officials coming to the rescue after a flood? If the government can’t be trusted for reliable mail delivery, why in Hades would anyone trust government to judge and safeguard any thoughts citizens choose to share? Do people honestly expect that turning politicians into censors will evoke their inner sainthood? How can freedom of speech or any other freedom survive if so many people fall for so much BS from Washington?

How Hobbies Can Save Us From Over-Specialization – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen As we roll through the middle of February, we’re getting to the point of the year where most people start to abandon their New Year’s resolutions. According to research by Dr. Michelle Rozen, 94% of people fail their resolutions within two months. However, this doesn’t mean resolutions are a bad thing. New Year’s resolutions make good economic sense. People want to improve, but monitoring whether you’ve actually improved in something is costly. As such, using the beginning (and end) of a year as a benchmark provides a low-cost way of ensuring self-monitoring. Maybe many fail, but New Year’s provides a good place to start either way. For many, New Year’s resolutions involve reading more or losing weight. However, I’m noticing an increasing number of people centering their resolutions around hobbies. New Year’s resolutions and hobbies often go hand in hand. Among my friend group, people are pursuing resolutions of improving woodworking skills, learning how to work with glass, and honing jiu-jitsu skills. Recent Pew Research data suggests that, of the people who make resolutions, 55% make resolutions about hobbies. I see hobby-culture as an important part of our increasingly specialized society. While specialization has obvious upsides, we can also find clear downsides to the tendency. Hobbies act as a perfect hedge against the downsides of specialization. The Benefits of Specialization and Why It Matters Specialization as an idea comes at the very beginning of economics as a science. In Adam Smith’s book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, he introduces the idea of a factory that manufactures pins. He argues that if each person learns to make a small part (1/10th) of a pin, they will be much more productive: Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day. Economists have recognized two reasons why specialization improves productivity. Armen Alchian and William Allen present these two arguments in their textbook Universal Economics. The first reason specialization improves productivity is that some producers naturally have a lower production cost. As such, specialization allows individuals to produce that which is the lowest cost for them. For example, a farmer in the US does not have an adequate climate to produce coffee for as low of a cost as a farmer in Honduras. Likewise, the Honduran farmers would have to sacrifice acres perfect for coffee growth in order to grow corn. To remedy these issues, the US farmer can specialize in corn while the Honduran farmer can specialize in coffee, and then the two can trade. The second source of the gains from specialization comes from learning by doing. People improve at just about any action via repetition. The same is true of production. If a tailor is responsible for producing all kinds of clothes, he will have relatively limited time to learn how to produce suit jackets well. If, instead, he only produces suit jackets, it seems reasonable to think this specialization will improve his skills. These benefits of specialization have made it commonplace in the modern world. Whereas historically everyone needed to know how to grow crops, mend clothes, chop down trees, and hunt for food, nowadays most people outsource these roles to experts who specialize in them. It’s unlikely that our society could have risen to its current heights of wealth without specialization. Hobbies: The Antidote to Over-Specialization Libertarian author Robert Heinlein provides a different perspective on specialization in his book Time Enough for Love: A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. What are we to make of Heinlein’s quote here—does this undermine the importance of specialization in society? I don’t think so. Nowhere does this quote imply that specialized jobs are without benefits. Rather, Heinlein appears to be arguing that people should be well-rounded regardless of their careers. Heinlein is saying that every man should be a Renaissance Man. So how can someone whose job it is to program computers learn how to design a building, write a sonnet, or build a wall? Put simply, many of the activities Heinlein lists above are hobbies. Admittedly, some of the things on the above list extend beyond the realm of hobbies (I don’t know any amateur bone-setters), but many people learn these things today through their own interests. One of the benefits of hobbies, then, is that they insure us against the biggest downside of specialization: fragility. If everyone only knows how to do the work associated with his or her own station, what happens if someone doesn’t show up to his station? The whole production process gets stalled. Imagine, for example, if delivery trucks stopped coming to your local grocery store. How would you get food? Likely, many people don’t have a good answer to this question. Those who have taken up hunting or forestry as a hobby likely do have a good answer because they’ve achieved diversification through hobbies. This is an extreme example, to be sure, but it is representative of the downside of specialization and the attendant upside of hobbies. We can imagine a milder example (one that is personally relatable). Let’s say a winter storm strikes and all your local auto repair shops are backed up. The snow causes something on the bottom of your car to become dislodged, and it occasionally scrapes on the pavement. Maybe, once upon a time in history, car owners would know the necessary information to diagnose the problem themselves. However, in the era of specialization, you are used to taking your car to a specialist. What’s the remedy here? Well, you could wait several weeks for an auto repair shop, or you could call on a friend who is a car hobbyist. Your friend might not be a professional, but his experience might be enough to make up for your ignorance. At least that’s how it worked out for me, and this example shows exactly how hobbies build resilience. So if you’re not sure what to do for a resolution this year, get yourself a hobby. Heinlein’s list provides a pretty good idea of where to start. About the author: Peter Jacobsen is a Writing Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.

The Deep State Wins Again: All The Ways ‘We The People’ Keep Losi...	Almost one month into the Trump presidency, and the Constitution and the entire section on the various branches of government and how they work together are still missing from the White House website. This is no small thing. This omission, deliberate or inadvertent, speaks volumes about the priorities of this current administration. It also explains a lot about the legal mindset that is driving the Trump train, which continues to push forward with a theory of unitary executive power. You know what is not driving the Trump government? Any sense that it is bound by the rule of law, i.e, the U.S. Constitution. As Trump recently declared, 'He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.' Then again, Trump has never made any pretense of his aspirations to rule as a strongman. As the Washington Post reports: In 2017, he claimed 'an absolute right to do what I want with the Justice Department.' In 2019, he claimed that Article II of the Constitution gave him 'the right to do whatever I want as president.' In 2020, he said he could override state and local public health orders related to the coronavirus pandemic by saying: 'When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that’s the way it’s got to be. It’s total.' In 2022, he said that purported voter fraud in the 2020 election 'allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.' In 2023, he mused that he would be a dictator, but only on Day One of his presidency. And a year ago, he argued that presidents should have total immunity from criminal prosecution, even for 'EVENTS THAT ‘CROSS THE LINE.’ ' Listen, when someone shows you who they are, believe them. Then again, maybe the majority of Americans just don’t care about the Constitution anymore. Maybe, as journalist Zeynep Tufekci suggests, Americans want an authoritarian leader who embraces an 'ends-justify-the-means leadership style.' Maybe all they care about are the 'endless wins' that the Trump administration never ceases to claim for itself, but if we’re being brutally honest about the state of the country, 'we the people' are on a solid losing streak. While the team colors and the police state’s outward allegiances may have changed, from a constitutional perspective, we’re still losing in all the ways that matter, and the Deep State is still winning. Indeed, far from protecting our freedoms, the Trump administration is taking the Deep State’s unconstitutional disregard for civil liberties to new extremes. When you step away from the polarizing rhetoric and government spin long enough to look at the many ways in which the American police state is continuing to lockdown our freedoms, you’ll notice that not much has changed for the better. Has the Trump administration put an end to the police state’s use of surveillance on the American people? Has it scaled back the deployment of military forces domestically in violation of Posse Comitatus? Has it ceased the government’s war on cash? Has it stepped back from the NDAA’s threat of indefinite detentions? Has it de-militarized the police? Has it kicked the oligarchs out of the government’s inner circle? Has it been transparent and accountable in all of its dealings? The answer to all of those questions is a resounding 'no.' Rather than minimizing the power of the police state, the Trump administration appears to be doubling down on its commitment to police state tactics of fear, intimidation and brutality. Consider for yourselves. Free speech is still being undermined. The First Amendment prohibits the government from suppressing free speech activities by the public, the media, protesters, religious individuals, or by restricting the right of the people to assemble and associate with one another, yet we no longer have any real freedom of speech. We are moving fast down a slippery slope to an authoritarian society in which the only opinions, ideas and speech expressed are the ones permitted by the government and its corporate cohorts. In more and more cases, the government is declaring war on what should be protected political speech whenever it challenges the government’s power, reveals the government’s corruption, exposes the government’s lies, and encourages the citizenry to push back against the government’s many injustices. The ramifications are so far-reaching as to render almost every American who criticizes the government an extremist in word, deed, thought or by association. Although President Trump issued an executive order denouncing government censorship, primarily for speech with which he agrees, his administration has ostensibly engaged in a campaign of intimidation and coercion against news organizations that dare to disagree with or criticize his administration, as well as whistleblowers. Likewise, under the guise of fighting politically correct DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies and cancel culture, the Trump administration is engaging in its own campaign to cancel out expressive activities and content of which it disapproves, including anti-war protests. We’re still being subjected to expansive surveillance. All of the monitoring tools and weapons in the government’s surveillance arsenal that are being used to identify, track and target those on the Trump’s administration’s enemies list—facial recognition, biometrics, license plate readers, fusion centers, cell phone location tracking, etc.—can and will be used against the American people. AI surveillance harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and widespread surveillance technology to do what the police state lacks the manpower and resources to do efficiently or effectively: be everywhere, watch everyone and everything, monitor, identify, catalogue, cross-check, cross-reference, and collude. Everything that was once private is now up for grabs to the right buyer. With every new AI surveillance technology that is adopted and deployed without any regard for privacy, Fourth Amendment rights and due process, the rights of the citizenry are being marginalized, undermined and eviscerated. The government’s police powers are still being weaponized. With Trump claiming the power to target anyone or any group he perceives as a 'threat,' i.e., an 'enemy from within,' anyone who disagrees with the government could be placed on a government watch list. Having transformed local law enforcement into extensions of the military, the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI are turning the nation’s police officers into techno-warriors, complete with iris scanners, body scanners, thermal imaging Doppler radar devices, facial recognition programs, license plate readers, cell phone extraction software, Stingray devices and so much more. Government whistleblowers are still being persecuted. While claiming to be rooting out inefficiency, the Trump administration has been methodically dismantling all of the agencies charged with acting as nonpartisan watchdogs of government corruption. Americans are still being treated as suspects. The groundwork has been laid for a new kind of government where it won’t matter if you’re innocent or guilty, whether you’re a threat to the nation, or even if you’re a citizen. What will matter is what the government—or whoever happens to be calling the shots at the time—thinks. And if the powers-that-be think you’re a threat to the nation and should be locked up, then you’ll be locked up with no access to the protections our Constitution provides. Having launched a precrime programduring his first administration, the Trump administration would have no qualms about using AI predictive and surveillance technologies to classify, segregate and flag the populace. We’re still unofficially under martial law. We have what the founders feared most: a 'standing' or permanent army on American soil. This de facto standing army is made up of weaponized, militarized domestic police forces which look like, dress like, and act like the military; are armed with guns, ammunition and military-style equipment; are authorized to make arrests; and are trained in military tactics. With Trump having pledged to deploy the military domestically to work in conjunction with local police to address domestic threats, including political enemies, dissenters and immigrants, the American homeland is increasingly being transformed into a battlefield. We’re still being flagged based on our viewpoints, activities and associations. The government has a growing list—shared with fusion centers and law enforcement agencies—of ideologies, behaviors, affiliations and other characteristics that could flag someone as suspicious and result in their being labeled potential enemies of the state. Before long, every household in America will be flagged as a threat and assigned a threat score. It’s just a matter of time before you find yourself wrongly accused, investigated and confronted by police based on a data-driven algorithm or risk assessment culled together by a computer program run by artificial intelligence. Police shootings of unarmed citizens will continue. In the wake of Trump’s decision to reverse and revoke many of the policies intended to implement police reform and discourage police misconduct and stem the time of police brutality, we can expect the use of excessive force by police to continue unabated. We still don’t have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called 'economic elite.' Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. In other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism—a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. We still have an imperial president. Although President Trump has made no secret of his authoritarian impulses, he is not the first president to rule by fiat through the use of executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements. These unchecked powers enable all sitting president to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution. In other words, the seeds of chaos are still being sown, and it’s the U.S. government that will reap the harvest. My friends, if this is winning, I can’t imagine what losing will look like, but it won’t be pretty. All of this dismantling of government agencies, weakening of the economy, and fomenting of civil unrest feeds right back into the Deep State’s plot to destabilize the nation. Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command which anticipated that all hell would break loose by 2030? That’s barely five short years away now, but we’re being moved steadily in that direction. According to 'Megacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity,' the U.S. military plans to use armed forces to solve future domestic political and social problems. What they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security. The training video is only five minutes long, but it says a lot about the government’s mindset, the way its views the citizenry, and the so-called 'problems' that the government must be prepared to address in the near future through the use of martial law. Even more troubling, however, is what this military video doesn’t say about the Constitution, about the rights of the citizenry, and about the dangers of locking down the nation and using the military to address political and social problems. Be warned: in the future envisioned by the government, we will not be viewed as Republicans or Democrats. Rather, 'we the people' will be enemies of the state. For years, the government has been warning against the dangers of domestic terrorism, erecting surveillance systems to monitor its own citizens, creating classification systems to label any viewpoints that challenge the status quo as extremist, and training law enforcement agencies to equate anyone possessing anti-government views as a domestic terrorist. What the government failed to explain was that the domestic terrorists would be of the government’s own making, and that 'we the people' would become enemy #1. We’re already enemies of the state. You want to bring about real change? Start by wresting back control of our government from the oligarchs, technocrats and Deep State operatives who are still running the show. Reject the propaganda and the polarizing rhetoric and the 'us vs. them' tactics that reduce the mass power of the populace to warring, powerless factions. Find common ground with your fellow citizens and push back against the government’s brutality, inhumanity, greed, corruption and power grabs. Be dangerous in the best way possible: by thinking for yourself, by refusing to be silenced, by choosing sensible solutions over political expediency and bureaucracy. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, the solution to what ails this country is really not that complicated: decency, compassion, common sense, generosity balanced by fiscal responsibility, fairness, a commitment to freedom principles, and a firm rejection of the craven, partisan politics of the Beltway elites who have laid the groundwork for the Deep State’s ongoing authoritarian coup d’etat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdX7ZbZUArG_AE	2025-02-19T16:39:34-08:00	
The Trump-Musk Cultural Revolution – OpEd	The aging leader wanted to shake up his country, so he launched a second revolution with the help of a cadre of young people. Drunk with power, the leader targeted his enemies, remade his political party, and turned his own government into a self-destructing circus. Anyone with real expertise was sent far away from the political center. Intellectuals of all kinds came under suspicion. And the young people who rose up in support of the aging leader ran roughshod through society. They might not seem to have a lot in common, Mao Zedong and Donald Trump. The Communist leader, having come to power through a revolutionary war, harbored a visceral hatred for capitalism. The American businessman shirked military service, won the presidency (twice) through democratic elections, and harbors a visceral hatred for communism. And yet, Trump is currently involved in a cultural revolution as thoroughgoing in its ambitions and potential destructiveness as what Mao unleashed in China in the mid-1960s. You Say You Want a Revolution? At one level, what Donald Trump and his minions are doing is regime change, as Anne Applebaum has argued. They aren’t reforming U.S. government. They are transforming its operating system, courtesy of Elon Musk and his inaptly named Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Regime change is certainly part of the Trump game plan. He has borrowed this strategy from Viktor Orban, who turned Hungary’s political system based on liberal principles into a patronage system run along illiberal lines. The Orban transformation relied on a compliant legislature that allowed him to concentrate power in the executive. Once a leading liberal, the Hungarian leader knew how to deconstruct the Hungarian political system from the inside by stacking the courts, suppressing civil society, and controlling a right-wing media. You’d think that regime change would be enough for Trump. He is a man of unpredictable utterances but rather constrained ambitions. He wants to punish his enemies, reward his friends, stay out of jail, and secure his financial and political legacy. Those around Trump, however, are pushing for something more extreme. They have cast him in the role of the Great Helmsman—Mao’s favorite moniker—who steers American society into turbulent, uncharted waters. Team MAGA wants a 'second American Revolution' that roots out all vestiges of progressivism, liberalism, and secularism and that 'will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,' according to Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation. By 'left,' Roberts means anyone who follows the Constitution, acknowledges the importance of international law, and has a moral conscience. This more revolutionary program owes much to Chairman Mao who, in 1966, decided that Chinese society was so infected with various strains of reformism (capitalism, liberalism, traditionalism) that it, too, needed another revolution. On top of that, Mao unleashed the power of populism—the 'masses' in the vernacular of that time and place—to eliminate his political enemies. 'It was a power struggle waged… behind the smokescreen of a fictitious mass movement,' writes Belgian scholar Pierre Ryckmans. In the 1950s, after the country’s first revolution, Chinese society remained fundamentally conservative. The economy was primarily agrarian and Confucianism was still strong, particularly in the countryside. China was also elitist, with a Communist leader like Zhou Enlai born into the mandarin class and Mao himself coming from wealthy landowning stock. The Communists didn’t just aspire to change China’s governance. They wanted to turn Chinese society into something considerably more urban, industrial, secular, literate, and egalitarian. The change would be violent, if necessary, because Mao believed that 'revolution was not a dinner party' (one wonders if Kevin Roberts has a copy of the Little Red Book on his bedside table). At first, Mao relied on the Party and its repressive institutions to effect change. By the mid-1950s, he launched an effort at reform, the Thousand Flowers Campaign, that spiraled out of the Party’s control, which generated the backlash of the Anti-Rightist Campaign. That was, in turn, followed by the disastrous economic experiments of the Great Leap Forward. These whiplash changes in policy created considerable anxiety among the Chinese leadership that the Party, and the revolution more generally, was losing its hold over the population, which understandably didn’t know where to turn. Mao ultimately decided that only another revolution could break the country’s ties with its past. The agents of Mao’s Cultural Revolution were the Red Guards, teenagers who heeded Mao’s call for transformation by taking the law into their own hands. They attacked capitalist-roaders, 'bourgeois' teachers, and ultimately each other. Chinese society descended into such chaos that some people even fled over the border into North Korea, which was seen as a place of relative sanity. That’s how violent, unpredictable, and apocalyptic China was during the Cultural Revolution, which lasted nearly a decade until Mao’s death in 1976. Trumpists have their counterpart to Mao’s desire for revolutionary transformation: a plan to destroy everything in the federal government except the royal presidency and the Pentagon, and privatize everything in the country that has a tinge of the public to it. The Trumpian equivalents of the Red Guards are a motley crew. There’s 'Big Balls,' 19-year-old Edward Coristine, a DOGE-employed hacker who, among other questionable ventures, administers 'an AI-powered Discord bot operating in Russia.' Then there’s 25-year-old Marco Elez, a DOGE staffer who resigned after the revelation of his racist tweets (but whom Musk has promised to rehire). The parallel with China is not precise, since there are plenty of non-teenagers who are involved in this insurrection, including the middle-aged January 6 rioter Peter Marocco, who is slated to head up USAID. Whatever their age, however, these Trumpists are true believers, enthusiastically feeding democracy into the woodchipper. Mao, of course, wanted to pull China into a modern future. Trump and company promise something more high-tech, but they are really more interested in dragging the United States back to an imagined past. Why Trumpians Take Culture Seriously The Trump administration’s attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are not just a response to some recent fad. They are, as in China, an effort to radically revamp the very culture. Since the 1960s, the United States has become a more inclusive country, which has necessarily meant that white men have lost some part of their privileged positions in education, employment, and entertainment. By the 2000s, the United States still had a long way to go, but in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, anti-racism books were on the best-seller list, major corporations were examining their hiring and promoting policies, and educational institutions were finally beginning to address structural racism. Cultural transformations always move two steps forward and one step backward. In this case, the backlash has been much more intense, with Trump and company eager to rewind the clock to before the various civil rights movements, back even before the Fourteenth Amendment that added birthright citizenship to the Constitution in 1868. The Trump administration has tried to impose gender categories that define the trans community out of existence. It is restricting abortion access at home and abroad, fulfilling the candidate’s promise to help women 'whether they like it or not.' In the same way that Mao tried to make everything in China public—business, meals, child-rearing—Trump wants to privatize everything from schools to the post office. He is opening up government to conservative Christians, and religious institutions are poised to claw back as much public power as they can get. Mao thought that he was pushing with history’s tide. China’s current capitalist trajectory suggests otherwise, even though the regime change implemented by the Communist Party has remained more or less intact. The Party remains in charge, but the culture shows few enduring influences of the Cultural Revolution. With far-right politicians on the rise around the world, Trump and Musk similarly believe that they are on the cutting edge of change. But mass deportations and boosted birthrates among 'tradwives' won’t prevent America from losing its white-majority status in about 20 years. DEI is no fad. It is an accurate reflection of demographics. And short of imposing totalitarian control and setting up concentration camps, the MAGA crowd won’t be able to alter this trajectory. Welcome Back to 2025 This is not the first time I’ve written about the parallels between Trump and Mao’s Cultural Revolution. In 2022, safely ensconced in the Biden era but plagued by nightmares of the future, I wrote an article entitled 'The Terrifying World of 2025' for TomDispatch. It was/is a world of mass deportations, where 'Social Security checks and Medicare benefits have been delayed because the federal bureaucracy has shrunk to near invisibility.' Here was my look into the future, which is now our present: On his first day in office, the president signaled his new policy by authorizing a memorial on the Capitol grounds to the 'patriots' of January 6th and commissioning a statue of the QAnon shaman for the Rotunda. He then appointed people to his cabinet who not only lacked the expertise to manage their departments but were singularly devoted to destroying the bureaucracies beneath them, not to speak of the country itself. He put militia leaders in key Defense Department roles and similarly filled the courts with extremists more suited to playing reality-show judges than real life ones. In all of this, the president has been aided by a new crop of his very own legislators, men and women who know nothing about Congress and actively flouted its rules and traditions even as they made the MAGA caucus the dominant voting bloc. My piece focused on one part of this nightmare scenario—the dispatch of all newly unemployed federal employees, academics, and journalists to take the jobs vacated by deported immigrants. That has yet to take place, but Musk’s acquisition of all federal data could serve as the basis for a MAGA Corps of workers that fill the gaps in the private sector. The Trump team is currently stress-testing U.S. democracy to see where and how it breaks. Perhaps if we can hold the line here, in these opening months of the Trump-Musk cultural revolution, we can avoid all the mayhem and destruction that China experienced in the 1960s. Back in 2022, I was not optimistic in my crystal-ball-gazing: I know this nightmare won’t end overnight. China’s Cultural Revolution stretched on for nearly a decade and resulted in as many as two million dead. Our now-captive media doesn’t report on the growing violence in this country, but we’ve heard rumors about mobs attacking a courageous podcaster in Georgia and vigilantes targeting a lone abortion provider in Texas. Things might get a lot worse before they get better. Things could indeed get a lot worse. The mass deportations haven’t begun in earnest. The courts have hit pause on a number of Trump’s more egregious moves. The worst of the new Cabinet members—Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—have yet to make their marks. But I’d like to believe that Trump and Musk, for all the power they currently deploy, are basically spitting into the wind. But it’s up to us, with every breath we take, to make sure that all that ugly spittle ends up back on the face of MAGA.

Excluded From Talks, Bruised By Trump, Zelenskyy Calls For ‘More ...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- With the most consequential talks his country has faced in decades proceeding without his country’s involvement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy punched back -- at doubters, at Russia, and, most notably, at U.S. President Donald Trump. At a news conference in Kyiv on February 18, Zelenskyy tried to reclaim a narrative that has been spinning out of his reach this week, as senior U.S. and Russian officials met for the first time since before Russia’s launched its all-out onslaught on Ukraine three years ago. And he sharply criticized the Trump administration – an unusually pointed swipe directed at Kyiv’s biggest supplier of weaponry and military equipment. 'I believe that the United States helped Putin to break out of years of isolation,' Zelenskyy said. 'All of this has no positive impact on Ukraine.' Trump, he charged, is pushing 'a lot of information that is coming from Russia.' Anxiety is spiking in Kyiv – not to mention in many supportive European capitals – as Washington and Moscow moved forward this week to lay the groundwork for a possible peace settlement to end the war. Adding further to the angst: comments, a day earlier, by Trump, who falsely suggested that Ukraine had started the war and, also inaccurately, that Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular among Ukrainians. He also said that a new presidential election should be held. Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy again on February 19, calling him a 'dictator' and suggesting he must agree to a peace deal soon. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Here’s what you need to know-- not only about Zelenskyy’s news conference but what is shaping up to be one of the most trying weeks of his wartime leadership. Zelenskyy: Outside Looking In Zelenskyy had been scheduled to fly to the Saudi capital of Riyadh on February 19 a day after top U.S. and Russian officials met face-to-face to lay the groundwork for peace talks. Those were the first formal high-level talks between Washington and Moscow since before the February 2022 invasion. Despite some assurances, and calls from European leaders, to make sure Ukrainian officials are involved in the negotiations, Ukraine has pointedly been left out – at least this initial stage. Hours after the U.S.-Russian talks wrapped up on February 18, Zelenskyy, on a previously planned trip to Turkey, made clear his position – and his displeasure. 'Decisions on how to end the war in Ukraine cannot be made without Ukraine, nor can any conditions be imposed,' he told reporters. 'We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us, I think for many others as well.' Trump Disses Zelenskyy If the launch of direct U.S.-Russian talks without Ukraine wasn’t disturbing enough for Zelenskyy, Trump’s blistering criticism likely was. 'Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,' Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. 'They had a seat at the table for three years,' Trump said, referring to Ukraine. 'When they are worried about not being seated, they could have made a deal long ago.' 'I like him personally,' he said, referring to Zelenskyy, 'but it is the leadership that allowed the war to go on.' Russia in fact started the all-out war on February 24, 2022, sending tens of thousands of troops across the border after months of military buildup and threats aimed directly at Kyiv. They included ultimatums to shrink its army, commit to neutrality, and recognize Russia-backed forces who had seized power in the part of the eastern Donbas region in 2014 with direct military and other support from Moscow. It wasn’t entirely clear what talks or 'table' Trump was referencing, but there have been no negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow since the first few months after the February 2022 invasion. Those talks produced drafts of a potential deal but petered out late that April, as the sides wrangled over points of dispute after revelations of alleged Russian war crimes emerged in the town of Bucha. In his comments on February 18, Trump also asserted that Zelenskyy was now deeply unpopular, and he suggested that the country must hold elections. 'We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law…in Ukraine,' Trump said. 'And the leader of Ukraine, I hate to say it, he’s down at 4 percent approval rating. In fact, a poll released earlier this month that compared possible candidates for the presidency found that Zelenskyy’s trust ratings remained in the double digits, though he lagged behind Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief who is now ambassador to Britain, and two other public figures. A separate survey released February 19 by the respected Kyiv International Institute for Sociology, showed that Zelenskyy’s trust rating had climbed to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in December. Zelenskyy used his Kyiv news conference to accuse Trump of parroting Russia’s positions on the causes and the conditions of the war. 'As we are talking about 4 percent, we have seen this disinformation, we understand it's coming from Russia,' Zelenskyy told reporters. 'We have evidence that these figures are being discussed between America and Russia,' Zelenskyy said, though he did not describe the evidence. 'Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect for him as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly, is living in this disinformation bubble.' The issue of new elections in Ukraine is complex. The country is indeed under martial law, declared by Zelenskyy shortly after the start of the invasion and prolonged repeatedly since then, which precludes holding voting. Moreover, the logistics of organizing balloting and voting precinct at a time of war – never mind in territories currently occupied by Russia – is near impossible. Russian President Vladimir Putin has used the issue to bash Zelenskyy; on the eve of the Riyadh talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov once again questioned the Ukrainian president’s 'legitimacy.' While Zelenskyy remains broadly popular, as Ukrainians have rallied around a wartime leader, Ukrainians are also exhausted and in some cases frustrated by government decision on issues like manpower. Some prominent political figures, such as former President Petro Poroshenko, have made signals that they might mount a challenge to Zelenskyy if an election were held. Zelenskyy said Trump’s comments parroted the Russian remarks. 'I would like President Trump’s team to have more truth,' Zelenskyy said. Kellogg’s In Town Zelenskiy’s news conference on February 19 came shortly before he was scheduled to meet with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. Kellogg did not attend the Riyadh talks, and it’s unclear how central he will be to Trump’s thinking as negotiations coalesce. However, he has voiced at times a relatively hard line toward Moscow. Arriving at a Kyiv train station, Kellogg said his visit was 'a chance to have some good, substantial talks.' 'We understand the need for security guarantees,' he said. 'It’s very clear to us the importance of the sovereignty of this nation and the independence of this nation as well,' he said. 'Part of my mission is to sit and listen.'

Nenad Nesic: The Rise And Dramatic Fall Of Bosnia’s Former Securi...	By Azem Kurtic Over two decades, Nenad Nesic went from police officer to politician to one of the most powerful cabinet ministers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His relentless rise and growing real estate portfolio were shadowed by allegations of corruption. As a young police officer, Nenad Nesic used to put people behind bars. Now, Bosnia’s former security minister is the one sitting in a cell. In just under two decades, the 46-year-old went from police cadet to the civilian head of Bosnia’s security agencies, while simultaneously amassing an impressive real estate portfolio worth millions of euros. Last year, he claimed never to have taken a bank loan. 'I bought everything legally,' he said. 'With my own earnings. I have a salary, you have all the records, I paid for everything legally through the bank where I receive my salary. I paid for everything without a loan.' The money might not have come from the bank, but prosecutors say it wasn’t from Nesic’s salary either. On December 26, Nesic was arrested on charges of corruption, abuse of office, money laundering and bribe-taking during his tenure as acting director of the public road company in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s predominantly Serb-populated Republika Srpska entity. He resigned in January, on 'moral grounds'. Prosecutors allege Nesic put pressure on road maintenance companies to buy materials from a private company called Legend. Six others were also arrested. Nesic’s Democratic People’s Alliance, DNS party, which he leads, condemned the case against him as 'politically motivated'. DNS senior official Darko Banjac said his arrest was 'part of a broader political pressure campaign against the Serb people'. In his resignation letter, Nesic said that 'I do not acknowledge the commission of the criminal offence for which I am in detention. I will prove my innocence in the court proceedings ahead.' Climb to power According to Nesic’s official biography, he graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Novi Sad in northern Serbia in 2005, becoming a police trainee in East Sarajevo, Bosnia, where he was born. Nesic climbed to the rank of inspector, though there is little available public information on his role or performance during the period up to 2014, when he swapped his police uniform for suit and joined the DNS. Again, he climbed the ladder, first becoming head of the East Sarajevo municipal branch of the party, before finally being elected party leader in 2020. In October 2022, Nesic ran unsuccessfully for the Serb post on Bosnia’s tripartite presidency. When the DNS joined the state-level government, he became security minister, the Bosnian equivalent of interior minister or Britain’s home secretary. Nesic’s appointment was not without controversy, after he failed security checks conducted by the State Intelligence Agency, OSA, and yet still enjoyed access to classified information in his role in charge of the police, border service, OSA and other agencies. It was around this time that Nesic went from critic of Republika Srpska strongman Milorad Dodik to outspoken defender, calling the entity president’s ongoing trial before the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina – for flouting the decisions of the international community’s Bosnia peace overseer – 'an attack on the Republika Srpska and the Serb people'. More controversy came in October 2024, when Nesic’s security detail was reported to authorities for allegedly breaking the arm of an off-duty Sarajevo police officer while trying to clear a path for the minister’s motorcade through the city’s rush-hour traffic. Corruption allegations The charges against Nesic stem from his time as acting director of Roads of Republika Srpska, between 2016 and 2020. According to prosecutors, during this period Nesic took a total of one million Bosnian marks in bribes, or roughly half a million euros. It started, prosecutors say, when a company called Romanijaputevi won a tender worth two million marks, and its director, Milan Pandurevic, was allegedly told 'to allocate ten per cent of the tender value to Roads of RS for their needs'. Prosecutors say the money was funnelled to Nesic. They also allege that firms contracted to maintain Republika Srpska’s road were instructed to buy materials exclusively from Legend, whose director was Mladen Lucic. 'The money was then funnelled back into the hands of Nenad Nesic through Lucic,' the prosecution said. 'This was carried out in cafés, offices, parking lots, rest stops, and restaurants in Jahorina [mountain area near Sarajevo]. This continued while Nesic was the director of Roads of Republika Srpska.' A five-year investigation, involving wiretaps and physical surveillance, culminated in the arrests of Nesic, Legend owner Lucic and the current acting director of Roads of RS, Milan Dakic, all of whom remain in custody. Three other executives at Roads of RS – Srdjan Mijatovic, Cvijetin Milivojevic, and Mladen Cajic – were also arrested. Pandurevic, of Romanijaputevi, was taken in for questioning the same day but released that evening. Real estate empire As acting director of Roads of Republika Srpska, Nesic’s salary was roughly 1,500 euros per month. As security minister, he earned some 2,800 euros per month. Yet somehow, he, his wife and his brother, Predrag, amassed a total of 17 properties or plots in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro, including two apartments in a luxury marina for superyachts called Porto Montenegro in Tivat, Montenegro, according to his official property declaration when he became a minister. Similar apartments in the complex are listed for sale at more than a million euros each. Nesic also owns properties in the Montenegrin coastal town of Budva, in East Sarajevo and Novi Sad, his property declaration revealed. His wife, Maja, owns 10,000 sqm of land in Serbia, while his brother, Predrag, owns an apartment in the Montenegrin coastal town of Herceg Novi and land in Sarajevo, East Ilidza and East Sarajevo. Nesic’s assets also include the companies N-Group d.o.o., led by his wife, N Trade d.o.o., owned by his brother, and DAR, owned by his father. He also has a BMW and a Mercedes. Of these companies, only N Trade is in the black. Its profits soared from 30,000 in 2021 to almost 1.2 million euros in 2022. Nesic was not at home when police came knocking on December 26. He handed himself in at the police station in East Sarajevo where he began his career. He told waiting reporters: 'I love you Republika Srpska, and I will never stop fighting for you.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LKrlxG7vNvOO	2025-02-19T16:34:53-08:00	
EU Forges Ahead With ‘Independent’ Russia Sanctions Policy Amid M...	By Thomas Moller-Nielsen (EurActiv) -- EU envoys agreed on a further round of sanctions on Russia on Wednesday amid conflicting signals from the United States about the future of Washington’s own regime of restrictive measures aimed at Moscow. The new sanctions package – the EU’s 16th since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – includes import bans on aluminium, export restrictions on chromium and other items used to produce factory equipment, and the removal of multiple Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system. It also includes additional measures to clamp down on Russia’s circumvention of the G7’s oil price cap, which limits the sale of Russian seaborne oil to $60 per barrel. The move, which came the day after US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia to discuss an end to the three-year-long Ukraine war, followed a meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels at which officials reaffirmed their support for the bloc’s current sanctions policy. One European official familiar with Tuesday’s discussions said that it is 'very likely' that the EU’s sanctions policy 'could evolve independently' of the US over the coming months, as it remains unclear what course US President Donald Trump might steer after his initial steps toward patching up ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'I did not detect any reduction in commitment to the implementation of our sanctions package,' the official said. 'And therefore I don't see it likely that if the US was to go in a different direction we would follow.' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had initially suggested after his meeting with Russian officials on Tuesday that Washington could ease sanctions on Moscow as part of any ceasefire arrangement – and hinted that the EU might be compelled to follow suit. 'Sanctions are all the result of this conflict,' Rubio said, noting that 'in order to bring an end to any conflict there has to be concessions made by all sides'. 'But there are other parties that have sanctions,' he added. 'The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.' But Bloomberg subsequently reported that Rubio had privately informed several European counterparts that Washington would maintain its raft of sanctions on Moscow until the war is over, citing people familiar with the matter. A State Department spokesperson also confirmed on Tuesday that Rubio had briefed ministers from France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat, 'immediately' after the meeting in Riyadh. 'The group agreed to remain in close contact as we work to achieve a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine,' the spokesperson said. The EU's sanctions require unanimous support among the EU's 27 member states and must be renewed every six months. One EU diplomat noted that Trump's close relationship with Hungary's Viktor Orbán – who has repeatedly denounced the EU's sanctions – could lead to 'problems' if Washington pressured Brussels to lift sanctions on Moscow. 'If this scenario would happen [where] Trump asked EU to ease up with the sanctions, I'm pretty sure that there will be at least one head of state who will be willing to do that,' the diplomat said. A controversial confiscation Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, also said on Tuesday that Warsaw is sticking with its controversial push to confiscate the €210 billion in frozen Russian assets currently held in the EU. Such a move has been fiercely resisted by Belgium, where the vast majority of the assets are based. Belgian leaders have argued that seizing the assets is legally dubious and could threaten the financial stability of the eurozone. Confiscation is, however, staunchly supported by many Eastern European countries and was also strongly endorsed by the previous US administration led by Joe Biden. The profits generated by these assets are currently being used to finance a $50 billion loanto Kyiv, following an agreement last year by G7 countries. 'Of course, we do believe that these assets should be used to benefit Ukraine and not only the profits, but also the assets [themselves],' Domański said at a Bloomberg-hosted event. 'Having said that, of course, there are countries that express their position which is different,' he added. 'So we are in ongoing discussions – it would be premature to say what could be the end for that.' European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis, who has also repeatedly refusedto rule out seizing the assets, also suggested yesterday that the EU’s sanctions policy could evolve independently of the US. 'I think it's very clear with the moves of the current Trump administration that EU will need to take issues related to its security more [into] its own hands,' he said, adding that this 'also concerns sanctions policy'. The EU has banned €91.2 billion worth of imports from Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as well as €48 billion in exports, according to the European Commission. The new sanctions package is set to be formally endorsed by EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LD_7JE5fHT_C	2025-02-19T16:32:01-08:00	
‘Time Is Running Out’ For Jailed Pro-Democracy Media Mogul Jimmy ...	By Alice Yam The son of jailed pro-democracy media magnate Jimmy Lai has warned that 'time is running out' for his father’s health, and called on Britain and the United States to push for his release. 'His body is breaking down ... It’s akin to torture,' Sebastien Lai told Reuters ahead of the Human Rights and Democracy summit in Geneva on Feb. 18. 'Time is running out for my father.' Lai, 77, has spent more than 1,500 days behind bars, and is diabetic. He is a British citizen. In jail since his arrest in December 2020, Lai is currently standing trial for 'collusion with foreign forces' under Hong Kong’s National Security Law. He has also been handed separate sentences for lighting a candle and praying for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, for irregularities in the use of his newspaper’s office space, and for taking part in the 2019 protests. Sebastien Lai called on global leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump — who has pledged to help get Lai out of jail — and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to take urgent action, as his father faces his fourth year of solitary confinement. 'We are incredibly grateful that [Trump] said that. It gives us a lot of hope,' Sebastien Lai said, but called for a stronger response from the United Kingdom. 'If (Britain) wants to normalize relations, they shouldn’t normalize citizens being arrested for standing up for democracy,' he said. The Hong Kong government told Reuters that Hong Kong 'strongly disapproves of and rejects misinformation and smearing remarks made by Sebastien Lai,' while China’s permanent mission in Geneva described the claims about Lai’s health as 'slanderous.' Sebastien Lai called on governments to 'champion' his father, who decided not to flee the city when Beijing imposed the first of two national security laws in 2020, despite knowing he’d be a target. 'He refused to leave,' he told Voice of America. 'Six decades after landing on the shore of this island in pursuit of freedom, he decided to stay and stand with his fellow protesters.' Human rights groups say Lai’s trial is a 'sham' and part of a broad crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong that has all but destroyed its reputation as the only place in Greater China where the rule of law and freedoms of speech and assembly were preserved. In November 2024, a Hong Kong court jailed 45 democracy supporters at the end of the city’s biggest national security trial to date. Those sentences drew international condemnation and calls for further sanctions on Hong Kong and the expansion of lifeboat visa schemes for those fleeing the political crackdown in the city.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LNXJS0wx9yAF	2025-02-19T16:27:12-08:00	
The Fall Of Eric Adams – OpEd	Eric Adams has a multitude of legal and political problems that have ended any political ambitions he may have had. Donald Trump may have kept him from going to jail, but in seeking a lifeline from a president hated by most New Yorkers, he has sealed his fate and will go down in history as the anti-Black, Black mayor. New York City residents are wondering if mayor Eric Adams will resign, or be removed from office by the governor, or be summoned to an Inability Committee , or limp along ineffectively until his term ends on December 31, 2025. The city’s mayoralty is hanging by a thread with four Deputy Mayors resigning, and top staff under indictment or leaving. Depending on a judge’s ruling, Adams may no longer be under indictment himself because Donald Trump interceded with the United States Attorney on his behalf. So egregious was the action that six prosecutors with solid republican bona fides resigned rather than sign onto the obvious travesty of justice. Adams denies agreeing to any quid pro quo with Trump but it is hard to believe him after his appearance on Fox and Friends with border czar Tom Homan. Homan felt quite comfortable beating up on the embattled mayor. 'If he doesn’t come through … I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city, the city that the people of New York love. Where the hell is the agreement we came to?' What was the agreement that caused Adams to humiliate himself on national television? He has promised to work with the Trump administration’s mass deportation plan and, in so doing, will end New York’s adherence to so-called sanctuary city status, which prevents city agencies from working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). No one should think of New York as being free from ICE enforcement because of sanctuary city virtue signaling. New York City is home to an ICE detention facility and New Yorkers can be and are deported on a regular basis. But those facts are inconvenient and the Trump administration obsession with deportation photo opportunities gives the appearance that he is the first president to ever deport anyone. Adams is charged with taking bribes and using straw donors , which included illegal donations from foreigners, to inflate his campaign contributions using New York City’s generous matching program, and netting his campaign a cool $10 million. While the judge hearing his case has still not officially dismissed it, Adams is believed to have escaped a trial and any jail time that might have resulted from a conviction. Others indicted on the same charges have already pleaded guilty . They will face conviction and possible jail time even if Adams succeeds in walking free. New York City’s second Black mayor is not only facing serious accusations, but he is no friend to the nearly 2 million Black residents he governs. The existence of ineffectual and compromised Black elected officials is not a new phenomenon. Adams stands out because of his policies which are so obviously harmful to Black people. Until recently the Adams administration took more than 30 days to process Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs (SNAP) and other public assistance applications, a violation of law and a cause of great suffering to low income people. Adams has also been slow to close the notorious Rikers Island jail, in defiance of the demands of a federal monitor. He did find time to be baptized at Rikers Island by none other than Al Sharpton in a Good Friday ceremony but he has stymied every effort at improving conditions there and eventually closing the facility. The New York Police Department (NYPD) remains a pet agency, allowed to violate the rules the mayor sets for others, including exceeding its overtime budget by $100 million . Adams fought against efforts to minimize the imposition of cash bail and worked with the governor to undo a process which impacted Black people more than any other group. Now under indictment himself, Adams bragged that other people presumed innocent should sit in jail because they lacked money to post a bond. When Luigi Mangione , the accused shooter of an insurance company executive was extradited to New York, Adams joined in the perp walk and trampled on Mangione’s presumption of innocence as he has done with others. 'I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city, the city that the people of New York love.' The right wing New York Post endorsed his 2021 campaign and the mayor made good on Rupert Murdoch’s seal of approval by constantly harping on crime as an issue even after major crimes decreased. He is so devoted to the state of Israel that he visits whenever that nation is in the midst of genocidal activity and in need of public relations campaigns to cover up its war crimes. Adams even mused about retiring to the occupied Golan Heights. Adams praised acquitted subway killer Daniel Penny who walked free after he choked a Black homeless Black man on a subway train. Adams said, 'You have someone [Penny] on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done as a city.' The hopefully soon to be former mayor also brought back the stop and friskpolicies which victimized so many Black New Yorkers. Other Black politicians go through the motions of meeting the needs of their Black constituents and speaking to their issues of concern. But Adams made it clear that the needs of conservative white New Yorkers would be his priority. While others make phony progressive promises, Adams panders to a group unlikely to support any other Black politician. Amidst the drama of his legal woes he met with republican leadership, presumably to seek their endorsement to run on their party’s ballot line. While he ultimately decided against this ploy, Adams is completely discredited. A small coterie of clergy will show up at a press conference to show support, but politically speaking, Adams is a dead man walking. While current and past office holders have already announced they are vying to sit in the mayor’s office, it is wise to determine how to prevent another political debacle for the city. Despite not having announced that he is running, former governor Andrew Cuomo has both name recognition and a long list of rich people ready to contribute to a campaign. Despite not making his candidacy official, he is the front runner for the mayoralty. As governor of New York state, Cuomo governed as a neo-liberal, currying favor with rich conservatives and carrying on a years-long feud with then New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. Cuomo also attempted to undo a state ethics commission which this week ruled that he should not have received a $5.1 payment for writing his memoirs while in office. Cuomo is smoother and smarter than Adams but brings the same bad political baggage. No one is certain how long the Adams soap opera will go on, but he will not be missed by the Black New Yorkers whose political and material needs he ignored. Eric Adams will be a footnote in history as a clownish and quirky character with legal troubles but whenever he leaves office, he will not be missed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LE4N6JyS2bBV	2025-02-19T16:23:07-08:00	
Trump Assails Ukraine’s Zelenskyy As ‘Dictator Without Elections’	U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, calling him a 'dictator without elections,' after Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space.' With settlement of Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine hanging in the balance, Trump took to his Truth Social media platform to attack the Kyiv leader, who has expressed the fear that the U.S. leader is trying to end the war on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Trump accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in 2022, three years ago next week. Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as 'a modestly successful comedian' who 'talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle.' The U.S. leader, who declined last year during a political debate to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war, said 'the only thing [Zelenskyy] was good at was playing [former U.S. President Joe] Biden ‘like a fiddle’' for more military assistance. 'I love Ukraine,' Trump said, 'but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Trump’s assessment of Zelenskyy came after the Ukrainian leader this week expressed his anger at Ukraine’s exclusion from Tuesday’s high-level U.S.-Russian diplomatic talks in Saudi Arabia, where the two countries after more than four hours of discussions said they had agreed to meet again soon on how to end the war. Earlier, Trump on Tuesday scoffed at Zelenskyy’s complaint about not being invited to the talks in Riyadh headed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 'Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders, whom he accused of starting the war even though it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he was pleased with the outcome of the Riyadh talks with the U.S. but said his country needs to build trust with Washington before the war can be resolved. Putin rated the discussions 'highly,' declaring that they were a 'first step' in improving contentious relations between Moscow and Washington. But he added, 'It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States.' Putin said in televised remarks that he would like to hold a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, 'but it needs to be prepared so that it brings results.' The Rubio-Lavrov talks were the first significant discussions between the two superpowers in more than three years following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the U.S.-led Western effort to arm Kyiv’s forces to fend off the attack. 'I was briefed [on the talks]. I rate them highly, there are results,' Putin was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying at a drone factory in Saint Petersburg. 'In my opinion, we made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests.' Neither Ukrainian nor European officials were at the table in a Saudi palace for the talks, but the U.S. said they would be involved in future negotiations to try to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. Russia failed to take over all of Ukraine in the first stages of the war but now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory. Zelenskyy has said repeatedly his country will not accept a dictated U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the conflict. While Biden provided tens of billions of dollars in arms for Kyiv, Trump has pushed for a fast end to the Moscow-initiated war. Speaking ahead of talks with Trump's Ukraine envoy in Kyiv, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian TV, 'President Trump ... unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.' The envoy, Gen. Keith Kellogg, said the United States understands the need for security guarantees for Ukraine in any negotiated end to the war. Kellogg said he was in Ukraine 'to listen,' hear the concerns of Ukrainian leaders and return to the United States to consult with Trump. Kellogg said the United States wants the war in Ukraine to end, saying it would be good for the region and the world. Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the meeting with Kellogg that while U.S. officials have said there will be no U.S. troops deployed as part of any potential post-war peacekeeping mission, there are still other ways it can help, such as providing air defense systems. 'You don't want boots on the ground, you don't want NATO,' Zelenskyy said. 'Okay, can we have Patriots? Enough Patriots?' The discussions in Kyiv came amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts focused on the war, including French President Emmanuel Macron hosting European leaders Wednesday for a second round of talks about the conflict and European support for Ukraine. Kellogg also met earlier this week with European leaders. Rubio said Tuesday after meeting with Lavrov that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to achieve peace. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters. Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the U.S.-Russia talks. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement after the Riyadh talks that the U.S. and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible.' Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LMtqLzIIrLXT	2025-02-19T16:21:16-08:00	
Ukraine: Three Years Of War Reverses Progress For Women And Girls	Three years of war in Ukraine have reversed decades of progress for women and girls, leaving millions in urgent need of support, according to UN Women. Russia’s full-scale invasion has forced more than 1.8 million women to flee their homes within Ukraine, while nearly 6.7 million require humanitarian assistance. More than 3,799 women and 289 girls have been killed, though the real toll is believed to be significantly higher. 'The full-scale war has pushed an entire generation of Ukrainian women backwards,' said Sabine Freizer Gunes, UN WomenRepresentative in the country. 'They are facing heightened exposure to gender-based violence; rising unemployment; decreased decision-making power; greater domestic burdens; and a severe mental health crisis,' she explained. Stressed out Gender-based violence has surged by 36 per cent since 2022, driven in part by conflict-related stress, UN Women reported. In parallel, depression rates among women and girls have worsened. On the economic front, opportunities have shrunk. By 2024, less than half of displaced women had jobs whilst the gender pay gap doubled since the beginning of the war. Meanwhile, the burden of unpaid care, from cooking to caring for children, has intensified as childcare services centres have closed and services dwindled. Women spent an average of 56 hours a week on childcare in 2024, up from 49 hours before the war. Leaders of humanitarian recovery Despite these hardships, Ukrainian women are leading humanitarian responses and driving economic resilience. Women have assumed key roles as aid workers, community leaders and entrepreneurs. Today, one in every two businesses in Ukraine is founded by a woman. Women are also entering traditionally male-dominated sectors such as security, transportation and demining. 'Donors’ support to Ukrainian women-led organizations and programmes is crucial so they can continue promoting gender equality, women’s rights and leadership,' said Ms. Gunes. 'Women’s full engagement will be essential to rebuild Ukraine as a gender-equal and gender-responsive society,' she added. Support and call for action In 2024 alone, UN Women supported more than 180,000 women and girls affected by the war through initiatives under the Women Peace and Humanitarian Fund. The agency provides life-saving humanitarian aid, psychosocial and legal support, protection services and programmes to strengthen women’s economic independence. Four years on since the beginning of the war, UN Women is working to ensure that women are included in decision-making and recovery efforts, advocating for legal reforms to secure equal rights and representation. Overnight attack on Odesa The UN aid coordination office in Ukraine, OCHA, reported that an attack on Odesa City in the small hours of Wednesday morning had injured a number of civilians, including a child. Local authorities say the attack left a large residential area without electricity and heating, affecting at least 160,000 people – in the midst of winter. 'Multiple apartment buildings were damaged, as well as a children’s hospital, and a kindergarten. For our part, we are providing emergency shelter materials, hot meals, psychosocial support, legal aid, and child protection services,' said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric., Medical teams are conducting quick health checks and distributing medicines, while schools will remain closed until power and heating are restored. In the southern city of Kherson aid workers are continuing to respond to an attack that took place on 17 February, and damaged a critical energy facility. 2,500 residents were left without electricity, heating, and water.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LCmjJbI5_Rua	2025-02-19T16:19:03-08:00	
I Sympathize With Nehru’s Views On The Importance Of Industrializ...	We put a lot of money into industry in the hope that this input would accelerate our growth. Jawaharlal Nehru's idea of the public sector was very different from the way it has evolved through the years. Whether you have a socialist or a capitalist economy, profits have always been the principal source of accumulation' said Dr Manmohan Singh, two-term India’s prime minister from 2004 to 2014 Ever since the passing away of Dr Manmohan Singh on 26 December 2024 in New Delhi, much has been written about his contributions as the two-term Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014, his historic role as the Union Finance Minister from 1991 to 1996. In the politically-charged atmosphere of the Indian capital, there have been debates on a memorial site and Bharat Ratna (highest civilian honour) for the late former Prime Minister; these continue to make media headlines, resulting in political tug-of-wars where decorum is often thrown to the winds. It is only appropriate to bring to centre-stage the mild-mannered soft-spoken Oxford-Cambridge educated Dr Manmohan Singh whose seminal works on exports, world trade, the role of public sector, and Pt Jawaharlal Nehru's vision continue to shed light on the roadmaps for the Indian economy till date. Back in 1999-2000 when he was Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parliament) Dr Singh, in a conversation with development economist Prof VN Balasubramanyam of Lancaster University, shared his views on a spectrum of issues relating to India’s economy. 'Yes, I sympathise with Nehru's views on the importance of industrialisation, indeed until the 1960s, there was no questioning of that policy. Yes, I subscribed to it, infact most of us did. It seemed the right strategy at that time,' said Dr Singh, adding 'Everybody who came to India also advocated that policy. Those were the days of the take-off into self-sustained growth. Whosoever came to India advised us that increasing investment to the right level was the thing to do. It was considered right that India should run a large deficit and the world would finance it. I do not think that till the mid-1960s we did terribly wrong. I think we should have had the vision to shift gear once we knew that we had created the basic infrastructure. We should have taken full advantage of the opportunities offered by the international trading system to build a dynamic and efficient economy. We should have paid more attention to restructuring of public and private enterprises on the basis of efficiency and international competitiveness.' Earlier in an interview with World Affairs (January-March 1997), Dr Singh explained, 'We have not paid adequate attention to social sectors in our development strategy. We adopted a strategy where steel was the kingpin, whereas we live in a society where knowledge is power. In a country such as ours where you have a literacy rate of 53 per cent with a dubious quality, it is not surprising that our growth rate is so low. We put a lot of money into industry in the hope that this input would accelerate our growth. Jawaharlal Nehru's idea of the public sector was very different from the way it has evolved through the years. Whether you have a socialist or a capitalist economy, profits have always been the principal source of accumulation. Therefore, if you socialise profits through the public sector, you will kill two birds with one stone: first, you accelerate the rate of saving through the prevention of superfluous consumption by the rich and thereby accelerate the process of accumulation; second, by socialising profits you can reduce the inequalities of income and wealth. Nehru hoped that we would have a public sector that would generate large surpluses. But the public sector in our economy doesn't even yield a return to pay the interest on the capital the government has borrow.' Dr Manmohan often gave the Japanese example, looking at the trajectory of Japanese development since the 19th century. 'They created a large number of enterprises in the public sector and handed them over to the private sector. If we wish to industrialise quickly within a period of 15-25 years in a country where the private entrepreneurs are scarce, active state involvement in setting up industries is the only way to get things going. But if the process is to become self-sustaining, we need a progressive increase in productivity, improved capital productivity. Public sector and state instrumentalities are very inefficient ways of getting this productivity growth. You have to rely on the private sector to do this,' he explained to Prof Balasubramanyam. Undoubtedly Dr Singh’s handling of the balance of payments crisis of 1991 was truly historic, and remains a milestone in India’s contemporary history. He narrated the sequence of events, typically as an economics professor would: 'India was in the middle of a deep economic crisis. We were on the verge of bankruptcy as our foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted. We converted that crisis into an opportunity to launch a wide-ranging programme of structural reforms. The traditional response to a balance of payments crisis is to compress domestic demand through a programme of fiscal retrenchment. However, in an economy characterised by wage rigidities and supply bottlenecks which prevent resources moving from one sector to another, the traditional stabilisation programmes end up by creating unemployment and idle capacity.' He then highlighted the strategy adopted, 'we devised a stabilisation programme which was expected to produce positive results in a fairly short period and additional we launched a programme of structural reforms to improve the supply side responses. The end result was that the duration of the recession resulting from the stabilisation programme was short enough to prevent a serious political backlash. By 1993-94, the Indian economy started growing at a fairly respectable rate. In this way, the political resistance to reforms was contained. Even then there were problems once the sense of crisis was over. This is partly because we did not have enough time to educate public opinion.' For economists wishing to learn from this lesson of history, the key points are – improving supply side responses, preventing political backlash, and educating public opinion. Dr Singh acknowledged the highly inward-looking economic policies, the strong distrust of foreign investment and private entrepreneurship which was prevalent till 1991. 'The distrust was a reflection of India's history whereby the East India Company, which came to India as a trader, ended up as a ruler. Our struggle against colonial rule also strengthened these sentiments. In this background, it was natural that the opening up of the economy to foreign investment and liberalisation of imports should invite opposition from businessmen, trade unions and even political parties both on the right and the left. However, the fact that ours was a policy of measured opening up, that our economic reforms did not lead to unemployment and idle capacity, and that the growth performance of the economy improved year after year after the initial setback in 1991-92 diluted the vigour of opposition to economic reforms. Now there is widespread appreciation that reforms of 1991 to 1996 on the whole were beneficial in their impact and there can be no reversal of these policies,' he said, obviously with an obvious sense of satisfaction. He referred to the opposition faced by the Congress-led government from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Leftist parties who were against the opening up of the economy. But after coming into power, 'both the United Front government and the BJP recognised that xenophobia is no answer to India's problems. However, the BJP government's soft line towards foreign investment and import liberalisation is being opposed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Swadeshi Jagran Manch. In fact all the political parties contain elements which are not favourably disposed towards reforms. Even the Congress Party is no exception to this statement,' he noted. When questioned him about the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by Prof Balasubramanyam, Dr Singh’s reply is relevant and significant till date: 'As Finance Minister I put a halt to the automatic route through which the Reserve Bank was to fund the Government. I do believe that because of the close linkages between fiscal and monetary policies, we need a high degree of coordination between monetary and fiscal policies. I gave a lot of weight to the advice of the RBI Governor. But I do not believe that the Reserve Bank can be totally independent. To a large extent the autonomy of the Bank is a state of mind. It very much depends on the vision, knowledge and experience of the Governor of the Bank. If the advice is of high quality, it cannot be ignored by any government. But I do not believe that we can legislate the autonomy of RBI.' He explained, 'We are not in that position and when people talk of independence, they are all talking of economies where factor mobility is very high, where a large number of policy instruments are available, where frictions and rigidities in economic structures and operation of the economy are low. Here we are operating relatively rudimentary structures with a lot of rigidity built into the system. We do not know the lags between policy implementation and its impact. So, I believe that RBI must have as much autonomy as possible in the sense that it must be free to give advice and if the government does not accept the advice, it should be known to the public why that advice was not accepted. But to say that the Central Bank can operate in isolation of the overall economic environment, unmindful of other objectives of economic policy, is not possible.' Not just a Bharat Ratna, the towering gateway of the Reserve Bank of India building on New Delhi’s Parliament Street needs renaming as ‘Dr Manmohan Singh Dwaar’ (or Gateway) where his words may be inscribed on stone.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LAaIfTt6XUj0	2025-02-19T16:16:57-08:00	
Putin Praises US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia As ‘First Step’ To ...	Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump could meet as early as this month, although a face-to-face meeting will take time to prepare, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, according to Russian news agencies. Peskov said the US-Russia talks held on Tuesday in Riyadh were a 'very, very important step' toward reaching a settlement on the Ukraine war, nearing its third year. 'In order to carry out, figuratively speaking, resuscitation measures, diplomats will now begin to work in light of the agreement (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov reached yesterday with (US Secretary of State Marco) Rubio,' Peskov was quoted by state media as saying. 'But this is the first step...Naturally, it’s impossible to fix everything in one day or a week. There is a long way to go,' he added. The talks in Riyadh were the first time US and Russian officials met to discuss ways to halt the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two. No Ukrainian or European officials were invited. Kyiv has said it will not accept any deal imposed without its consent. Putin thanked the Saudi leadership, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for creating a good atmosphere for holding the talks. The Russian president said he rated the bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia 'highly,' describing them as a 'first step' to restoring relations with Washington. 'In my opinion, we made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests,' he told journalists while visiting a drone manufacturing plant in his native Saint Petersburg. He added that Russia and the US needed to 'trust' each other if talks were to be successful. 'It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LGTOWeedvPHp	2025-02-19T16:14:06-08:00	
Peace In Europe Is Only Possible Under Trump – OpEd	After depending on America as its ally for decades, the European leaders at the Munich Security Conference this week now see first hand the continent's decades old norms and dogma of the American security umbrella now crumbling in front of them. The U.S. and Russia have begun talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at improving diplomatic ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, without the involvement of Europe and Ukraine. This is only made possible under Trump, and will signal a new path towards peace. If Biden defeated Trump in the elections, this conflict will only prolong with greater amounts of lives lost and money pumped in unnecessarily. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sat down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh, signaling a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations after years of tension following the Ukraine conflict, and after years of limited engagement thanks to Biden's old school approach. Trump criticised Zelensky for his disapproval of this direct meeting without Ukraine, and Trump is right when he argued that Zelensky has for three years been here but practically the war has seen no signs of abating. Only Trump has the capacity in the world now to halt this previous stalemate of the West's stubborn old school approach, and to end the war now. This first formal talk will set up nicely the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin, which will mark a new chapter of ties between Moscow and Washington, where it will no longer be constrained by past status quo and conventional approaches of the Biden administration. This meeting is very much overdue, and this will pave the way for the end of the Ukraine conflict, and this also brings much certainty to long term bilateral ties and a reset of relationship with Russia, away from the past entanglements of traditional European factor and trap. Since the conflict started, America has been confined to two principles: that Ukraine's future should not be decided without the involvement of Ukraine; and that America and its Western allies must come together to face Putin. ⁠ In came Trump and this changed entirely. European leaders now face a scramble to reorient their security setting amidst the new shake-up and the risks of an American pullout or using that as a pretext to force Europe to ease on its conventional barriers to Ukraine peace talks. European leaders held an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday to align their position after they are left out of the talks for Ukraine. The outcome of the eventual Trump-Putin meeting also will transcend the impact on Ukraine alone, as a new set of improved ties with the US will lessen the necessity for Moscow to increase reliance on China and the DPRK as a trade off for higher bargaining chips with the US. Without external influences and forces and with Trump's new distinct mantra of self push for peace, with the doubling down on the reality that Zelensky will not be naively expecting the same territorial ownership before the war, and in shutting down any idea of Ukraine joining NATO, this meeting will mark a new beginning in long term peace deals for Russia. Europe will also now be left with a more self independent defence approach without the easy reliance on American power presence, which will further limit its potential for escalations or provocations with Russia. With Trump's warning that Europe will be left alone, the talks of the creation of the Army of Europe will not in any way embolden European powers to challenge Russia, knowing how without the US involvement, it is in no way able to sustain any aggressive confrontation. This direct meeting between Trump and Putin is the most beneficial and strategic in any ways, in keeping away the European forces that have for long been a main barrier. With Trump's own tariff strategy and reorientation of security ties with Europe, plus the new thaw of ties between Russia and the US, Europe will be forced to scale down on its Russian pushback, seeing how fragile cross Atlantic ties will further limit its trade and economic options, which it will now have to rely more on the Indo Pacific and China as a result, although both are still risky for Europe's shaky Indo Pacific push. Can Europe defend itself without American support? Not a chance. This will force Europe to spend more on its defence, including its NATO commitment. This will require a spike in defence spending and especially on targeted key defence areas and deterrence capacity, something which Europe lacks now with its stagnating economy coupled with the tariff threat from Trump. Last year, only 18 NATO allies just spent the target of 2% of GDP in defence. What Europe really lacks is the proper defence and deterrence capacity against Russia, and will be left as sitting ducks without the holistic American military deterrent capacity especially in nuclear and high technology missiles. What does Europe really lack? It is the basic military technology and capability that make armed forces credible, capable and most importantly, lethal. Europe has outdated and outnumbered ships and missiles. It has ships without the proper missiles, planes without the needed technological capacity including jamming capabilities, and even troops without adequate ammunition. The disparity of Western and Eastern European military capabilities and intra Europe power gap are glaring, and lacking the combined holistic military spectrum including intelligence, space security and satellite capabilities, cyber and digital warfare, and missiles and nuclear first and second strike capacities, Europe cannot afford to defend itself without America. But it has for decades been piggybacking on America's back, banking on the conventional and assured American military and financial support in securing its interests and security needs without the urgent need to bolster these capabilities. The nature of European arsenals cannot match with the overall nuclear and military umbrella that America provides. The American nuclear umbrella and nuclear forces have protected Europe for decades, serving as the ultimate assurance and guarantee against a Russian invasion. This easy ride on security assurances for Europe made it easier for it to focus deeper on its economic and trade needs, and pivoting to Africa and Asia. However, even this is ineffective, with its Global Gateway strategy and the Indo Pacific push all failed to pull Europe out of its stagnation,even in post Brexit recovery. With Trump now reversing decades of free ride, European security suddenly looks in shambles, even without the Ukraine pretext in the first place. Compare that to Russia, who enjoys higher volume advantage both in conventional and nuclear capacities. France and Britain both have a combined nuclear warheads of around 500, while the US has around 5000, and Russia has the highest number at approximately 6000. The Ukrainian experience portrayed how the conflict there should not have been started in the first place, and if Trump was in power at that time, in his own words and Putin's, this would not have started. Trump has chastised the decision for Ukraine to take the fight with Russia, despite knowing the huge and glaring disparity of firepower and military capacity between Moscow and Kiev, while hoping for Washington to continue to provide military aid in the hundreds of billions, all while Europe is happy to just contribute enough, albeit little. Trump's further tariff threat on Europe should it continue hijack Trump's direct Putin deal remains a strategic and brilliant pull off from Trump, and open are the doors to new economic, trade and security reorientation with Russia in a gradually positive tone, especially if new future sanctions are withheld or waived in tandem with Russia's own reciprocal sweetener in the Ukraine peace deal. This new shake-up in the European security sphere where it is now finding itself suddenly exposed and vulnerable will mean that it is left with no choice but to placate Trump, and to avoid further tariff and risks of entire pullout of US security. This will push Europe to accept that the Ukrainian peace deal will need to go through, and there will be no more barriers to continue the financial wastages on the war and the ever mounting toll of lives lost on both sides. Europe has always singled out Russia as the main threat to its security, and yet before Trump 1.0, has continued to rely heavily on Russian oil and gas for its energy security, while soliciting American military and nuclear support at the same time. It will take Europe at least ten years to properly defend itself without America, and it will need America more than ever. In future thaw of ties and the upcoming negotiations, Russia is expected to demand for more considerations from the West, including possible prisoner swap and also the ease of sanctions on Iran which will allow for more Iranian oil export that will ease oil prices, and eventually help with Russia's post recovery. The West in turn is expected to push Russia to be disassociate more with China and North Korea, and to lower its role in BRICS and other anti-West mechanisms, barring the potentiality of Trump to further lavish higher tariff and sanctions on Moscow and also the risks of a fallout in the peace talks. However, both have more to gain from an eventual peace and a thaw in ties, and even Europe will reap more benefits in the future. The peace plan might also include the resumption of greater energy flow into Europe from Russia, which it needs.Most gas deliveries ceased in 2022, when Russia closed down Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The EU now receives just 10% of its gas from Russia, down from 45% in 2021. This affected Moscow's supply chain as well, and a heavy financial toll. Europe is feeling the pinch from continuing high prices, and this year it will need to buy more than usual to fill its storage which is now only 48% full compared to 66% at the same time last year. The limit on the supply and flow by Russia also affected both sides, in both navigating through this barrier while others tried to circumvent it. Hungary and Slovakia still receive piped Russian flows from Turkey; while others also get regasified Russian LNG that flows through northern Europe. Ukraine is adamant it will not renew its deal with Russia, but turnarounds are being studied. The EU'S most Russia-wary members would strongly oppose greater dependence on the country's energy, but that hinges on the outcome of the peace deal. At the same time, Trump would have wanted Europe to buy more of American oil and gas, but if the peace deal goes through, Russia will be able to supply more, which will lower prices around the world that might put American oil drillers and capacities at a disadvantage.However, the peace plan is more pressing, and will bring greater financial and security savings for Washington and Brussels. It is time to stop this madness of the Ukraine war, with the common sense and sensible approach taken by Trump to begin talks and negotiations, which will benefit all nations. Like what Trump has long argued, this should not have started in the first place, and would not have started should he still be in power, a fact where even Putin concurred, but at least Trump has now kept his promise to end this, cleaning up Biden's mess. Hopes are high for the return of peace at long last.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwXM1X-0KuOaN	2025-02-18T18:40:39-08:00	
Fighting Continues In Ethiopia’s Amhara Region – Analysis	Clashes are ongoing in Ethiopia’s Amhara region, where an ethnically based militia known as the Fano is battling the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) for control. In January, fighting broke out in Debre Birhan, a town 120 kilometers north of the capital, Addis Ababa. Fano militants used conventional and ambush attacks against government forces, the website Borkena reported. Fighting also was reported in the towns of Wollo, Gojjam and Gondar. 'The conflict continues to escalate, with widespread violence and heavy clashes across the Amhara region and parts of Oromia,' Hone Mandefro, of the Amhara Association of America, and Henok Ashagray, of the Centre for Human Rights at the University of Pretoria, wrote in an article for Inter Press Service. 'Government forces have intensified their military campaigns and are now using airstrikes and drones, while Fano militias resist fiercely. The fighting is severe and prolonged, with territorial control frequently shifting.' The violence comes after the ENDF launched a major military operation in October 2024 to defeat the Fano. But observers believe the Fano still control as much as 80% of the region. The militia operates mostly outside large population centers and has only briefly controlled major towns or roads. The fighting affects nearly every aspect of life in the Amhara region, disrupting farming and trade, shutting down health clinics, and raising the risk of famine. More than 4.1 million children are out of school, and more than 4,000 schools are closed, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Analysts believe that despite the heavy toll, the Fano continue to enjoy widespread public support, particularly in rural areas. 'Local communities appear to be closely collaborating with the groups,' the Rift Valley Institute said in a 2024 analysis. 'This seems to include information sharing, logistical support, and the provision of safe havens. The structure of the Fano, which mostly involves small groups operating in or near their home areas, means that they are able to rely on close ties with local communities.' The Fano formed in 2016 as a protest movement and later became an armed group claiming to protect Amhara land rights and other interests. During the 2020 to 2022 war in the Tigray region, the Fano fought alongside federal government forces and reclaimed a disputed area known as Western Tigray. The Fano, as well as government and Tigrayan forces, were accused of widespread war crimes, including brutal attacks against civilians. Near the end of the conflict, the ENDF began disarming and arresting Fano fighters, and, in 2023, the Fano launched an insurgency. Amid the prolonged insurgency, there is some positive news. In the seven weeks ending on January 31, there was a 44% decrease in fighting in the Amhara region compared to the previous seven weeks, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) Ethiopia Peace Observatory project. ACLED analysts believe this decrease was due to a lull during the holidays and the fact that an estimated 4,000 Fano fighters surrendered. They also credit peace talks initiated by diplomats from the African Union, European Union, United States and others. However, the fragmented nature of the Fano makes it difficult to hold discussions with all parties to the conflict. There are at least nine Fano groups, including some that are feuding with each other. 'The two conflicting parties face a long road to sitting at the negotiation table, particularly due to a lack of unity among Fano militias,' according to a 2024 ACLED report. 'One-to-one peace talks with each militia would complicate negotiations and offer less guarantee of establishing and sustaining peace in the region. Additionally, without a unified Fano to join peace talks, the government’s efforts to end the conflict have come up short.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwZLVSL1FOAHP	2025-02-18T17:37:36-08:00	
Iatrogenic Influence In Information Operations: Lessons From The ...	By Daniel Eerhart Introduction (FPRI) -- In medicine, iatrogenesis is when a physician’s medical treatment or procedures unintentionally induce disease, harmful complications, or any other ill effect. This paper introduces the concept of iatrogenic influence. It parallels the medical term and refers to situations where information operations inadvertently produce adverse outcomes and unintentionally exacerbate the issue they aim to improve. While this phenomenon has existed as long as information warfare has, the nearly twenty years of conflict following September 11th, 2001, known as the Global War on Terror (GWOT), has produced numerous missteps and infringements from which we can learn lessons to improve future efforts. During the GWOT, U.S. military psychological operations units deliberately integrated various information-related capabilities and aimed to wage a mutually supportive war in the tactical and cognitive domains. However, inherent to the nature of terrorist organizations is the ability to weaponize fear and win information battles. Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State, the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, and the Lashkar-e-Taiba all weaponized the information environment to bolster recruiting efforts and spread propaganda. While U.S. forces aiming to compete in the information environment had to wrestle with bureaucratic processes and protect domestic trust and perceived legitimacy in the combat zones, GWOT adversaries pressed their advantage in the information space through decentralized execution and rapid dissemination. U.S. military commands do not have the luxury of cutting corners; when they do, they increase the risk of iatrogenic influence. Inoculation theory suggests that exposure to a weak argument increases resistance to its persuasive abilities. Therefore, attempting to match adversary performance measures is an exercise in futility and may lend itself to further adversary advantage. U.S. influence systems are best suited for 'central route focus,' as described by the elaboration likelihood model, which provides detailed, well-reasoned arguments designed to engage audiences cognitively. In rapidly changing environments, emotional responses are more influential for short-term gains. However, the GWOT was fought for nearly twenty years, not a short period in any model. This paper contends that iatrogenic influence in information operations poses a significant risk to the U.S. military’s ability to achieve strategic objectives. By analyzing case studies, indicators of iatrogenic influence are identified, providing operational leaders an opportunity to assess their presence within operations. This enables pre-execution modifications, reducing risks in future influence activities. Iatrogenic Influence Since September 11, 2001, information operations and irregular warfare have played a significant role in the GWOT. With the rise of ubiquitous social media and a readily available information environment in the pockets of every target audience, adversaries seized the initiative and adapted. As U.S. military and allied forces aimed to compete in the information environment, numerous campaigns yielded unintentional negative consequences, exacerbating the issues they sought to mitigate. This phenomenon, designated as 'iatrogenic influence,' parallels the medical term of iatrogenesis, where interventions cause harm rather than heal. The risk of iatrogenic influence grows as modern conflict evolves to integrate information strategies and apply hybrid warfare methods. Contemporary conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza demonstrate the necessity to understand the information environment and effectively deliver the influence message. Without understanding how iatrogenic influence occurs, forces operating in the information environment will likely succumb to similar outcomes in future operations. Understanding Iatrogenic Influence in the Context of the GWOT This section explores the literature on information operations during the conflict, ethical frameworks during information operations, and counterinsurgency doctrine to contextualize the concept of iatrogenic influence. It will examine how coalition forces approached information operations during the GWOT and explains how those operations were nested underneath the overarching counterinsurgency strategy. Then it will concentrate on the role of the U.S. doctrine and establishing an international coalition by invoking Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Information Operations During Conflict In their book Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt argue that conflict has transitioned from hierarchical frameworks to decentralized networks. During the GWOT, this concept came to fruition in 2001 following the overthrow of al-Qaeda, the Taliban’s surrender, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 to establish the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. In 2003, the coalition used traditional military forces to defeat the Baath Party and overthrow Sadaam Hussein, but the conflict degraded to network warfare afterward. With traditional military hierarchies dominating ground conflict in the initial stages, adversaries transitioned to types of warfare that favored their strengths. A decentralized asymmetric form of warfare emerged that relied upon networks and information rather than battalions and brigades. Adversaries who were embedded in the population had the cultural understanding of the populace and an idiomatic understanding of the language to generate propaganda that resonated with their audiences. Unlike our adversaries, without established networks to spread messages through word of mouth, U.S. and allied psychological operations forces often relied upon loudspeakers and leaflets to communicate their messages. Conventional military forces were unable to effectively compete with the speed and efficiency of decentralized, culturally fluent networks. Dorothy Denning’s book Information Warfare and Security emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity and understanding the local context when performing information operations. However, despite having this academic understanding, the U.S. and allied ability to perform such activities on the ground was limited by the dissemination platforms, lack of availability of trans-cultural experts, and operational tempo. Counterinsurgency Doctrine In 2006, Gen. David Petraeus, USA, and Lt. Gen. James Amos, USMC, published Field Manual 3-24, the U.S. military’s first field manual on counterinsurgency. The manual’s 2014 rewritten version still defines the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. The authors address information management by stating, 'To limit discontent and build support, the affected government and any counterinsurgency forces assisting it create and maintain a realistic set of expectations among the population, friendly military forces, and the international community.' This statement is a critical indicator of whether the information operations will devolve into iatrogenesis. If creating realistic expectations is critical to building support and legitimacy, then inherently, any information operation that is revealed to be deceptive, that exaggerates expectations, or that disconnects perception will result in adverse results. Field Manual 3-24 provides insight into cultures and reminds the reader that they should not assume foreign audiences will share the same values or perspectives as U.S. personnel. Even within audiences, contradictions and variations of behaviors and beliefs will impact the message’s ability to resonate. The key is to balance the requirements within the goal of the operation and the cultural beliefs within the area of operations. In statistics, variance increases when data points become more spread out from the mean of the dataset. This concept parallels information operations, where the influence actors perform a target audience analysis on the 'mean' of their dataset (i.e., the average member of their target audience). The farther their effort spreads from the average member, the more likely they will violate a cultural belief, creating discontent as described in Field Manual 3-24. Transparent and truthful information with a precise target audience ensures effective information operations during counterinsurgency. Case Studies The following three case studies provide concrete examples of iatrogenic influence during the Global War on Terror and build upon the theoretical and doctrinal background as a baseline. Examining these case studies provides insights into the areas where missteps unfolded and created tensions. Guantanamo Detainee Photos (2002) On January 11, 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense released a photo of twenty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay on their knees. The shackled prisoners were in orange jumpsuits with masks over their heads and were surrounded by razor wire. The photo was not a leak; the Department of Defense deliberately released it as part of an assignment to photograph the opening day of Camp X-Ray in southeastern Cuba. The photo has been broadcast throughout the world and used by news agencies as evidence of U.S. wrongdoing and torture during the war on terror. Even twenty years later, the photo frequently reappears alongside stories calling for transparency in military detainee operations. Rather than the international community viewing the photo as anonymous prisoners detained within the guidelines of the Geneva Convention, the photo brought about criticism regarding the willingness to subject prisoners to sensory deprivation and degradation. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State both have used the photoas part of their propaganda efforts and recruitment messaging. The release’s original intent, to build trust in U.S. transparency, only led to further questions about prisoner treatment away from camera view. Iatrogenic influence indicators are again apparent in this case study, where a Western lens categorized the capture and distribution. Broad general audience photo dissemination occurred with inconsistent messaging. If the goal is to communicate that prisoners receive treatment with dignity and respect, then a display of hooded individuals on their knees surrounded by razor wire is incompatible with that goal. Furthermore, with a broad audience, there was no feedback mechanism from the target audience because the dissemination needed more specificity. Afghanistan Soccer Ball Incident (2007) In August 2007, protests occurred in Afghanistan after the U.S. military dropped soccer balls from a helicopter in Khost province. The soccer balls displayed flags from around the world, including Saudi Arabia, whose flag features the Islamic declaration of faith, the Shahada. For Muslims, the name of Allah is revered, and placing a verse from the Quran on a ball intended to be kicked by feet was a significant insult. The operation aimed to promote cooperation while engaging with Afghan youth and building unity to counteract insurgent influence. However, the cultural insensitivity of displaying a religious text on an item associated with the foot resulted in backlash and further exacerbated tensions, undermining the operational objectives. Furthermore, the incident allowed insurgents to exploit the misstep and message anti-coalition sentiment. The indicators of potential iatrogenic influence were present and likely evident before mission execution. First, there was a significant inconsistency between the delivery mechanism and the desired effect. Building rapport and cooperation occurs not by dropping objects out of a helicopter but through face-to-face communication. If the U.S. servicemembers had chosen to distribute the balls in person, they would have had an immediate cultural feedback mechanism. The first individual to respond angrily to receiving a ball with a Saudi flag would have been a clear signal of the messaging error and would have mitigated the backlash. If historical mistrust existed between the Afghans and coalition members in that region, it would have required consistent and persistent messaging rather than a solitary product to build trust. White Dog Leaflets (2017) In 2017, U.S. forces dropped leaflets in parts of Parwan province, Afghanistan, that depicted the image of a lion chasing a white dog with the Shahada printed on it. The operation intended to use the white dog to represent the Taliban flag, which is white with the Shahada. However, the printing of the Muslim profession of faith on an animal that many Muslims view as unclean was deemed deeply offensive and severely eroded local trust in coalition forces. Maj. Gen. James Linder, then the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, was forced to make a statement and apologize for the leaflets. Later, a Taliban suicide bomber detonated outside an American base, wounding four civilians, with the Taliban claiming it was retaliation for the leaflet. The use of religious content drastically increases the likelihood of iatrogenic influence by potentially oversimplifying the content or disseminating it through a false lens. The Taliban did not accidentally stumble upon the decision to have the white flag with the Shahada as their rallying symbol; it was a deliberate decision with ramifications in the information environment, and the U.S. military’s decision to oversimplify their assumptions about the Taliban resulted in severe consequences. The leaflets intended to inspire the local population to report the activities of Taliban members to coalition forces for elimination; however, because of iatrogenic influence, the credibility of U.S. forces was decreased instead. The leaflets needed to show evidence of a precise target audience, and there existed a disconnect between the delivery mechanism and the intended message. Since villages would have to find coalition members to communicate Taliban locations, disseminating this message through a leaflet does not make sense. With limited feedback mechanisms, this operation may have attempted to demonstrate performance measures within U.S. military hierarchies, which raise concerns about ethics. Analysis and Lessons Learned When examining instances where information operations in the GWOT had an iatrogenic effect, certain consistencies occur. By reviewing the publicly available case studies and through retrospective examination of a broader context, a trend arises of critical indicators that may signal an increased risk of iatrogenic influence. Table 1 summarizes the key indicators: Table 1: Iatrogenic Influence Indicators IndicatorDescriptionRiskBroad General AudienceThe operation targets a broad, general audience rather than a specific group, which makes performing target audience analysis difficult.The messages may be misrepresented or misinterpreted, resulting in rejection, resentment, confusion, or opposition.Inconsistent DeliveryMechanismThe dissemination method is inconsistent with the desired behavior or outcome.The target audience may question the nature of the messages and perceive them as superficial.False Cultural LensThe operation’s disseminators view products through their own cultural lens rather than the target audience’s perspective.Messages may inadvertently provoke backlash or negative emotions for violating the target audience’s cultural norms, beliefs, or values.Inconsistent Messaging/Information FratricideInconsistent or contradictory messaging among various stakeholders that is supposed to be mutually supportive.Undermines credibility and leads to skepticism or confusion about messaging and the messengers.Historical MistrustThe target audience has a history of mistrust or negative perceptions toward the source.Messages are more likely to be dismissed or viewed skeptically, exacerbating existing tensions.Deceptive TacticsThe campaign relies on deception, disinformation, or manipulation.Loss of credibility and trust if deception is uncovered; adversaries can exploit to discredit the campaign.Ethical and Moral ConcernsTactics or messages raise ethical or moral concerns.It provokes outrage and condemnation, undermining the operation’s legitimacy and enabling adversary propaganda.Insufficient FeedbackMechanismsThere are no mechanisms to gather and respond to feedback from the target audience.Adverse reactions may go unnoticed and unaddressed, allowing iatrogenic influence to grow.Oversimplification of IssuesCampaign oversimplifies complex issues.They are perceived as superficial or patronizing, failing to resonate and potentially reinforcing adversary narratives.Dynamic and RapidlyChanging EnvironmentThe environment is dynamic and rapidly changing.Messages can become outdated or irrelevant, perceived as incompetent or detached from current realities. Lesson Learned: As the Target Audience Size Increases, So Does the Risk In the three cases examined in this paper, the target audience was general and non-specific. When performing information operations, the smaller the target audience, the better the ability to perform target audience analysis and ensure the message is well received. As the target audience grows, so does the risk of iatrogenic influence. When disseminating messages to a large general audience, limitations on the options for delivery mechanism exacerbate the potential for a cascading series of uncontrollable responses. While face-to-face communication is slow and constricts an operation’s ability to have an extensive reach, Internet-based operations that involve the public release of photos have few decision points where commanders can correct the course of events. In the case of soccer balls in Afghanistan, dropping objects from a helicopter enables rapid dissemination. Still, it limits the ability to recover products following violating iatrogenic influence indicators. In future operations, commanders should limit general audience distribution and concentrate on targeted influence operations that limit risk while simultaneously increasing the likelihood of the message resonating. Lesson Learned: The Messenger Matters In each case study, official Department of Defense communication channels delivered the messages as an official release or from a military helicopter. The difficulty of information delivery occurs when the target audience realizes they do not identify with the messengers, increasing the barriers to resonation within the target audience. The special operations community made this realization in 2010, deciding to integrate all-female cultural support teams into special operations missions. Unsurprisingly, special operations soldiers conducting combat missions were having difficulty communicating with women and children and building trust among the local populace. As a result, the U.S. Special Operations Command issued a tasking order specifying five critical cultural support team tasks, including supporting information operations messaging to the female population and minimizing civilian interference with military operations. Commanders lauded the cultural support team concept as a resounding success and demonstrated that the messenger is at least as important as the message in all aspects of information operations. In future operations, commanders must strive to have the messenger meet all the traits of their target audience, just as Radio Sahar, the all-female Afghan radio station, did. It is important to emphasize that selecting a reflective messenger is not an action of deception; the messenger must remain truthful about their message and transparent about its attribution. Instead, it is simply an effort to allow the message to be heard among the target audience and given a chance to resonate. Lesson Learned: Legitimacy Before Influence In each case study, coalition forces attempted to utilize legitimacy shortcuts to influence their audiences. In the case of the white dog leaflets, U.S. servicemembers desired an increase in reports of Taliban locations. However, civilians need someone to report to—a person, or at least a method of communication they trust would not be used by malicious actors to punish people making reports. Likewise, in the soccer ball and Guantanamo prisoner case studies, the activities demonstrated a coalition self-perceived sense of superiority. In contrast, events like the 2006–7 Anbar Awakening demonstrate the effectiveness of establishing legitimacy before attempting influence. When Col. Sean MacFarland and 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division, arrived in al Anbar province, Ramadi was one of the most dangerous cities in Iraq, with more than three times more attacks per capita than any other area. Colonel MacFarland led the brigade in engaging directlywith tribal leaders, respecting their culture, and addressing the root causes of the population’s grievances. Once it established legitimacy, the brigade used a face-to-face dissemination mechanism consistent with its message. Through town halls, tribal councils, and direct communication, the soldiers built popular support. They worked with Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha to unite the tribes against al-Qaeda and stabilize the region. Conclusion The twenty-year GWOT provides numerous case studies to examine missteps in the information environment and recognize missed opportunities. Iatrogenic influence occurs where the consequences of information operations efforts are harmful and counterproductive. While this article used case studies of iatrogenic influence to identify indicators of high-risk operations, examining successful case studies will improve organizational success by recognizing when iatrogenic influence is appropriately mitigated. In the modern era, where adversaries rapidly aggregate influence capabilities, U.S. forces must recognize the lessons of iatrogenic influence. Contemporary conflicts are increasingly occurring in the cognitive domain, further demonstrating the necessity of U.S. civilian and military organizations to have cultural literacy when working in the information environment. Learning lessons from past GWOT operations and recognizing the possibility of iatrogenic influence will go a long way in America’s ability to use influence activities to our advantage in the future.

Outrage At Munich – Analysis	By Amrita Narlikar Following the World Economic Forum that convenes at Davos, another jamboree takes place in Munich. There is usually a fair overlap of key protagonists in the two settings, plus an additional, safe familiarity of reliable faces that have been invitees for years (and sometimes, decades) in the respective forum. For all the resources guzzled in organising these events and the media coverage surrounding them, they tend to be tame affairs involving men and women in expensive suits who speak politely of reforming the system and then return home to business as usual. So the speech by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on 14 February at the Munich Security Conference has shaken many of the global elite to the core. The anger is undisguised, especially among the Europeans. The German Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, described Vance’s critique as 'not acceptable'. For the European Foreign Policy Chief, Kaja Kallas, the speech sounded as if '… they try to pick a fight with us…'. The German Chancellor pushed back firmly and said that neither Germany nor Europe would accept outside interference, especially not from friends and allies. Social media platforms are alight with indignation against Vance. Why has the speech ruffled so many feathers? First, Vance, delivering his speech with aplomb, had the temerity to articulate a view that few dare to voice publicly: democratic backsliding (not in the Global South, as is common practice for Western actors to bemoan), but in Europe’s heartland. While Europe’s political establishment is unreserved in criticising the state of democracy, pluralism, and liberalism in the rest of the world, it resents being at the receiving end of similar scrutiny and commentary. Second, Vance went a step further: he framed his speech in terms of shared Transatlantic values. There is legitimate concern that Trump’s transactionalism may result in a sidelining of global norms; that his Vice President embraces the language of values should have been welcomed with open arms. But 'normative power Europe' seems to think it is the sole proprietor and representative of values. Third, Vance made only one passing reference to Russia and Ukraine in his speech in the context of reaching a 'reasonable settlement' between the two, and urged Europe 'to step up in a big way to provide for its own defence'. While many European leaders acknowledged the importance of burden-sharing as part of their NATO membership, the MSC audience at large seemed shocked and disappointed that Vance’s speech had incorporated such a cursory reference to the war on Europe’s borders. These are typical European double standards at work, already called out by the Indian Minister for External Affairs, Dr S. Jaishankar in 2023: Europe has the mindset that its 'problems are the world’s problem, but the world’s problem are not Europe’s problem.' Now that we finally have an administration that wants to ensure a division of labour between Europe and the US, with the latter focusing on the China challenge in the Indo-Pacific, Europe finds itself in a deeply uncomfortable position. Finally, Vance poked a hornet’s nest by referring to the challenges of 'mass migration' in Europe and made himself an easy target for the moral outrage of self-righteous, self-styled liberals. His speech could have certainly done with more nuance on this question of existential importance to many—including the emigrants who endure great dangers in the hope of reaching countries of safety and opportunity and then end up facing xenophobia and worse. But a much more serious discussion is needed on both legal and illegal immigration in Europe. Simply pretending that the problem does not exist and demonising Vance for his critique helps no one. Vance’s comments on the fragilities of European democracy hit too close to home. The great and the good of Europe seem to resent Vance’s 'physician, heal thyself' approach, doubly so perhaps because it makes it difficult for a governing elite to deflect attention away from serious domestic problems. Viewed from outside Europe, Vance’s speech offered some refreshing perspectives. Instead of a Transatlantic club of mutual admiration, with the rest of the world excluded from the party, something more interesting could be in the offing. This is not a US that is trying to destroy Europe or NATO (contra what some of the social media frenzy has suggested), but a mature power that recognises both the worth and the limitations of the Transatlantic partnership. If the EU opens up to some self-reflection, which it often demands from the Global South, it could build a more honest and lasting Transatlantic alliance that also welcomes other like-minded partners (including India). Vance’s speech told us something reassuring about America’s continued attachment to values. This will be one of several reasons why the US is likely to want to deepen its relationship with the world’s largest democracy. But the speech, and the reaction it generated, also ended up revealing a great deal about Europe’s political landscape. Vance, through his MSC speech, held up a mirror to Europe. The indignation exploding in Europe and beyond is simply the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in the glass.

Indonesia’s Probable Foreign Policy Shift From The West Under A P...	By Melinda Martinus The inauguration of Prabowo Subianto as Indonesia’s president and the appointment of Sugiono, a former military officer, as foreign minister mark a potential recalibration of Indonesia’s foreign diplomacy. This transition is expected to modify the foreign policy framework established during Joko Widodo’s decade-long presidency, which sought to serve domestic economic objectives over projecting regional or global leadership.[1] The new administration is anticipated to adopt a more assertive international stance, influenced by Prabowo’s personal experiences,[2] rapidly evolving geopolitical dynamics, Indonesia’s rising economic prominence, and a growing consensus among Jakarta’s policymakers on the need for a more proactive global diplomatic role.[3] While the country may project stronger global leadership, Prabowo’s presidency is likely to gradually shift Indonesia’s alignment further away from Western alliances—a trend that had already gained traction among Jakarta’s foreign policy elites during Jokowi’s administration. Under Jokowi’s leadership, Indonesia developed closer economic ties with China, which has emerged as Indonesia’s major trade partner, and with Singapore, which is its largest provider of foreign direct investment (FDI). The previous administration also made some efforts at strengthening alliances within Asia, particularly through cooperation within ASEAN and with key economies like Japan and South Korea, including defence cooperation with Russia[4] and India.[5] Key drivers behind this shift include the need to bolster economic growth, reinforce the principle of non-alignment, and diversify international partnerships beyond traditional Western powers. A few weeks after his inauguration, Prabowo’s administration signalled a reinforcement in this foreign policy direction, notably by deciding to become a BRICS partner. His first overseas trip was to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping to discuss economic and security cooperation. A surprise came with the joint statement issued after the bilateral meeting, which included an agreement on joint development in areas of the South China Sea where Indonesia and China have overlapping claims. This marked a significant departure from Indonesia’s previous stance on the South China Sea. With this statement, Indonesia appears to be the first ASEAN member state to implicitly recognise Beijing’s nine-dash line.[6] This article seeks to further analyse four critical dimensions that influence Indonesia’s foreign policy pivot under the new administration, namely adapting to the US’ protectionism, managing the EU’s conditionality, advancing the Palestinian cause, and strengthening ASEAN resilience. The analysis provided in this article draws on insights from the multi-year data from the State of Southeast Asia surveys[7] conducted by the ASEAN Studies Centre of ISEAS –Yusof Ishak Institute to highlight emerging trends and anticipated shifts away from Western-led initiatives. Rather than making specific predictions, this article showcases long-term perception trends among Indonesia’s foreign policy elites through the use of data and evidence to elaborate on the changes in strategic alignments. ADAPTING TO US PROTECTIONISM Under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesia is likely to sustain its focus on natural resource-driven and infrastructure developmental policies to meet an 8 per cent annual growth target—an essential step to reach high-income status by 2045.[8] The 'downstreaming'[9] strategy initiated under Jokowi, which restricts exports of raw minerals like nickel and bauxite, aims to strengthen domestic industries and move Indonesia further up the value chain in electric vehicle (EV) battery production, something that has become a key economic policy. However, the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted in 2022 to bolster US industrial competitiveness, mandates domestic sourcing and assembly requirements, which many partners view as protectionist. The IRA’s tax credits for clean energy production, such as electric vehicles (EVs), favour materials sourced domestically or from countries with free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US. Since Indonesia lacks an FTA with the US, these policies effectively obstruct its ambition to integrate into the EV supply chain.[10] Additionally, the IRA restricts involvement from 'foreign entities of concern,' notably targeting Chinese entities, who are instrumental in providing capital investment for Indonesia’s battery sector. The current political environment might complicate Indonesia’s ability to negotiate mineral and battery exports to the US. Consequently, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led initiative aimed at strengthening regional economic cooperation, has received only lukewarm interest from Indonesia. Indonesia perceives that the IPEF falls short of meeting its economic needs, especially as US policies like the IRA undercut the framework’s goal of enhancing connectivity with Asian partners. This disconnect reinforces Indonesia’s doubts about the framework’s benefits, particularly in light of restrictive US trade requirements that clash with its economic priorities. More so, the IPEF, focused on trade, supply chain resilience, clean energy, and economic fairness, does not include tariff reductions, which limits its appeal as a trade-enhancing agreement that is needed by most US trading partners in Asia. According to the State of Southeast Asia survey, most Indonesian elite respondents initially expressed uncertainty about the IPEF’s benefits (see Chart 1). In 2023, 52.1 per cent were uncertain, while 34.7 per cent viewed it positively and 13.2 per cent negatively. However, by 2024, perceptions had shifted. Although the majority (41.9 per cent) of Indonesian respondents remained uncertain, the proportion of those with a negative view almost doubled to 25.7 per cent. Indonesia may perceive that joining the IPEF would not help to lift restrictions brought by the IRA. Under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesia is expected to remain wary of US protectionism, particularly following president-elect and now President Trump’s election and his pledge to increase tariffs on Asian imports. This concern is further heightened by the likelihood that his party will depart from Biden administration policies, downplaying the IPEF, and reducing focus on ASEAN engagement. This may prompt Indonesia to reduce its reliance on the US as an export market and to seek broader trade cooperation with less protectionist partners such as BRICS, which could offer alternatives to Western standards, and also with Asian countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. Additionally, Indonesia may deepen ties with the Gulf states, especially to generate new sources of FDI. Chart 1 Growing Pessimism on the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) The overall impact and effectiveness of the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) (according to Indonesian respondents), is likely to be: The State of Southeast Asia: 2024 Survey Report (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2024) MANAGING THE EU’S CONDITIONALITIES Amid rising US protectionism, Indonesia’s scepticism toward Western trade conditionalities is mirrored in its diminishing perceptions of the European Union (EU). As Indonesia’s fifth-largest trading partner and a major source of foreign direct investment,[11] the EU has traditionally been valued as an alternative partner for export market, particularly as global trade adapts to the intensifying US-China trade war and China’s domestic economic turbulence. However, Indonesia increasingly views EU regulatory stances, on standards such as sustainability, labour protection, and human rights, as restrictive. This adds challenges to the forging of functional relationships and tampers enthusiasm for deeper economic alignment. The EU’s efforts to assert global leadership in carbon reduction, as pledged in the Paris Agreement and operationalised through the EU Green Deal, has increasingly incorporated extraterritorial regulations affecting trade partners. Policies like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) require trade partners to meet elevated environmental standards. These have generated negative sentiments, with Jakarta viewing them as forms of economic coercion[12] that infringe on its sovereignty and development ambitions; this complicates relations between the EU and Indonesia broadly. The situation has further diminished perceptions of the EU among policymakers in Jakarta (See Chart 2). According to the State of Southeast Asia surveys, Indonesian respondents initially held favourable views of the EU’s role in promoting global free trade. In the 2021 survey, 29.5 per cent of respondents viewed the EU as a primary leader in this area, ahead of China (20.9 per cent), ASEAN (19.4 per cent), and the US (15.5 per cent). However, by 2024, perceptions had shifted dramatically, with only 8.3 per cent of Indonesian respondents regarding the EU as showing leadership, placing it in fourth place alongside the US. Chart 2. Confidence in the EU’s leadership in championing the global free trade agenda has been dwindling, 2021 versus 2024 Who do you have the most confidence in to champion the global free trade agenda? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) The State of Southeast Asia: 2021 and 2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021 and 2024) The Prabowo administration is likely to intensify Indonesia’s stance against EU trade conditions by promoting partnerships with countries imposing fewer constraints. In seeking alternative alliances, Prabowo aims to reinforce Indonesia’s economic sovereignty, advocating trade frameworks that support domestic industries free from restrictive external pressures.[13] This approach underscores Indonesia’s commitment to a global economic order that accommodates diverse development paths, thus protecting its own strategic interests amid shifting international dynamics. ADVANCING THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE Indonesia’s trust in the Western alliance has been strained due to the latter’s perceived partiality in the Israel-Gaza conflict and double standards. Western nations, including the US and EU members, often advocate for human rights, international law, and civilian protection, most recently when they were rallying support for Ukraine. However, in the Gaza context, Indonesians see the West’s support for Israel as blatant ignoring of the humanitarian crises faced by Palestinians; this fuels perceptions of selective enforcement by the West of international norms based on political interests rather than universal principles. This sentiment resonates deeply with Indonesian public opinion. According to the State of Southeast Asia 2024 Survey, about three-quarters (74.5 per cent) of Indonesian respondents viewed the Israel-Hamas conflict as the top geopolitical concern for their government while 77.7 per cent believed that Israel’s attack on Gaza had gone too far. Trust in Western alliances, particularly the US and EU, has trended downward among Indonesian respondents in the State of Southeast Asia Surveys over the past six years (see Chart 3). This decline was especially sharp for the EU in 2024, reaching an all-time low, largely due to the West’s stance on the Gaza conflict. Trust in the US was initially low in 2019–2020 under Trump’s leadership but improved under Biden’s administration, with the latter emphasising US re-engagement with Asia. However, the trust in the US has been tempering again over the past two years. This could be attributed to the US’ lack of concrete functional cooperation in Asia, and the worsening situation in Gaza. Chart 3. Declinig confidence in US and EU leadership How confident are you that the US and the EU (respectively) will do the right thing to contribute to global peace, prosperity, and governance? (This is according to Indonesian respondents who indicated confident and highly confident) The State of Southeast Asia: 2019-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) To complicate matters, amid ongoing US-China geopolitical tensions in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is often viewed as a country capable of maintaining a strategic balance. Since the 2020 survey introduced a question on ASEAN’s strategic preference between the US and China, Indonesian respondents have shown a consistent approach towards balancing the two powers. In 2020, by a slim margin at 52.0 per cent, Indonesians chose China over the US (which garnered 48.0 per cent) (see Chart 4). Between 2021 and 2022, most respondents had leaned toward the US. However, by 2023, preferences had shifted significantly, with 53.7 per cent favouring China compared to 46.3 per cent for the US. In 2024, the gap substantially widened, with 74.2 per cent favouring China and only 26.8 per cent choosing the US. This significant shift signals that the US’ stance on the Gaza conflict has undermined its reputation in Indonesia. Chart 4. Future of ASEAN amid China-US rivalry If ASEAN were forced to align itself with one of the strategic rivals, which should it choose? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) The State of Southeast Asia: 2020-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) REVIVING ASEAN-CENTRIC REGIONALISM Amid today’s global uncertainties, Indonesia must find a pathway to navigate the escalating geopolitical competition. Enhancing its leadership within ASEAN and reinforcing regionalism may provide a cushion in case of future conflicts. Consequently, Prabowo is likely to project a more proactive regional role. While Prabowo may insist that his administration must adhere to a 'free and active' foreign policy and maintain balanced ties with both the US and China, he is expected to adopt a more assertive stance within ASEAN, particularly on security and economic matters.[14] This strategy corroborates well with the views of foreign policy elites in Jakarta. According to The State of Southeast Asia surveys, Indonesians increasingly view ASEAN as an essential counterbalance to China’s dominant economic role in the region (see Chart 5). Although China continues to be regarded as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s confidence in ASEAN is gaining momentum. When the first survey was conducted in 2020, only 10.4 per cent of Indonesian respondents viewed ASEAN as the most influential economic force in the region; by 2024, this share had nearly tripled (28 per cent). Amid geoeconomic uncertainties, ASEAN has upheld its multilateral trade frameworks, most notably through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and continues to negotiate trade agreements and investment facilitation with major dialogue partners. This openness and commitment to multilateral systems have led Indonesians to place high hopes in ASEAN. Chart 5. China remains the most influential economic power, while confidence in ASEAN continues to rise In your view, which country/regional organisation is the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia? The State of Southeast Asia: 2019-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) A similar trend is observed in perceptions of global leadership. In the same surveys, respondents were asked which country or regional organisation they had the strongest confidence in to provide leadership in maintaining the rules-based order and upholding international law. Among Indonesian respondents, ASEAN has increasingly been seen as the leader in this regard over the past three years, surpassing the EU, which held that position in 2021 (see Chart 6). ASEAN has consistently advocated for a rules-based multilateral system, both regionally and globally. It has promoted dialogue, cooperation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes through frameworks such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the East Asia Summit (EAS). ASEAN also played a critical role in advocating the implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and the ongoing negotiations for a Code of Conduct (COC) to manage regional tensions. Although progress has been slow, ASEAN continues to emphasise the importance of international law in resolving conflicts. Chart 6. ASEAN increasingly seen as the leader in maintaining rules-based order and upholding international law Who do you have the most confidence in to provide leadership to maintain the rules-based order and uphold international law? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) Looking at this trend, Indonesia could advocate a stronger regional security architecture, and emphasise the defence of maritime sovereignty amid Chinese incursions. On the economic front, the Prabowo administration may focus on improving intra-regional trade, strengthening supply chains, and boosting investment within Southeast Asia. However, structural challenges within ASEAN, such as divergent interests and strategic misalignment among member states, will likely constrain progress toward a collective regional security framework. Despite these challenges, Indonesia is expected to remain committed to ASEAN centrality, and to use that as a platform to balance external powers and promote autonomy.[15] CONCLUSION In conclusion, Indonesia’s foreign policy under Prabowo Subianto is poised to mark a significant shift away from its traditional Western alliances, reflecting both changing domestic priorities and evolving geopolitical dynamics. The administration’s focus on economic growth, regional security, and international diplomacy is likely to reinforce Indonesia’s strategic autonomy, with particular emphasis being put on deepening ties within Asia and diversifying its partnerships. With the appointment of several former military personnel to his Cabinet, including as foreign minister, Indonesia is expected to adopt a more security-oriented lens in its economic policies and international diplomacy. Indonesia’s growing scepticism towards Western trade conditionalities, such as those imposed by the US and EU, will likely continue to influence its foreign policy direction; it is expected to seek alternatives to economic frameworks that are perceived as restrictive. At the same time, Indonesia’s commitment to ASEAN as a central platform for regional cooperation and leadership, particularly in upholding a rules-based order, reflects the nation’s desire to enhance its regional influence while navigating the complex US-China rivalry. As the Prabowo administration seeks to recalibrate Indonesia’s international posture, the evolving trends in regional and global leadership suggest that Indonesia’s foreign policy will increasingly be driven by a vision of economic sovereignty and multilateral engagement, with ASEAN and potentially BRICS playing a pivotal role in this transformation.

How China Is Weaponizing Its Dominance In Critical Minerals Trade...	By Keith Rockwell Export curbs applied to technology or critical raw materials are often justified by the need to promote downstream industries, the raising of revenue and environmental protection. But there are other motivations, including the desire to gain an upper hand on a geopolitical rival. Governments justify export restrictions as necessary for national security, an ill-defined concept often used to defend trade-distorting actions. During the 2007 food crisis, countries hoarded rice and maize. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments applied export bans on vaccines and medical diagnostic products. The war in Ukraine saw Russia restricting agricultural, mineral and energy exports. An average of more than 110 export restrictions were introduced each yearbetween 2021–23. China’s December 2024 ban on exports to the United States of critical raw materials was predictable, given their strategic value in the production of semiconductors, electric batteries and armaments. The number of restrictions on the export of critical raw materials applied by governments grew more than five-fold between 2009–20 to 13,102. But this move represents a dangerous step which will further damage US–China relations. Gallium is used in semiconductors, germanium in both semiconductors and infrared technologies, antimony in the production of everything from bullets to missiles, while graphite is critical for electric batteries. China dominates the world market in all of these materials, producing roughly 60 per cent of the world’s germanium, 80 per cent of global gallium production and 78 per cent of antimony. The perceived utility of export curbs was underscored when China replied to Donald Trump’s decision to hit Chinese goods with 10 per cent tariffs. In addition to its imposing import duties on automobiles and filing a dispute settlement case at the World Trade Organization, Beijing imposed another layer of export restrictions on 4 February, this time on materials used in the production of military, information technology and clean energy products. Beijing’s muscle flexing signals to Trump that it will respond aggressively to Washington’s cascade of trade restrictions. In the past, China’s actions have been a direct response to the cavalcade of technology sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies. In 2018, the Trump administration banned Huawei and ZTE telecommunications equipment for government use. US allies later adopted similar prohibitions. Under former president Joe Biden, the United States banned exports to China of advanced semiconductors, quantum computing equipment and lithography equipment, also barring Japanese and Dutch companies using US technology from exporting to China. Reciprocal sanctions have driven up costs for both US and Chinese tech companies and fuelled national security concerns. Washington’s fear of being shut out of supply chains led the Biden administration to completely rethink its approach. Sustainability and ‘friendshoring’ became the principal objectives. In 2006 and 2010, China imposed export restrictions on rare earth minerals that are important components in defence technologies, clean energy products, smartphones, digital cameras and computer hard disks. China is the dominant global producer of rare earths, mining 240,000 tonnes in 2023. Chinese reserves at the end of 2023 amounted to 44 million tonnes. By contrast, the United States — the second largest producer — extracted 43,000 tonnes and had reserves of 1.8 million tonnes. Alarmed at the prospect of being cut off from rare earth supplies, Washington, Brussels and Tokyo all brought cases against China to the World Trade Organization in 2012. The United States argued that the artificial shortage of these minerals constituted a national security threat. In 2014, dispute settlement panels ruled in their favour and the Chinese measures were withdrawn. Trade restrictions have been unsettling and costly, but have also inspired companies to adapt, either with alternative technologies or by exploring new sources of materials. Despite US sanctions, Chinese companies have shown surprising resilience. Cut off from imports of advanced chips, Huawei developed its own advanced semiconductor for its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. Barred from using technologies like Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android in the production of its smartphones, the company unveiled in August 2023 its own operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT. Price surges for scarce minerals — gallium has risen 212 per cent from its 2020 price of US$298.20 per kilogram — have also driven new entrants to the mining business, threatening China’s dominant position. This mirrors the rising global production of rare earth metals since 1995, jumping from 75.7 kilotons to more than 350 kilotons in 2023. It is impossible to predict whether Trump will ramp up sanctions against China or seek a deal for greater access to the vast Chinese market. He is a dealmaker, but has also pledged to levy tariffs as high as 60 per cent on all Chinese goods and has surrounded himself with China hawks who will encourage a hard line. Distrust of Beijing in Washington is deep and cuts across party lines. Many US commentators see China weakened by slowing economic growth, demographic challenges and few real allies. But it would be a mistake to take China lightly. The January announcement that Chinese tech company Deepseek has developed an artificial intelligence model at a fraction of the cost of Western companies is further proof of this. President Xi Jinping is determined to preserve and augment China’s greatness and has made clear that any future aggression will be dealt with promptly and formidably. Even before Trump’s decisive victory in November, the US–China relationship was volatile. As he retakes the White House, there is a real risk that relations will deteriorate further. Keeping a lid on trade tensions will be a tall order. About the author: Keith M Rockwell is Senior Research Fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and Global Fellow at the Wilson Center.

Elections Won’t Save Haiti – OpEd	By Caleb Mills In a recent interview with TV5 Monde, Haiti’s transitional council president Leslie Voltaire told a nation on the brink of collapse that tentative elections would be scheduled for mid-November. It’s been nearly a decade since the small island’s last democratic contest, and understandably so. The guardrails for democracy have all but collapsed in the years since, and in its place, anarchical gang warfare has swept across a broken state. It begs the question; can a country where half the inhabitants currently face starvation support an election? Is Haiti’s violent political climate right for a democratic transition? The situation on the ground is critical. In the two years since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, Haiti has crumbled under the weight of local competing gangs and warlords. By 2023, roughly 60% of the capital city, Port-au-Prince, was occupied by non-governmental factions, with violence openly tearing into the streets and bringing everyday life to a standstill. For many, like musician Jean Jean-Pierre, simply leaving the house was a dauntingly dangerous task. 'When you do go out you are so aware of everything – a car behind you, a motorcycle behind you. You never know if a vehicle just wants to pass you, or pass you and force you to stop for a kidnapping because it happens so often,' Jean-Pierre toldUSA Today in March 2023. The situation has not improved almost two years after he made that statement. As a result, mass displacement of local residents has become a pressing issue for authorities in Port-Au-Prince. 'The gangs forced us out. I lost my parents – my mother and father. The gangs burned them alive in the house, and now we can’t go back,' one refugee told Reuters. Besides the recent introduction of an 800-strong UN peacekeeping force, little else has been done to quell the violence that has ravaged the island. In December, gang leader Micanor 'Mikanò' Altès was accused by the Haitian government of carrying out a massacre of nearly 200 people, following accusations of witchcraft in regard to his child’s illness. 'The massacre was triggered by the severe illness of his child. Micanor sought advice from a voodoo priest (‘bókò’) who accused elderly people in the area of practicing witchcraft and harming the child,' a report referenced by CNN said. 'On Friday, December 6, Micanor shot and killed at least 60 elderly individuals. On Saturday, December 7, he and his group killed at least 50 more using machetes and knives. Despite his actions, his ill child passed away. In addition, violence and political instability have brought the island to the brink of all-out famine. According to a report from the Food Security Phase Classification, over 5 million Haitians in September were at risk for starvation, with 18% facing emergency-level hunger. From a logistical perspective, holding elections in this environment may not even be possible. The amount of investment required by the state to organize such a polarizing event would require a level of both hard and soft power which Haiti severely lacks. Furthermore, even if elections were successfully held, the legitimacy of such a contest would immediately be called into question, considering that Port-au-Prince lacks territorial sovereignty over its own country. Will competing gangs allow Haitians to even vote? Could polling booths become the next victim of the unmitigated violence that these gangs have wrought over the island? By almost every facet at thus juncture, holding elections in Haiti would not only prove irresponsible, but perhaps impossible altogether. Ballots can’t feed the hungry. Nor does campaigning and electoral posturing do much to stabilize a failed state. While the consistent pursuit of the democratic tradition is ultimately in Haiti’s best interest, the timing for that noble experiment may be slightly off. Voltaire’s push to form a democratically elected government is admirable, but it does little to solve the very pressing issues currently facing his country. Achieving democratic representation must be the final step in a long, drawn-out process towards rejuvenation. Elections won’t save Haiti; only a concerted, national program for recovery can do that.

What We Learned From High-Stakes US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia ...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Top U.S. and Russian officials have finished their first talks on ending the war in Ukraine, with the Kremlin voicing new demands as Washington and Moscow agreed to move quickly to normalize their ties and begin negotiations around the nearly three-year conflict. The more than four-hour meeting in Riyadh -- which was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- is part of a major diplomatic push by the United States to bring the war to an end. The discussions were framed by U.S. officials as exploratory talks that could pave the way for a potential in-person meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rubio told reporters after the February 18 meeting in the Saudi capital that the talks were 'the first step of a long and difficult journey' over ending the war in Ukraine and that the U.S. and Russian delegations agreed on four principles during their discussions. These comprise fully restoring their diplomatic missions in Washington and Moscow after years of sanctions and expulsions, appointing a high-level team to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, exploring further 'geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from an end to the conflict in Ukraine,' and ensuring that the U.S. and Russian delegations present in Riyadh will remain engaged in discussions moving forward. Lavrov called the meeting 'very useful' and said Moscow would aim to appoint a special envoy as soon as possible. 'I have every reason to believe that the American side understands our position,' Lavrov said. Russia's chief foreign policy adviser, Yury Ushakov, who was part of the country's delegation, added that the two sides briefly discussed the conditions needed for a Putin-Trump summit. However, he added that the decision to begin deeper talks with the United States about Ukraine would ultimately rest with Putin himself. 'It's useful for the Trump administration's senior national-security team to hear these Russian positions and they can take them back to the president,' John Deni, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told RFE/RL. 'It's still too early to know what the Russians might be willing to give up or hold onto.' Key Takeaways From Saudi Meeting (Diplomatic) Boots On The Ground. The two sides agreed to re-staff their diplomatic posts in Washington and Moscow. It's a diplomatic spat that predates the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, stretching into the first Trump administration (dozens expelled on both sides), and even the Obama administration, which also shuttered two diplomatic compounds in the States. Putting more diplomats on the ground is, by all accounts, fairly noncontroversial. For its part, the Kremlin signaled prior to Riyadh it wants those compounds back. Give Peace A Chance. The delegations agreed to create a high-level team to focus specifically on the Ukraine conflict. But the devil is in the details: Is NATO membership off the table? European peacekeepers? More weapons for Kyiv? Fewer sanctions for Moscow? We won't get any hints of what's on the table for weeks. Something else to watch: a side comment made earlier by Putin in the Kremlin readout of his call with Trump, which referenced 'root causes' of the Ukraine war. If it pops up again, it may augur bad news for Ukrainian independence or autonomy. 'Closer Relations And Economic Cooperation.' That can mean pretty much anything, but one bit of low-hanging fruit for closer relations is space cooperation. Russia and the United States for years largely succeeded in shielding their joint space work from politics. That's atrophied in recent years. Signing a new agreement between NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, would be an easy, noncontroversial move. What Came From The Meetings? The meeting appears to have laid the foundation for future talks between Moscow and Washington, with both Rubio and Lavrov saying each side will restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow to create missions to support Ukraine peace talks, bilateral relations, and cooperation more broadly. In a statement, the U.S. State Department said delegations from both countries have agreed to 'address irritants' in their ties with the goal of normalizing diplomatic relations after years of tensions. Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said both countries will explore 'future cooperation' but cautioned an exact timeline still remains unclear, noting, 'One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace.'She added the Riyadh talks are an early step in a longer process. Lavrov said the two sides 'practically agreed' that they need to resolve issues concerning the functioning of diplomatic missions. On Ukraine, he said there was 'a mutual desire' to find solutions and Russia will wait for the United States to appoint its representatives. 'After that, relevant consultations will begin and will be regular,' he said. The Russian foreign minister added the potential of any deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine -- which has been floated by some Western governments -- would be a 'completely unacceptable' proposal for the Kremlin. Separately, Russian officials said a long-term peace deal in Ukraine will not be possible without addressing a wider range of security concerns across Europe. 'A comprehensive long-term settlement is impossible without a comprehensive consideration of security issues on the continent,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on February 18. Peskov also said Putin would be open to talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'if necessary.' Putin had previously said he was unwilling to negotiate with Zelenskyy because his rule is 'illegitimate,' in part because Ukraine has not held elections since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. Speaking in Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow wants NATO to disavow its 2008 promise to one day give Ukraine membership of the military alliance, and for Kyiv to agree to neutrality. What Happens Next? Both sides all agreed to appoint envoys and continue talks moving forward. Rubio also hinted at a role for the EU further down the line, saying that 'there are other parties that have sanctions, the European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.' Jana Puglierin, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said both Kyiv and its European allies have watched anxiously from the sidelines as U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh and worries are high in Ukraine and European capitals that Trump could cut a hasty deal with Moscow that ignores their security interests. She says European leaders are currently grappling with multiple 'turning points' set off by Russia launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as well as recent comments by top U.S. officials suggesting Europe will need to play a larger part in security issues. 'February 2022 destroyed our faith in a collective security order with Russia and showed us the dark side of our fundamental dependence on Russia and China in critical areas,' she said. 'February 2025 shows us that the Americans no longer feel responsible for European security -- and that their interests are fundamentally different from ours.' European leaders held emergency talks in Paris on February 17 to discuss the war in Ukraine and European security matters but were unable to reach any agreement. Following the meeting in Saudi Arabia, U.S. national-security adviser Michael Waltz said any postwar peace guarantee would have to be 'European-led,' echoing calls by U.S. officials for European allies to increase defense spending and praising Britain and France for 'talking about contributing more forcefully to Ukraine's security.'Zeleneskyy has criticized the talks due to their lack of a Ukrainian representative and he called for 'fair' peace talks about ending the war, arguing they should also involve the European Union, Turkey, and Britain. The Atlantic Council's Deni said any potential settlement that can be reached is still likely far off and will require further discussions with Ukraine and European governments. He added the meeting in Riyadh should be seen as the latest U.S. attempt to reset relations with Russia, following similar efforts by former President George W. Bush in 2001 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Each of those diplomatic pushes ended with strained ties and new geopolitical flashpoints in Georgia and Ukraine. 'At a certain point you need to speak to your adversary and diplomacy needs to be in the U.S. toolbox,' Deni said. 'Reset efforts make sense, but in the past they've ended in disappointment.'

US Energy Department Offers Fresh Figures On Caspian Basin Energy...	(Eurasianet) -- A new US Department of Energy survey provides updated data on oil & natural gas production in the CaspianBasin. It shows that four regional states – Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – collectively account for 3 percent of global energy production. The Regional Analysis Brief: Caspian Sea additionally provides an overview of regional coal production, power generation and energy export routes, as well as a breakdown of regional refinery operations. Azerbaijan possesses oil reserves in 2025 of about 7 billion barrels and gas reserves of about 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), according to the US Energy Department report. Virtually all production is generated offshore. Oil production has fallen from nearly 1 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2010 to an estimated 600,000 b/d currently. Natural gas production, meanwhile, achieved a record high in 2023 (the last year for which data is available), totaling 1.3 Tcf. Azerbaijan is maximizing gas production to meet ambitious EU supply commitments. Kazakhstan’s proven oil reserves topped 30 billion barrels in 2025 and gas reserves were pegged at 85 Tcf. About 1.5 million b/d of crude oil and 400,000 b/d of petroleum liquid fuels were extracted in 2024. The country produced 1 Tcf of natural gas, most of which was used for domestic consumption. About a third of the gas extracted 'was reinjected to increase oil production,' according to the Energy Department survey, which adds that 'natural gas produced at [the] Tengiz and Kashagan [fields] generally is high in sulfur and so, requires special handling and additional expense to process.' Turkmenistan possesses the world’s fifth highest proven natural gas reserves, 400 Tcf in 2025, the report states. Dry natural gas production reached 3.0 Tcf in 2023, the highest annual total since records started being kept in 1992. Most exports presently head east to China, but Ashgabat is looking to expand export options, including southward via a trans-Afghanistan route. The Energy Department highlights an obstacle to expanding Turkmen gas exports to Europe. 'High methane emissions from its oil and natural gas fields threaten Turkmenistan’s prospects to enter the European natural gas market via a potential Trans Caspian Pipeline,' it notes. Turkmen oil reserves are comparatively minor, totaling 600 million barrels, with annual production reaching 275,000 b/d in 2024. Like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan’s oil reserves are relatively negligible at 594 million barrels, with production of 63,000 b/d in 2024, about one-third the level of the country’s peak production 25 years ago. Proven Uzbek gas reserves are 65 Tcf, with production reaching 1.5 Tcf in 2023. Uzbekistan is the only one of the four states covered in the Energy Department report that cannot meet its own energy consumption needs. Kazakhstan is the eighth leading coal producer in the world and the only major producer among the four Caspian states surveyed. About 130 million short tons of coal were extracted in Kazakhstan in 2023, with almost 40 million tons exported. Most of the extracted coal, including exports, was used for electricity generation. Coal is additionally 'a major energy source for the mining and smelting industries,' the report states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwWb1z8jIBcnT	2025-02-18T17:01:09-08:00	
EU’s Top Diplomat Kallas Warns Peacekeeping Is A Putin Trap – Int...	By Alexandra Brzozowski Top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas warned in an interview with Euractiv that Europe's discussion over a possible peacekeeping force in Ukraine risks playing into a 'Russian trap'. Just one day after an emergency meeting of European leaders in Paris, Kallas cautioned that attempts to find a coalition for a peacekeeping mission was premature, as the Russians 'don't want peace, there is no peace.' Before those discussions, she said, Europe's focus should be on putting Ukraine in a position where they are 'able to say no to a bad deal', and that 'the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table.' What follows is an edited transcript. What are your takeaways from how the American 'shock therapy' has been developing since last Wednesday? It's clear that Europe is not at the table in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh... KALLAS: Of course, the Americans can meet with whomever they wish to, but for any peace deal regarding Ukraine to work, it has to involve the Europeans as well as the Ukrainians. What options do we have if Trump refuses to include Europeans in the talks, even at a later stage, as his Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg has suggested? KALLAS: If some deal is agreed that we don't agree to, then it will just fail, because it will not be implemented. Washington seems to have drawn its red lines last week; what should Europe's red lines be when it comes to security guarantees for Ukraine specifically? KALLAS: They walked back from the red lines, because of the reaction they received. It is important that before the negotiations have even started, you don't give away all the main asks that Russia has. Otherwise, Russia's aggression really pays off: not only have they occupied some territory – so they have additional territory and mineral resources – but then on top of this, they get all these promises from the other side as well. I don't think it's a good negotiation tactic, nor is it strong. We have, from our side, put in place conditions that need to be there. But first, we really need to put pressure on Russia – that is the first element here. Right now, if you also look at the images from Saudi Arabia, the Russians are the winners. Their posture is: 'Everybody is coming to us now and offering us what we want'. Let's not walk into the Russian traps. What assurances have you received from the American side that the peace talks will not include any broader restructuring of Europe’s security architecture? The Russians will undoubtedly try to go in that direction... KALLAS: We had meetings with a lot of Americans, and, in general, we got different messages, even from the same people, in different meetings. How to understand it all is, of course, a question. What they are saying to us in the meetings is that they will not agree on anything like this. As there are many interlocutors on the American side, we need to accommodate ourselves to the new ways of working with the new administration to understand all the messages. The Americans assured us in every meeting that they were committed to Europe and working together. They're committed to NATO and understand the security concerns of Europe. It is clear that Europeans will be the ones asked to secure any kind of future deal, but the Paris summit has not produced concrete plans. How fast can we come up with a plan? And why didn't we have one in place in the first place? KALLAS: Again, if we are talking about peacekeepers, then we are walking into the Russian trap because they don't want peace; there is no peace. If you read the comments of the Russians, they were quite happy; they had already won everything. First, we have to put pressure on Putin so he wants to move towards peace. The Ukrainians say presence for the sake of presence is not feasible. Under what mandate could such a force work? KALLAS: If the discussion comes to this, then we can discuss it, but we are not at this point. Right now, we should focus our strength on supporting Ukraine and the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table. We should put Ukraine in a position [of strength] where they are able to say no to a bad deal. Arguably, we had three years to do that, to put them in a 'position of strength'? KALLAS: You can't imagine how frustrated I am that this is three years now. Yesterday someone was telling me, 'but the defence industry needs time'. I mean, they have had time. They have had time for three years when the war has been a full-scale war. It's not only a question of the sovereignty of Ukraine. It's a question of our sovereignty, of the global world as we know it, where might does not make a right. Yes, we have had a lot of time, but on the positive side, I remember the shock of 24 February 2022 when things started to happen. I feel that now we are in the same position. I am relatively optimistic that we will get our act together. But do you see the danger that now that peace talks have officially started and there is a perspective of the war ending, the urgency will disappear? KALLAS: In many societies, there is this will to pack things up, and go back to business as usual. We also have to understand that any kind of bad deal is just a deal for Russia to regroup and attack again. With every hesitation, the price just goes up. Making investments in defence right now requires painful decisions from all societies, but not making them would come at a higher cost later. If we draw the parallels with history, then we are in the situation of 1938. The difference now is that, unlike Czechoslovakia, Ukraine has now decided to fight. The only ask for us is to reallocate our resources and help them to defend themselves so there will be no Second World War. I don't know how to convey this to the public of different member states. What will you do if the US lifts sanctions? It seems that this could be part of the mix at some point. What do we do then? KALLAS: It is not wise to give up the strong card that we have in our hands. Why do the Russians want the lifting of sanctions? Because they hurt them and they want to go back to business as usual. This is the strong card that we have in our hands, and we shouldn't give it away. We shouldn't underestimate our own power because what we see is that their economy is in a very bad situation: Their national fund is almost completely depleted, and their national bank interest rate is over 20%, which is, by the way, worse than Haiti's. They can't raise capital outside because of the [Western] sanctions. They don't get the same revenues from oil and gas that they used to, and their employment market is in a really bad place. They want us to believe that they are the strong ones here, but actually, it is not true, and we should not walk into that trap.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwR4bg70trmc9	2025-02-18T16:57:03-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Two-Pronged Strategy To Gut The ‘Deep State’ – OpE...	By Alfredo Toro Hardy US President Donald Trump is convinced that the 'deep state' thwarted his first term, robbing him of the 2020 election. Expunging it seems to have become his main priority of this second term. But, is there such a thing as a deep state? There certainly is. It would be enough to read the memoirs of former US presidents or secretaries to discover their frustration in face of the bureaucratic resistance confronted while in office. In this regard, those of former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, written a few decades ago, were particularly enlightening. The following excerpts from his Memoirs speak volumes. They referred to the interaction between the White House and the Pentagon: 'Orders were given in that respect, but our military bureaucracy resists intromissions in strategic doctrine even if they come from the White House (…) When I assumed my functions, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told me that he too had tried to give more options to the President in strategic matters, but he finally desisted given the bureaucratic resistance (…) A 1969 presidential request demanding a reasoned explanation on the naval programs was never satisfactorily answered during the eight years that I served in Washington. The responses given were always close to insubordination and far from being useful.' The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis had also much to tell in this regard. One of the main reasons that led Nikita Khruschev, the Secretary General of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, to install missiles in Cuba was the presence of American missiles in Turkey, bordering the Soviet Union. US President John F. Kennedy understood the risks involved therein. Several months before the crisis, he had ordered that the US’s missiles be removed, as they represented an unnecessary provocation. However, bureaucratic resistance both within the State Department and the Department of Defense thwarted the implementation of such orders, which were never carried out. Moreover, during the infamous 13 days of the crisis, the US Navy was reluctant to obey the president’s orders with regard to the Cuban naval blockade. While Kennedy wanted to give Khruschev time to see, think and blink, bureaucracy within the Navy did all it could to circumvent those orders and put in place its own book of procedures. Additionally, when tensions between both countries peaked, and war could have ensued at any moment, an American spy plane crashed in Siberia. The Air Force bureaucracy had kept its regular procedures in place, notwithstanding Kennedy’s insistence on acting with the utmost prudence. The deep state, indeed, exists. It represents the natural impulse of the federal bureaucracy to act in accordance with its own institutional aims, set of rules and particular subculture. Seeing presidents and secretaries as simple snowbirds, bureaucratic loyalties are entrenched within their own institutions. For someone like Trump who, more than requiring loyalty for his agenda demands fealty to his person, this represents the worst of sins. Indeed, 'he demands personal loyalty—or what John Bolton, Trump’s longest-serving national security adviser in his first term, has called ‘fealty, a medieval concept implying not mere loyalty but submission.’' The interaction of complete opposites such as these can only lead to a trainwreck. Trump’s pincers: destabilizing federal departments from both sides In his second term, Trump aims to bend the federal bureaucracy into submission through a pincer strategy. One jaw pursues its destabilization from the inside by putting federal departments and offices under the control of well-known disrupters. The other jaw harasses and destabilizes these organizations from the outside. The avowed intention of this dual process is taming bureaucrats by making them feel vulnerable and insecure, by demolishing their sense of entitlement and career safety. In the words of Russell Vought, the new Director of the Office of Management and Budget: 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.' The first jaw, thus, is entrusted to people that have 'sworn' personal allegiance to Trump. Experience or knowledge regarding their assigned area is not an employment requisite, though. An important historical precedent in this regard dates back to 12th-century England. Faced with the Church’s resistance to his rule, Henry II of Plantagenet decided to appoint his closest friend, the conspicuous dissolute Thomas Becket, as Archbishop of Canterbury. The problem ended up being that Becket realized that his true base of power resided in the Church that he was supposed to 'rule,' and not in the king that had put him in charge. As the king’s man, he was fated to be institutionally resisted, thus becoming feeble and ineffectual. Contrariwise, by submitting to the Church’s interests and organizational subculture, he could personify the political might of that institution. Hence, he sided with the Church. This phenomenon is well known in contemporary US politics. For a political appointee, siding with the bureaucratic organization is known as 'going native.' When a secretary becomes a 'native' of the Department that they were chosen to lead, they acquire real power. Otherwise, the risk of remaining as an inefficacious figurehead is always present. Conscious of that reality, US presidents tend to choose figures with knowledge of the subjects involved, but at the same time with sufficient personal standing and integrity. The former is to avoid manipulation from the inside of the organization. The latter is for them to promote workable compromises between bureaucratic and political objectives. Although an imperfect solution, it is a pragmatic one. Trump, however, searches for absolutes. He not only wants personal allegiance from his barons but for them to forcefully control their fiefs. This is why he places so much importance in choosing disruptive figures, people susceptible of exacting obedience under the continuous threat of chaos. This translates into management by fear. However, installing fear from the inside may not be enough. That is why the second jaw of the pincer searches to project it from the outside as well. It does so through a blistering shake-up of federal bureaucracy: shutting down or dismantling agencies, ousting federal appointees before their term has ended, planning large-scale layoffs, reviewing the elimination or combination of bureaucratic divisions or entire agencies, transforming civil servants’ failure to implement the president’s will into cause for disciplining and separation. All this and more. Much of the above is being done in overt violation of the US Constitution’s separation of power. Since the inception of the Republic, indeed, it has always been the legislative branch that decides how to structure the executive branch, creating departments, giving them functions and providing their funds. Not anymore. So far, though, judicial authority in this field has been respected. However, a furious rhetoric on challenging the judiciary builds up in the president’s camp. All of this, of course, must be sending shock waves of fright upon federal bureaucrats, who feel that they may no longer be protected by the rule of law. Trump’s strategy may damage the US No doubt about it, this pincer strategy could be utterly effective in domesticating the deep state, rendering it docile. The problem is that it can disassemble the State itself in the process. It can, indeed, make a big mess of federal institutions, procedures and civil service, degrading the capacity for policy implementation and distorting institutional memory and governance know-how. Additionally, it can dangerously meddle with the Constitutional separation of power. Hammering the foundations upon which the federal government and the branches of government depend for their functioning, is indeed a risky business — one that could turn a global superpower upside down and set in motion a spiral of decline. Frankly speaking, though, a good dose of pure deep state doesn’t seem like such a bad thing, when faced with proposals such as turning Gaza into an American Riviera while permanently expelling the Palestinian population, retaking the Panama Canal or absorbingGreenland. And what about Trump’s repeated questioning of Canada’s viability as a nation and his threats to annex it through economic force? Indeed, the US might need its deep state.

US Government’s Excessive Spending Scandal Grows Bigger – OpEd	Members of the Biden-Harris administration went on a massive spending bender during their final four months in office. By that, I mean they figuratively blew a hole in the U.S. government’s budget as they headed out the door. This assessment is not included in the January 2025 Monthly Treasury Statement, which provides data on the U.S. government’s spending and revenues during its 2025 fiscal year to date. The statement covers the period from October 1, 2024, through January 31, 2025. During these four months, the U.S. government spent $2.44 trillion and collected $1.60 trillion in taxes. The difference between the amount spent and the federal government’s revenues is $840 billion. That deficit represents the biggest fiscal hole ever dug by any presidential administration during the first four months of any fiscal year. The chart below reveals how the U.S. government’s spending compares with the previous two fiscal years. Looking at revenue first, the federal government’s tax collections through January 2025 are slightly ahead of what they were a year ago. That’s good because the U.S. government collected a record amount of taxes in its 2024 fiscal year. It is on track to beat it in 2025. A lack of revenue is not the problem. The Real Problem The improvement in revenue is almost unnoticeable because it is dwarfed by the massive increase in spending. Cumulative spending through the first four months of FY 2025 is 15% higher than it was at the same point in FY 2024. It is also over 26% higher than FY 2023’s cumulative spending. The excessive spending is clearly unsustainable. It is so unsustainable that it raises the very good question of how they were spending it. The news in recent weeks was filled with horror stories about the role of USAID in contributing to the Biden-Harris administration’s flood of spending. But that’s just a drop in the bucket of government waste. The real problem is much bigger. This realization leads to more questions. How many other federal government agencies were also involved in the Biden-Harris administration’s growing spending scandal? Where has the money entrusted to their control gone? A full accounting of the excessive spending of U.S. politicians and bureaucrats is long overdue. They owe nothing less to the American people.

Trump’s Revival Of Lincoln’s ‘Colonization’ Plan – OpEd	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo Now that the US and Israeli military has bombed almost all of Gaza into a smoldering ruin and killed tens or hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, President Trump has proposed getting Jordan and Egypt to house the remaining Palestinians. He has threatened to withdraw US taxpayer 'aid' to these countries if they do not accept his proposal. This is essentially a revival of Lincoln’s lifelong dream of deporting or 'colonizing' all of the black people out of the United States. Roy Basler, the editor of The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, wrote that as of 1857 Lincoln had no policy regarding slavery 'except the colonization idea which he inherited from Henry Clay.' When he was asked what was to happen to the slaves should they ever be freed he said, 'Send them to Liberia, to their own native land.' As president Lincoln held a White House meeting with free black men and implored them to lead by example and resettle in Africa. They wisely declined his offer. He did develop plans to send every last black person to Africa, Haiti, Central America, anywhere but in the US. As Phil Magness and Sebastian Page documented in their book, Colonization after Emancipation, Lincoln and his administration were hard at work until his dying day counting how many ships it would take to deport or 'colonize,' as they said, all the black people. Henry Clay was Lincoln’s professed political idol and role model. In his 1852 eulogy to Clay Lincoln praised him as a founding member of the American Colonization Society and said that 'colonization' was one of his 'most cherished objects.' Lincoln approvingly quoted Clay in the eulogy as having said that 'there is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children.' It would be 'a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe,' he said. Lincoln himself said that sending all the black people to Africa would be 'the ultimate redemption of the African race' and that every year 'had added strength to the hope of its [deportation] realization. May indeed it be realized!' In his December 1, 1862 message to Congress Lincoln reiterated that 'I cannot make it better known that it already is, that I strongly favor colonization.' One major benefit of 'colonization,' Lincoln said was that 'their places [i.e., jobs] be . . . filled up by free white laborers.' At the time, only adult white males or 'free white laborers' had the right to vote. Lincoln was the manager of the Illinois Colonization Society before becoming president, and the Society got the Illinois legislature to allocate tax funds for the purpose of deporting the small number of free blacks out of the state. As president Lincoln appointed Senator Samuel Pomeroy to supervise 'resettlement effort.' Pomeroy recommended deporting black people to a new Central American colony that would be named 'Lincolnia.' The Lincoln administration paid a businessman named Bernard Kock to establish a colony in Haiti but Kock turned out to be a crook and an embezzler so nothing came of it. All of this caused the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to declare that Lincoln 'had not a drop of anti-slavery blood in his veins' and called him 'The President of African Colonization.' Of course the Lincoln Cult has dozens of excuses for Lincoln’s Ku Klux Klanish attitude towards black people. They claimed for generations that Lincoln somehow gave up on the idea in 1863 but the book Colonization after Emancipation proved that to be untrue. The well known Civil War historian Gabor Boritt wrote in his edited book, The Lincoln Enigma, that Lincoln’s colonization proposals were 'noble.' He concocts numerous rationales and excuses, which after all is what makes one a 'Lincoln Scholar.' The most entertaining excuse is his statement that Lincoln’s lifelong advocacy of colonization is 'how honest people lie.' A perfect example of what makes one a 'Lincoln Scholar.' President Trump’s proposal to colonize Palestinians in Jordan or Egypt is hardly different from Lincoln’s colonization fetish. Both men treat a group of people as lepers who should be eradicated from society and who should be denied property rights in their own country no matter how many generations their family has lived there. Lincoln’s rationale was the subtitle of Lerone Bennett, Jr.’s book Forced into Glory: 'Abraham Lincoln’s White Dream.' (Bennett was the long time editor of Ebony magazine and an author of several books). As for Trump, his rationale seems to be payback for the $100 million campaign donation from Miriam Adelson and the prospect of participating in the Mother of All Real Estate Developments in the Middle East.

To Bomb Or Not To Bomb Iran – OpEd	By Jonathan Power The talk is talk. Or will it walk? President Donald Trump has raised the stakes once again, repeating the threats against Iran in his first term. It all goes back many years. Mitt Romney, the US Republican candidate for the presidency, said that on his watch Iran would not be allowed to build a nuclear weapon but that on his watch, if elected, the future president, Barack Obama, would let it happen. In an issue of Foreign Affairs, a mouthpiece of the American foreign affairs establishment, Mathew Kroenig penned soon after Obama took office an article, 'Time to Attack Iran. The time for talk is over', he wrote. Foreign policy analysts seem to overlook that it was the US who encouraged the Shah 75 years ago to begin Iran’s nuclear programme. The first discussion I attended on whether Iran was wanting a bomb was at the International Institute for Strategic Studies some 40 years ago. Experts were saying we should expect a bomb within a decade. Time passes but the argument barely change and no bomb has been made. All one knows is that in all this time many opportunities for a sensible negotiation have been ignored. 'Enormously difficult' to destroy Iran’s nuclear plant Kroenig wrote that, 'If Iran begins enriching its uranium to weapons grade levels of 90% or installs advanced centrifuges at its uranium-enrichment facility in Qom the US must strike immediately.' While admitting that it would be 'enormously difficult' to destroy Iran’s nuclear plant, Kroenig argued it could and should be done. New bunker-busting bombs would take care of underground facilities. They can penetrate through 200 feet of reinforced concrete. However, he admitted that the one at Qom would be a challenging target since it is built into the side of a mountain. He tried to knock down those critics who point out that Iran could retaliate, launching missiles at US military installations in the Gulf, closing the Strait of Hormuz, the relatively narrow (but not that narrow) water that tankers pass through at the opening to the Persian Gulf, firing missiles into Israel and activating proxies abroad. The US, he argues, could retaliate with devastating military action. Iran won’t be able to resume progress after its entire nuclear infrastructure is reduced to rubble. He discounts much—that this would strengthen Iran’s hardliners as it did in Germany after the blanket bombing of Dresden. Thankfully, the pro bomb faction has been undermined by many observers including Israeli’s ex-prime minister, Ehud Barak, who has long said that any decision on an Israeli attack on Iran was 'very far off'. Many experts believe that Iran has not yet decided whether to make a nuclear bomb. Perhaps too one should not overlook statements made by the hierarchy of Iran in this very religious country that it goes against the Koran to build a weapon of mass destruction. Could they justify lying to God? Another Middle Eastern war? Added to that, Koenig underestimates how Iran is building safer and safer hideaways. It can match any bomb by digging deeper. Does the US want to get drawn into another Middle Eastern war which would have serious spill-over effects in further radicalising Pakistan, Afghanistan, Palestine and big chunks of the population throughout the Middle East? Interestingly, some Israeli policymakers appear to have got the message some time ago. According to a poll conducted by the American Brookings Institution and the Israeli Dahaf Institute only a minority of Israeli Jews support a military strike even though 90% of them think Iran will eventually acquire nuclear weapons. When asked whether it would be better for both Israel and Iran not to have such weapons 65% of the Jews said 'yes'. Support for the idea of a nuclear-free zone A remarkable 64% support the idea of a nuclear-free zone. Moreover, a freeze has been supported by such unexpected characters as the former Mossad (intelligence) chief, Tair Pardo, a former Mossad chief, Ephraim Halevy, and a former chief of staff of the military, Dan Halutz. Could Iran refuse the proposition of a nuclear-free zone, if it came from Israel? The Israeli government has always put the cart before the horse. It says a nuclear-free zone cannot be considered until there is peace between Israel and its neighbours. But the answer to that, argues Harvard professor, Nicolas Burns, is there will be no peace as long as Iran and Israel are at loggerheads. Since Israel is the one who possesses an arsenal of nuclear weapons it must be the first to take steps towards reconciliation. He quotes the former Israeli spy chief, Meir Dagan, who has argued that Israel’s current stance might accelerate Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons and encourage other Arab states to follow suit. Under President Barack Obama the US accepted that talking with Iran was the best option, and after gruelling negotiations a deal was signed. Iran’s enrichment program was halted and the US lifted sanctions. But then his successor Donald Trump tore up the agreement and for 7 years nothing has been done on the diplomatic front, although sanctions have continued. Trump in his first term and now again has threatened war if Iran shows signs of moving towards 90% enrichment. That truly would be a nose-to-nose confrontation. I think there is a better way for America to do it—stop trying to pull Iran down. But with Trump in office, we must prepare for the worst. Trump might well want to walk the talk.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwUy1G_ajCdhn	2025-02-18T16:43:11-08:00	
Kremlin Tells Russia Media To Play Down Trump Lest He Upstage Put...	After US President Donald Trump telephoned Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, the Russian Presidential Administration instructed state-run and pro-government media to 'downplay Trump’s role and mention the US president less often – lest it appear as though Trump is achieving the results Putin failed to deliver,' according to the Meduza news agency. The independent Russian news portal based in Riga says that the Kremlin is 'concerned that Russians might start seeing Trump as a more pro-active and decisive leader than Putin.' And 't prevent this, officials directed journalists to emphasize that the outcome of any talks depends entirely on Putin' (meduza.io/feature/2025/02/14/sozvon-putina-i-trampa-kazhetsya-otlichnym-informatsionnym-povodom-dlya-prokremlevskih-smi). 'A political strategist working with the domestic policy team told Meduza that the Kremlin doesn’t want Trump to be perceived as ‘a strong leader capable of changing the situation.’' That could create a situation in which Putin might 'appear passive – in other words, weak – in comparison.' The news outlet’s source said that Moscow had 'also instructed Russian media outlets to scale back the numbers mentioning Trump, not only with regard to foreign policy but also concerning US domestic policies.' Meduza said that it already sees that some of the Russian government outlets have already adjusted their coverage of the US president.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwXX1Nypx-VYH	2025-02-18T16:39:20-08:00	
Real Corruption That Could Meet Republican Cost-Saving Targets – ...	The news has been filled with stories in recent days about Republicans desperately hunting for $2.0-$2.5 trillion (2-3 percent of the budget) in budget cuts over the next decade to cover the cost of extending tax cuts to the rich. While Elon Musk and his DOGE team have been screaming about corruption all through the government, they actually have found little that can be helpful here. They appear to have found virtually nothing by way of actual corruption. Most of what they have been screaming about are small-budget allocations having to do with race, gender, or sexual orientation that they don’t like. Individually these programs are nickel and dime stuff, and even collectively they won’t come close to covering the cost of the tax cuts that Elon Musk and his billionaire friends need so badly. Instead, the committees in the House and Senate working on designing a budget have focused on cutting Medicaid and SNAP, two programs that largely serve low and moderate-income families. The cuts being debated, if implemented, would deny tens of millions of people access to health care and reduce nutritional support that has meant a huge difference for millions of low-income children. The cuts to Medicaid would also have a devastating impact on rural hospitals since it is a major source of revenue. Many would probably have to close. But if the Republicans really want to find savings by eliminating government corruption, there is an obvious place to look. We pay twice as much for our drugs and other pharmaceutical products as people in other wealthy countries. The reason is that the government grants them patent monopolies. While other governments also grant patent monopolies, they also negotiate drug prices or have some other mechanism that limits the ability of pharmaceutical companies to exploit these monopolies. The United States is alone in granting drug companies monopolies and then telling them to charge whatever they feel like. It’s true that patent monopolies give the industry an incentive to develop new drugs, but we can provide that incentive through other mechanisms, like direct public funding. We had been providing over $50 billion a year in direct funding through the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. In the longer term we can increase this funding and let the new drugs that are developed be sold as cheap generics. This would also end the incentives to lie about the safety and effectiveness of drugs that led to the opioid crisis. (I discuss this in chapter 5 of my book, Rigged [it’s free].) If we began to follow the practice of France, Germany, and everyone else, we could cut our drug bill in half or more. We are on a path to spend over $700 billion this year on pharmaceutical products. If we cut that in half by negotiating prices, that would save us more than $350 billion this year, well over the Republicans’ saving target. It’s true that not all of this spending is done by the government, so the government would not directly be able to pocket all the savings, but it would likely get pretty close to its saving targets through this channel. In addition to the roughly half of spending that is paid by directly the government, the government subsidizes much of the rest through tax deductions. People don’t pay taxes on employer-provided health insurance. If lower drug prices led insurers to reduce annual premiums by $100 billion, this is likely to lead to an increase in taxable income of roughly the same amount. And that would mean higher tax revenue. In short, the Republicans and the DOGE crew are staring at an obvious place to save big bucks by slashing corruption, if they are prepared to go after the pharmaceutical industry with the same vigor that they have gone after programs they labeled as 'DEI' or individuals who have tried to enforce the law when Donald Trump violated it. Unfortunately, the Republicans in Congress are probably as scared of the pharmaceutical industry as they are of Donald Trump. This means we shouldn’t hold out breath waiting for lower drug prices. They will probably look to take away food and health care from low and moderate-income people. It is their way.

Trump International Hotel And Tower, Gaza – OpEd	Donald Trump spoke to reporters for over three hours on Air Force One on his way to see the Super Bowl in New Orleans on 9 February 2025. It was not clear to the reporters who broadcast his comments whether Trump was speaking as the President of the United States, a member of the United Nations, or as a real estate magnate. Gaza, he said, is a 'demolition site' that needed to be 'leveled out' and 'fixed up'. Since Gaza is on the Mediterranean Sea, Trump said, it could be developed into a new French Riviera. According to him, it is not the crime scene of a genocide but 'a big real estate site'. The United States, he said with his presidential smile on, 'will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too'. Palestinians from Gaza listening to this commentary could have imagined that the United States would be funding the reconstruction of Gaza, which has been estimated by the United Nations to be – at a minimum – $53 billion (the cost after the 2014 pulverization of Gaza by Israel was $2.4 billion). In 2023, total US Overseas Development Aid was $66 billion, and, with the cuts proclaimed by President Trump, it is unlikely that the US can muster anything near the bill for the reconstruction of Gaza. There was nothing humanitarian in Trump’s comments about the making of the Gaza Riviera (or since this appears to be a gift to Israel, it is more likely that Trump imagines it to be the Azzah Riviera, using the Zionist name for Gaza, meaning 'strong city'). The Israeli establishment has, from the start of this genocidal campaign, said that it wants to annex Gaza, which seems to be aligned with the Trump vision to make Gaza American or to develop Gaza as a beachside resort for U.S. tourists and Israeli settlers. Knowing Trump, he will likely want to reserve a section of the beachfront for himself and to build a Trump International Hotel and Tower that has a casino attached to it for good measure. Zionist Gentrification None of this is a surprise and nor are these ideas original to Trump. The entire Zionist project imagines an Eretz Israel that stretches from the borders with Egypt to that of Iran. The real estate deed for this is a line in the Bible, 'To your descendants, I have given this land, from the river of Egypt as far as the great river the Euphrates' (Genesis 15:18). It is not clear which river in Egypt this line refers to, whether the Nile or Wadi el-Arish (in the Sinai Peninsula). But if the Euphrates is taken as its border, then the land that Zionists claim includes the entire West Bank and Jerusalem, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the western half of Iraq. There are maps of this kind that can be seen in the offices of far-right Israeli politicians (on 19 March, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich spoke in Paris from a podium that displayed an Israeli map that included Jordan). This is utterly normal in the world of the illegal settlements in the West Bank (part of the UN-mandated Occupied Palestine Territory), which the settlers call Judea and Samaria. Their geography has been different since at least when their spiritual guide Ze’ev Jabotinsky wrote in The Iron Wall(1923) that Zionists must build Eretz Israel behind an 'iron wall, which is to say a strong power in Palestine that is not amenable to any Arab pressure'. Trump is not much of a reader. He probably has never heard of Jabotinsky or of Theodor Herzl. He probably cannot define Zionism. But he knows a real estate opportunity when he sees one, and that is how he has understood his solution to the problems facing Israel. In his first term, Trump made the 'deal of the century', the Abraham Accords, which brought a series of states to normalize relations with Israel: Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (September 2020), Sudan (October 2020), and Morocco (December 2020). With Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994) having already made peace deals with Israel, the map had begun to shift away from the Palestinians and toward the Israelis. The new governments in Lebanon and Syria are not far from making their own separate agreements, and Saudi Arabia has already said that it would normalize with Tel Aviv. Trump is a 'bazaari' (marketplace) politician, one who tosses outlandish agreements in the air (for Morocco, the acceptance of its illegal occupation of Western Sahara) in utter disregard for international law. He is now doing the same with Gaza. 'I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people – the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza – to go back yet another time', he said on Air Force One. 'We don’t want Hamas going back', Trump said. 'The United States is going to own it'. It did not take long for all the UN Special Rapporteurs to sign a strong lettercondemning Trump’s comments. They made the correct argument that his idea, if implemented, is a war crime. Trump does not understand international law. He thinks like a gentrifier. This is what he has been doing across the United States: evicting ordinary people and building hideous buildings as a monument to the fabulous wealth of the few. Trump, like the illegal settlers, conducts Zionist gentrification. Silence Marwan Bardawil is an engineer with the Palestinian Water Authority. At a little-noticed press conference in Ramallah, Palestine, Bardawil said that 85% of the water and sewage facilities in the Gaza Strip were destroyed by the Israeli genocide. It will cost $1 billion to repair and replace the water and sewage facilities in Gaza. Polio, which was eradicated in Gaza a quarter of a century ago, has returned because of the collapse of the water system. The Palestinians are being silenced as the debate around Gaza unfolds. If they want a Trump International Hotel and Tower, that is up to them, not up to Trump or Netanyahu. But they are not clamouring for a golden tower. What they want are their homes. And their universities. And their hospitals. And the photographs of their family members who are now all dead.

Myanmar: Arakan Army Closing In On Capital Of Rakhine State	The rebel Arakan Army is closing in on Sittwe, the capital of Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, firing artillery on military junta outposts outside the city and preparing for an assault, residents told Radio Free Asia. Residents have been fleeing from Sittwe’s outskirts since January, but now aren’t able to escape because junta forces have blocked all exit routes, said Wai Hin Aung, an aid worker in the city. 'The blockade has led to this fighting, with the use of heavy weapons,' he said. The rebel ethnic Arakan Army, or AA, has made significant gains over the past year in its bid to root the military out of Rakhine state in its bid for self-determination. Of the 17 townships in Rakhine state, 14 are under the control of the AA, leaving only three still in the hands of the military junta – Kyaukphyu, Munaung and Sittwe, where the junta’s regional headquarters is based. Sittwe is crucial for the junta – which seized control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup d’état – not only as a source of much-needed revenue and foreign currency, but also for its role in Myanmar’s oil and gas trade via the Indian Ocean. If Sittwe falls, it would be the latest and one of the most significant defeats for the junta, which has been pushed back across the country by various ethnic armies and armed citizens who have formed militias called Peoples Defense Forces, or PDF. Junta forces have countered with artillery attacks and airstrikes on areas in Sittwe and two nearby towns where they believe that AA troops are stationed, a resident said, speaking anonymously for security reasons. Firing on naval vessels The Arakan Army also fired on junta vessels at a river naval base, a Sittwe resident told Radio Free Asia. The AA began firing at around 5 p.m., and junta fighter planes responded by dropping bombs on AA positions at about 9 p.m., he said. Several junta soldiers were wounded in the AA attack and were taken to a Sittwe hospital. 'The explosions were quite strong,' he said. 'The junta dropped about three big bombs. Then they started firing with a series of missiles.' The junta has recently reinforced its forces in and around Sittwe, and has also provided military training to thousands of Rohingya – a stateless ethnic group that predominantly follows Islam and resides in Rakhine. A Sittwe resident and military analyst from Rakhine state told RFA that neither the AA nor the military junta will easily abandon Sittwe. 'The AA is unlikely to halt its attacks on Sittwe, and the military will not abandon the city,' he said. 'That’s why intense fighting cannot be ruled out.' Rakhine State’s junta spokesperson, Hla Thein, didn’t answer his telephone when RFA tried to contact him for comment about the situation in Sittwe. AA spokesperson Khaing Thukha also didn’t immediately respond to a message left by RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwVku2CsMlKP_	2025-02-18T16:22:27-08:00	
Waste, Corruption And Foreign Meddling – And On Our ‘Nickel’ – Op...	President Donald Trump has frozen funding for the National Endowment for Democracy and proposes to shut down USAID funding. The US president’s spending cut reportedly leaves the organizations unable to pay staff and grantees. Well, it's a start anyway. In one of his first executive orders after taking office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid ($68 billion), pending a review of its alignment with US national interests. Pursuant to these orders, President Trump’s administration has frozen all funding to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). The move is said to have caused what some have called a 'bloodbath' within the organization, leaving it unable to pay staff or fulfill financial commitments. The NED, established in 1983, is officially a nonprofit organization that, ostensibly, provides grants to support democratic initiatives worldwide. However, over the years, it has faced allegations of covertly influencing political outcomes overseas, with critics arguing that it has taken over covert functions previously handled by the CIA, particularly those aimed at undermining and in some instances overthrowing foreign governments. Earlier this month, Elon Musk, who heads Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given responsibility for finding ways to cut federal spending. Musk singled out NED immediately, calling it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization' that needs to be dissolved. Since then, this organization and others have reportedly felt 'under siege' from Musk’s DOGE. 'It’s been a bloodbath,' one NED worker told the Daily Mail, explaining that the organization has been unable to meet payroll and pay basic overhead expenses. It has an allocation budget of $142 million for the current fiscal year and has already allocated $70 million for distribution to various NGOs. The NED has faced longstanding criticism over its role in supporting political movements to undermine sovereign governments. The Center for Renewing America, a research organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, released a policy paper on February 7, accusing the NED of functioning as the 'tip of the proverbial spear for heightened CIA and State Department efforts to foster political revolution in Ukraine.' The report claimed that the NED had funneled tens of millions of dollars to a myriad of Ukrainian political entities and anti-Russian interests and 'advanced both the ‘Orange Revolution’ (2004) and ‘Maidan Revolution’ (2014) that paved the way for the current Ukraine-Russia war.' The NED has also faced accusations of sponsoring 'color revolutions' in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan and of funding opposition groups in Belarus, Serbia, and Egypt. The funding freeze on the organization comes as part of broader measures by the Trump administration to cut foreign spending. Trump’s 'executive pen' has also included a crackdown on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Washington’s primary vehicle for funding political projects abroad. Trump earlier called for the agency to be shut down, claiming it is run by 'radical lunatics.' Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has formally requested that Elon Musk disclose detailed information about American grants allocated to Slovak NGOs and media outlets through Washington’s primary agency for funding political projects abroad -- USAID. In a letter to DOGE chief Musk – who previously branded USAID a 'criminal organization' – Fico voiced concerns over what he described as 'gross interference' in Slovakia’s political landscape. 'It is undeniable that funds originating from USAID were also used for political purposes in Slovakia to distort the political system and favor specific political parties,' Fico wrote in a letter shared on X on Tuesday. He urged Musk to disclose which NGOs, media outlets, and individual journalists had received US funding. Last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban similarly announced that his government would seek full transparency regarding USAID grants to NGOs and media outlets critical of his administration, emphasizing the need to 'eliminate these foreign networks' that interfere in the country’s domestic affairs. In late 2023, his government created the Sovereignty Protection Office to monitor and address the risk of political interference in the country. Foreign financing for parties or groups running for office are banned in the country, with penalties of up to three years in prison. On Tuesday evening, USAID staff received an email saying that starting Friday, 'all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership, and specially designated programs.' The email added that essential staff would be notified on Thursday afternoon and that the agency would begin moving international staff back to the US within 30 days. Data for fiscal year 2024 shows that USAID distributed nearly $32.5 billion (its entire budget) in aid that year, much of it to Africa and the Middle East. The US spends more on humanitarian aid than other countries by wide margins, though foreign aid spending is under 1% of the federal budget. The US provides some amount of aid to most countries, including nearly every country in Africa and Asia. Many polls have found a majority of Americans believe the US is spending too much on foreign aid, including for Ukraine. But here’s the thing: How much of the spending cuts will Congress (regarding the NED and USAID) permit and which cuts will federal courts rule exceed President Trump’s authority? This is a drama that will surely play out in the midst of Trump 'taking Gaza,' the Ukraine proxy war with Russia and the global array of punitive tariffs orchestrated between the US, Canada, Mexico, China and the EU – so far.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PweoS0YcuoUPp	2025-02-18T16:15:16-08:00	
In Southern Thailand, Vintage US Items Drive Market Boom For Used...	By Asmadee Bueheng Piya Dueramae makes a living selling secondhand clothes, and spends much of his time hunting for rare finds in markets across Thailand’s Deep South. The 43-year-old’s connection to the business runs deep – his parents introduced secondhand markets to him when was a child. 'In Yala, we grew up going to the Maprao Market for clothes,' Piya told BenarNews, referring to a popular used-clothes market in Yala province. 'While city kids shopped in malls, our parents took us to secondhand markets. It became a way of life, a culture.' Used clothes shipped in from the United States – such as blue jeans and t-shirts featuring Marvel Comics’ action heroes – are among the 'treasures' that can be found among piles of old apparel at secondhand markets in the Deep South. The mainly Malay Muslim border region is more known for a long-running separatist insurgency than its booming secondhand clothing market. But used clothing is deeply ingrained in the local culture. By buying secondhand clothes, people with low incomes in this economically underdeveloped region could afford popular brand name apparel. The secondhand markets in southern Thailand grew bigger with the global trend of vintage clothing gaining popularity, as these markets became well-known for the rare items they sold. 'The beginning of second-hand clothing sales in the southern border areas started in 1973, when villagers from Yaring district, Pattani, who worked on fishing boats in Malaysia, brought second-hand clothes and goods from Malaysia back to sell at home,' Thitaree Srisurat, editor of the Rusamilae Journal at Prince of Songkla University in Pattani, another province in the Deep South, wrote in a 2021 article. 'It gained popularity, and many families took it up as a business, with about 20% of the community working in second-hand clothing sales. Some families still continue this to this day.' The main factor is affordability. 'People here cannot afford expensive goods, and since these are second-hand clothes, they don’t feel bad about wearing them to work in the fields,' Thitaree said. Soliha Ayohsae, a veteran secondhand clothing vendor, switched from running a regular clothing store in Bangkok to selling used clothes in southern Thailand because of the higher demand in the region. 'It’s easier and faster to sell here than in Bangkok because it’s cheaper. I used to sell in Bangkok, and although the profit per item was higher, the sales were fewer. Here, people buy a lot and often. Since it’s second-hand, they can easily replace it without feeling guilty,' Soliha told BenarNews. 'People here prefer secondhand because they are branded, high-quality, and affordable…. The demand has always been strong.' The secondhand fashion industry has witnessed explosive growth worldwide. According to ThredUp, a United States-based resale marketplace, secondhand clothes’ share of the total global apparel in 2025 is expected to be 10%, or U.S. $246 billion. This used clothes market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 12% between 2024 and 2027, reaching an estimated value of $350 billion by 2027, with Asia expected to account for 41%. Thailand’s secondhand market is expanding alongside. The Thai secondhand fashion market in 2023 was valued at 1.8 billion baht ($53.4 million), reflecting a 20% growth from the previous year, according to a report by SCB Economic Intelligence Center. It is expected to continue growing at a rate of 15% annually through 2027. However, no studies have specifically examined the market in Thailand’s Deep South, where buying used clothes has been the norm for decades. Data for 2024 was not available. Secondhand clothing in southern Thailand is mostly available in key markets like Yala’s Maprao Market, and Pattani’s Rusamilae and Yaring markets. A diverse clientele shops at these places including locals and collectors, seeking vintage American apparel, such as blue jeans. ‘Discarded in America but are treasures here’ Most of the secondhand clothing available in Thailand comes from the U.S. via Malaysia. The clothing is transported from America to Malaysia via cargo ships. Foreign vendors in Thailand then purchase some of these clothes to resell in their countries. Soliha, the veteran secondhand clothing seller from Maprao Market, said secondhand American apparel was in high demand. 'These were once discarded in America but are treasures here. People buy them for work, farming, the office, and even as fashion. The quality is good, the price is low, and vintage never goes out of style,' she said. 'Maprao Market is a shopping paradise. We get shoppers from Malaysia’s border areas, Pakistan,and Western tourists also shop here. I make over 100,000 baht [$2,966] a month.' A single bale of secondhand clothing imported from Malaysia, which could consist of 200-220 T-shirts or 150-180 jackets or trousers, costs around 1,000 baht ($29.6). At Maprao Market these clothes could then sell for anything from 5 baht (U.S. 14 cents) an item to tens of thousands of baht per item, depending on their rarity and brand. The popularity of secondhand clothing has led to eye-catching sale prices at auctions. For instance, a vintage (1997) T-shirt featuring Marvel Comics’ characters Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer from Maprao Market sold for 220,000 baht ($6,526) in an online auction. 'Collectors from Japan, in particular, love U.S. made T-shirts, especially ones made of thin cotton fabrics, and [music] band T-shirts,' he said. Piya, the Yala vendor, said he bought a vintage T-shirt from the 1970s from Maprao Market for 80 baht ($2.37) and sold it for 22,000 baht ($654) in the same market. Secondhand military apparel, workwear, denim, jerseys and Hawaiian shirts also fetch high prices. Military garments from World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam wars are considered especially valuable, particularly if they feature unit-specific prints. Lately, unofficial band merchandise, which is usually sold outside concert venues, is becoming trendy as well. 'Some of these items sell for over 100,000 baht ($2,800) each, more than what official band merchandise sells for,' Piya said. 'You have to know what’s valuable and what’s not.' Competition is rising, though, with a growth in demand. Some vendors buy high-value pieces from southern markers to resell them in Bangkok. More are being filtered before they reach Thailand, as the popularity of vintage clothing has risen. And more Japanese collectors too are traveling to Thailand to hand-pick rare finds. As demand grows, sellers must continuously expand their knowledge to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized market, vendors said. For vendors in southern Thailand secondhand clothing is about more than just fashion or a hobby – it’s a livelihood. 'This business is not just a passion anymore; it supports our families and our children’s education,' Piya said. 'We have to adapt. The secondhand market is changing fast, and only those who learn and evolve will survive.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwVEdSd4og-sX	2025-02-18T16:11:32-08:00	
Spyware As A Service: Challenges In Applying Export Controls To C...	By Kolja Brockmann and Lauriane Héau For all their legitimate law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering uses, cyber-surveillance tools are prone to abuse. Among other things, they can be used by states to target political opponents or to oppress certain ethnic or religious groups, or to steal an adversary’s data or attack critical infrastructure. States have increasingly sought to use export controls to help prevent transfers of cyber-surveillance tools, including software, that could enable human rights violations or pose a threat to national security. Controls covering transfers of cybersurveillance hardware, software and technology have been introduced through the Wassenaar Arrangement, the European Union and national control lists and by way of a catch-all control in the EU dual-use regulation. However, the growing use of the ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) model—in which a software application is hosted and used on a cloud server but not downloaded by the end-user—poses a particular set of challenges. States differ in how they apply export controls to cloud computing, including SaaS, and their interpretation of relevant legal provisions informs their application of licensing requirements and enforcement measures. This divergence opens potential loopholes and gaps that could be exploited for illicit procurement. It also creates a confusing landscape for companies that want to remain in compliance with the controls on cyber-surveillance tools and other software. This blog aims to highlight the export control compliance and enforcement challenges posed by SaaS and offers some thoughts on how states can close these gaps and achieve more effective oversight of the trade in cyber-surveillance tools. The software as a service model and cyber-surveillance products SaaS is a type of cloud computing in which the software is uploaded to a cloud server—which could be owned and operated by the software provider or by a separate cloud service provider—and made available for use without the end-user being able to download the software to a local device or storage medium. Familiar examples of SaaS include cloud-based collaborative work and e-mail solutions or design and engineering tools that are available directly via the internet without the need for download. One type of cyber-surveillance tool that may be offered via the SaaS model is intrusion software. Controls on intrusion software were added to the dual-use control list of the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013 and apply to software ‘specially designed or modified to avoid detection by 'monitoring tools', or to defeat 'protective countermeasures', of a computer or network-capable device’ in order to remotely extract or modify data and, in some cases, take control of the device. Some companies also offer facial recognition software via the SaaS model. This may, under certain conditions, be subject to control in EU member states by way of the EU dual-use regulation catch-all control for unlisted cyber-surveillance items or potentially via national control lists. In July 2024 the United States also proposed adding facial recognition software to its national dual-use control list. Challenges for export controls if cyber-surveillance tools are offered via the SaaS model When software is made available through the SaaS model, there are three main actors: the software provider, the cloud service provider (who may also be the software provider) and the recipient end-user of the software (see figure below). There are several actions in this model that may constitute an export. First, the software provider uploads the software to a cloud server, which may be owned by the software provider or by a separate cloud service provider. Second, once it is on the server, the party controlling access to the software (usually the software provider) grants access to the recipient, thus making the software available. Third, the cloud service provider may also (at least potentially) grant access to the software for maintenance purposes. And finally, the recipient end-user downloads the data gathered using the software. To determine whether any of these actions constitutes an export and who would be considered the exporter, an export licensing authority may need to establish a number of things, including the locations of the server and the three actors; who had effective control over granting access to the software during each of these steps; and whether the software was made available to the cloud service provider, the end-user or both. Screenshot Key differences in states’ interpretations of controls on SaaS States’ interpretations differ on some key points: whether making controlled software available through SaaS is considered an export; and if it is considered an export, who is the exporter and which parts of the transaction trigger licensing requirements. These differences are found even within the EU, where member states share a common regulation for dual-use export controls. Some states appear not to have settled on a consistent national interpretation thus far. As well as creating potential loopholes and gaps, this divergence makes compliance more difficult, particularly for companies that operate in several states with different interpretations. For example, according to guidance published by the German export licensing authority, BAFA, the cloud server being located in a state outside the EU is sufficient to trigger a licensing requirement for uploading controlled software. Granting access and thereby making the controlled software available to a user in a third country may also constitute an instance of export or brokering and therefore trigger a separate licensing requirement. Other states, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom focus instead on the location of the person or entity accessing the software—rather than the location of the server—when determining whether it is a controlled export. The United States has indicated that granting or gaining access to controlled software via SaaS does not constitute an export per se if the software provider uses a certain industry-standard level of end-to-end encryption that prevents the cloud service provider or any of its agents (for example those performing maintenance on the server infrastructure) from accessing the software. However, this only applies if the software is unclassified and neither destined for a recipient that is a party of concern on the entity list—a tool used by the USA to list foreign persons and companies to which specific restrictions or licensing requirements apply—nor stored on a server in a country under an arms embargo. What the different interpretations mean for oversight, controllability and enforcement Different interpretations of key concepts, including ‘export’ and ‘exporter’, determine the level of oversight and the ability to impose controls and—where necessary—prohibit transfers using export control legislation. States need to consider whether their current legal interpretations and provisions regarding making software available through SaaS satisfies their need for oversight, including for sensitive transactions involving cyber-surveillance software. Whether their desired level of oversight is reached also depends on whether they have complementary legal measures other than export controls at their disposal that enable oversight or provide means of intervention. However states frame their export controls, they need to think about how to enforce the controls, which requires having the appropriate capacities to respond when they suspect that unlicensed transfers have taken place or are imminent. There are also practical detection and enforcement challenges that make it difficult for states to claim jurisdiction and to collect the evidence required for establishing intent, who had effective control over granting access and whether controlled software was made available to a specific end-user. Some states, including the USA, require a certain level of encryption to be applied for transfers of controlled software instead of a licensing requirement—an approach that is favoured by industry actors. However, relying only on the use of encryption could mean less attention is paid to the end-users and end-uses. It could also risk creating additional hurdles for enforcement investigations, particularly if states do not have the required digital forensics capabilities available to retrieve required information and retrace transfers and access. Striking the right balance The use of cloud computing and the provision of software via SaaS are both set to increase. As with all dual-use export controls, states need to find the right balance between ensuring regulatory control over potentially risky cyber-surveillance exports and limiting the burden on legitimate trade. Industry representatives have called for harmonization across states in how export controls apply to software in order to facilitate compliance. This currently appears unlikely to happen, even in the EU, given states’ continued disagreement on key aspects of how controls apply. However, states should clarify their national interpretations concerning how export controls apply to cloud computing, including SaaS, and provide guidance and conduct outreach to companies to support their compliance efforts. At the EU level, the current process of drafting common guidelines on intangible transfers of technology provides a welcome opportunity to do this. It is not yet well known how and to what extent companies are offering different types of cyber-surveillance tools via SaaS. National authorities should thus engage regularly with both domestic and multinational companies to stay on top of this development and ensure that their legal interpretations and enforcement capabilities are appropriate for controlling the trade in cyber-surveillance software. More exchange between states’ licensing authorities and enforcement agencies on the detection, investigation and prosecution of cases involving SaaS could also be useful to this end. One way this could be achieved is through broader multilateral initiatives—such as the ‘Pall Mall Process’—that seek to regulate the trade in cyber-surveillance tools and could improve understanding of both the technical aspects of the trade in these tools and how export controls can complement other regulatory mechanisms. Considering the threat that cyber-surveillance tools may pose to civic freedoms, open societies should strive to ensure, despite the technical and legal difficulties, that cyber-surveillance tools do not fall into the hands of actors who seek to misuse them.

Purchasing Power And The International Demand For Dollars – Analy...	By Frank Shostak Often various factors are perceived to be important in determining a currency rate of exchange. For instance, for some commentators an increase in the government foreign debt is regarded as pointing to a likely deterioration in economic fundamentals ahead. This provides the rationale for the selling of the currency of concern. For many economists, the state of the balance of trade is a key factor in the currency exchange rate determination. On this way of thinking, all other things being equal, an increase in imports, which leads to a trade deficit, causes an increase in the demand for foreign currency. To obtain the foreign currency, importers sell the domestic currency for it. As a result, this causes a strengthening in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the domestic currency (i.e., more domestic money is sold per unit of a foreign currency). Conversely, all other things being equal, an increase in exports leads to a trade surplus. Once exporters exchange their foreign currency earnings for domestic money, this leads to a strengthening in the domestic money exchange rate against the foreign money (i.e., more foreign money is sold per unit of domestic money). Alternatively, consider the case when the central bank tightens its interest rate stance. The increase in the domestic interest rate, all other things being equal, attracts foreigners’ demand for domestic money. The holders of the foreign currency are now exchanging it for the domestic currency which is going to be placed in the domestic currency deposits in order to earn higher interest rates. Consequently, this lifts the price of the local currency in terms of foreign currency. It would appear that various factors such as the government debt, the interest rate differential, the state of the economy, and the balance of trade are important factors in the currency exchange rate determination. We can also add to these various psychological factors that would appear to be important in the currency exchange rate determination. Thus, a change in individuals’ perceptions regarding the state of the economy is likely to influence the currency rate of exchange. Rather than focusing on these many factors, it would make more sense to identify the key or the essential factor that determines the currency rate of exchange, that is, to identify the essence that dictates the currency rate of exchange determination. The Relative Purchasing Power of Money (PPM): The Essence of the Exchange Rate The essence of the currency exchange rate is the relative purchasing power of various monies. In a non-monetary barter economy, the 'price' of goods has to do with what trades individuals are willing to make in terms of units of goods or services (e.g., 100 apples might be exchanged for shoes). A price of a good, in monetary terms, is the amount of money exchanged for it. The 'price' of money is determined in what units of goods and services will be exchanged for it. We can also say that the amount of money exchanged for goods is the purchasing power of money (PPM) with respect to goods and services. If, in the US, the price of a good is one dollar and in the Eurozone an identical good is sold for two euros, then the rate of exchange between the US dollar and the euro is likely to be two euros per one dollar. An important factor in setting the purchasing power of money is the supply of money. Now, let us say that, over time, the growth rate in the US money supply exceeds the growth rate of European money supply, all other things being equal. Since a price of a good is the amount of money per good, this now means that the prices of goods in dollar terms will increase faster than prices in euro terms, all other things being equal. As a result, an identical good is priced now, for example, at two dollars against the one dollar previously, while in the Eurozone, 2.5 euros against 2 euros previously. This would imply that the exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro should be now 1.25 euros per one dollar and not 2 euros per one dollar. Another important factor in driving the purchasing power of various moneys and the exchange rate is a change in the demand for money. For instance, with an increase in the production of goods, the demand for money is likely to follow suit. The demand for the services of the medium of exchange is likely to increase since more goods are now going to be exchanged. As a result, for a given supply of money, the purchasing power of money will increase, all other things being equal. Less money will be chasing more goods now. Arbitrage Any deviation of the exchange rate from the rate implied by the relative purchasing power of money is likely to generate profit opportunities, which tends to undo the deviation. For instance, the deviation could emerge because of the market response to the trade account data or because of a change in the interest rate differential in the domestic economy versus other economies. Such deviations are likely to open profit opportunities for entrepreneurs. This rearranges the market toward the elimination of the underpricing. However, let us say that the Fed raises its policy interest rate while the European central bank (ECB) keeps its policy rate unchanged. If the price of a good in the US is one dollar and in the Eurozone the price of an identical good is two euros, then, according to the purchasing power framework, the currency rate of exchange should be one dollar for two euros. Because of a widening in the interest rate differential between the US and the Eurozone, an increase in the demand for dollars pushes the exchange rate in the market towards one dollar for three euros. (The holders of the euros are now exchanging more euros for dollars that are going to be placed in the dollar deposits in order to earn higher interest rates). The dollar is now overvalued versus the exchange rate as implied by the relative purchasing power of the dollar versus the euro. (It should be two euros to one dollar and not three euros to one dollar). In this situation, it will pay to sell goods for dollars, exchange dollars for euros, and then buy the goods with euros, thus making an arbitrage gain. For example, individuals could sell a good for one dollar, exchange the one dollar for three euros, and then exchange three euros for 1.5 units of the good, gaining an extra 0.5 of a good. The fact that the holders of dollars increased their demand for euros in order to profit from the arbitrage is going to make euros more expensive in terms of dollars (i.e., more dollars per euro, pushing the exchange rate in the direction of one dollar for two euros). Arbitrage is set in motion once the rate of exchange deviates—for whatever reasons—from the rate of exchange as dictated by the relative purchasing power of monies. Conclusion The key factor in the currency exchange rate determination is the relative purchasing power of various monies. If, for whatever reasons, the market currency exchange rate deviates from the exchange rate as implied by the relative purchasing power of various monies this activates an arbitrage, which works towards the convergence of the exchange rate towards the relative purchasing power of monies.

Can Australia Stay Resilient In An Unpredictable 2025? – Analysis	By Melissa Conley Tyler and Viet Dung Trinh After a positive 2024 in which Australia successfully encouraged China to reverse remaining trade restrictions, everyone expects 2025 to be a difficult year for Australia’s economy. Leading economists have predicted that the most likely impacts of US President Donald Trump’s second administration on Australia will be negative, including slower progress to net zero emissions, higher US inflation and weaker Chinese economic growth. How is Australia positioned to cope with what 2025 might throw at it? The current state of Australia’s economic statecraft is illustrated by two developments at the end of 2024. The Australian Parliament passed the ‘Future Made in Australia’ Act, setting out industry policy to build competitive new industries for the clean energy economy. At the same time, Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also launched the ‘Trading Nation’ report on how open trade and investment contribute to Australians’ prosperity. These developments show a country trying to walk a fine line between intervention and openness. For Australia, more active government involvement in markets through the Future Made in Australia plan is a significant ideological departure from the recent past. With a global retreat from open economics and a reemergence of nationalist approaches to trade, countries like Australia have had to adapt. As Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers noted, ‘it would be preposterously self-defeating to leave our policies unchanged in the face of all this industry policy taking shape and taking hold around us’. Australia is responding to these geostrategic forces by competing with industry incentives offered by other countries, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Canada and the European Union to nurture the development of new industries. A Future Made in Australia is investing AU$22.7 billion (US$14.3 billion) into Australia’s workforce, renewable energy, supporting investment in Australia, technological and industrial renovation and utilisation of natural resources and critical minerals. It aims to produce more goods domestically, creating more job opportunities for Australians. In contrast, the Trading Nation report emphasises the role of free and open trade in Australia’s prosperity. Around 31 per cent of Australian economic output is supported by trade activity and one in every four jobs are linked to trade. Global trade regulation, such as through the World Trade Organization, is described as one of the pillars of Australians’ prosperity, supporting the stability of the trading environment and providing Australian exporters with access to markets. Australia’s 18 bilateral and regional free trade agreements on average boost trade by 13 per cent and covered around 78 per cent of Australia’s two-way goods and services trade as of 2022. New, creative accords like the Singapore–Australia Green Economy Agreement encourage trade, open business opportunities and facilitate investment in industries that promote the net zero transition. The report also makes the case for foreign investment to facilitate access to more capital and investment, with Australia’s openness to foreign investment contributing to the country’s development, job creation and improvement of living standards. Sectors like banking, energy, infrastructure, resources and agriculture — essential to achieving the goal of net zero — are largely dependent on foreign investment. Placed side-by-side, the two reports illustrate a country trying to find a balance between different imperatives. This is in line with a report by the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy & Defence Dialogue (AP4D), which argued that it is in Australia’s interests to promote a transparent, predictable and rules-based global trading system alongside industry measures. This is an important message to keep in focus in 2025 with the likelihood of another US–China trade war and tit-for-tat protectionism in response to US tariffs. It is worth remembering that an open global trading system is a vital counter to attempted economic coercion, allowing targeted industries to seek out alternative markets. Following China’s 2020 trade restrictions, Australia’s ability to withstand China’s economic coercion by redirecting targeted commodities was a factor in Beijing deciding to reverse remaining trade restrictions. During the period of attempted economic coercion, there were advocates focused on ‘friendshoring’ — selling more to countries perceived as allies and friends, particularly collaborating on supply chains and foreign investment. But this can be difficult and expensive, working against economic logic. Diversification is better achieved by agnostically increasing the number of markets, reducing the risk of disruption in any one market. It is also important for Australia to keep sight of the importance of the global economic system and its significant role within it. Australia has actively supported and played a leading role in the creation of global rules that underpin the rise of global trade, even being one of the founding members of the World Trade Organization. Particularly during the second Trump administration, Australia should focus on cooperating with like-minded states to ‘save the furniture’ of the global trading system. Despite the challenges that 2025 will bring, Australia’s economic statecraft cannot focus only on domestic industry policy — it must also promote open trade and investment. In an unpredictable global economic environment, Australia’s policy responses need to continue to strike the right balance. This means that in 2025, Australia needs to continue its approach of supporting the global trading system alongside industry measures.

China’s LAC Infrastructure In Xinjiang: A Colonial Perspective – ...	By Ayjaz Wani In a tactical move to reduce the travel time between northern and southern Xinjiang from seven hours to three hours while protecting goods from harsh winter conditions, China completed excavating the world’s longest roadway tunnel in the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang in December 2024. The 22.13 km tunnel, set to open in 2025, is crucial to China’s ambitious 319.72 km Urumqi-Yuli Expressway. Around the same time, China’s Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and State Council approved the creation of two new counties, He’an and Hekang, in the Aksai Chin region of India, which was unlawfully ceded to China by Pakistan through a border agreement in 1963. The illegal creation of new counties in the Aksai Chin region, close on the heels of the recent rapprochement with India, shows Beijing's colonial mentality, adding to the complexities of Sino-India bilateral relations. The new counties managed by Khotan prefecture and the establishment of counties in the uninhabited region close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) represent an effort aimed at building infrastructure and increasing the Han population along the border, reminiscent of actions taken during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. However, China has maintained that the tunnel will enhance connectivity and support the socio-economic development of southern regions predominantly inhabited by Uyghurs, thus strengthening unity among ethnicities. China’s Xinjiang border policy post-1949 Xinjiang’s history is marked by conflicts over its autonomy and independence. Chinese imperial rule lasted only 400 years, until 1949. In 1720, the Qing dynasty extended its control into the area for the first time since the Tang dynasty, but sustaining authority was challenging. This historical context is crucial to understanding China's current Xinjiang border policy. After 1760, Qing leaders began relocating Han criminals from the mainland to Xinjiang, providing them subsidies and loans to settle and farm. After 1950, Beijing initiated the mass migration of the Han people to the province to leverage its natural resources, establish political dominance, and integrate the local population into Chinese culture. Following 1949, this migration aimed to exploit resources and safeguard the frontier from external influences, particularly those of the erstwhile Soviet Union. Following 1958, 60,000 Kazaks moved to the former Soviet Central Asian Republics. Beijing responded by sealing the border and forcibly relocating thousands of non-Han families from the border area, replacing them with Han citizens. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), established in 1954, facilitated all these population transfers. Comprising primarily of demobilised troops, XPCC functions as an economic enterprise and military force, wielding considerable governmental authority that impacts the region’s socio-political and financial dynamics. The organisation aimed to relocate Han individuals outside existing cities by establishing colonies, promoting the slogan of ‘transforming nature and reforming man’ to reclaim land, build industries, explore natural resources, and construct strategic roads and railway lines. XPCC assisted Beijing in extracting oil and gas from Xinjiang. Estimates indicate the region has 23.4 billion tonnes of oil reserves and 13 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves. The XPCC constructed the Xinjiang-Xizang highway through Aksai Chin. By 1958, over 6,000 miles of roads had been built. The highway network expanded from 17,830 km in 2015 to 20,920 km in 2020. After 2021, Beijing commenced the construction of new roads towards the LAC from the G219 highway, which runs along the border. Beijing has prioritised building strategic roads and highways in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) to upgrade the LAC infrastructure in Tibet and Xinjiang. Similarly, China is also constructing the rail networks in Xinjiang, which have expanded from 5,900 km in 2015 to approximately 7,800 km in 2020. Colonial rationale behind the new counties and infrastructure Most Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang reside in the southern regions, particularly in Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, and Kurla, where they have managed to resist the Chinese Communist Party's enforced sinicisation, a process of assimilating non-Chinese communities into Chinese culture. Beijing’s growing security and economic interests in neighbouring Central and South Asia and concerns about potential unrest within southern Xinjiang have forced China to create new counties and increase its push for infrastructure. Despite its draconian policies in Xinjiang, Beijing is increasingly concerned about the rising security dilemmas along the Pakistan border, making enhancing security measures there and along Uyghur-dominated regions a priority. The new Han migrants are mostly retired army personnel and work as a security force wielding administrative powers. Additionally, due to the rising demand for lithium and the estimated presence of 2 million tons of lithium in the vicinity of these new counties, XPCC intends to promote mining in the area. The Tianshan Shengli Tunnel will enhance Xinjiang’s connectivity and boost Chinese trade and commerce with Central Asia, especially after the completion of the China- Kyrgyzstan- Uzbekistan railway line. Enhanced connectivity will attract more Chinese companies and further integrate the south of Xinjiang with Eurasian nations under the Belt and Road Initiative. Similarly, establishing two new counties in the parts of the Aksai Chin region of India will facilitate the transfer of Han migrants to the area through XPCC to develop new infrastructure and logistics to support the Chinese army in the region, which will have geostrategic implications along the LAC for India. India’s response After 1991, China capitalised on Central Asia's economic and political instability to extend its influence into the tumultuous Xinjiang region. Beijing exploited the economic and political upheaval in the Central Asian countries bordering Xinjiang, securing 22 per cent, 32 per cent, and 3.5 per cent of land claimed from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, respectively. Beijing tried the same towards India after 2020, which heightened tensions along the LAC and increased standoffs. Unlike other neighbouring countries in restive Xinjiang, New Delhi has intensified its infrastructure initiatives in Kashmir and Ladakh. It has built the impressive Chenab Bridge, recognised as the tallest cable-stayed bridge in the world, alongside the 12.77 km T49 rail tunnel. Additionally, the ongoing construction of the 13.5 km Zojila Tunnel showcases India’s exceptional engineering feats and strategic edge over its rivals. Since 2019, India’s Prime Minister has personally overseen many of these geoeconomic and geostrategic projects. On 13 January 2025, the Prime Minister formally opened the Z-Mohr tunnel on the critical Srinagar-Leh highway. The Zojila Tunnel is anticipated to be finished by 2026, further boosting New Delhi's strategic influence in Eastern Ladakh and along the LAC. India has also expanded its road and bridge infrastructure along the LAC in Ladakh. In 2021, 87 bridges were completed, while in 2022, the Defence Minister inaugurated projects costing INR 2,180 crores, including 18 solely dedicated to Ladakh. Following the successful rail connection with Kashmir, New Delhi should prioritise the 489 km Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway line to swiftly deploy forces and equipment along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh. To maintain its pace and strategic advantage over Beijing along the LAC, India requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes expedited infrastructure development, enhanced defence capabilities, and collaborative international efforts with allied nations to counter Chinese deceptive tactics.

Kadyrov’s Efforts To Create Chechen Muftiate In Ingushetia Threat...	Chechnya’s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has never made his hopes a secret to absorb Ingushetia (a neighboring republic within the Russian Federation) and perhaps portions of Dagestan into his republic, both of which were part of the Chechen-Ingush republic in the past (see EDM, September 27, 2018, February 28, 2023). In 2019, he compelled Magas to hand over 10 percent of Ingushetia to his control (see EDM, December 1, 2021). More recently, Kadyrov has supported the Batal-Haji Sufi order in Ingushetia, a group that is now in open conflict not only with Magas but Moscow as well (Fortanga.org, November 4, 2022; Window on Eurasia, December 8, 2022, January 28; see EDM, January 24, 2023). Now, Kadyrov has launched an indirect effort to subordinate Ingushetia to himself and his republic through the use of Islam (see EDM, March 24, 2022). According to the independent Fortanga news agency, he has organized meetings in Cairo with Ingush Muslims to create a new muftiate for Ingushetia that will supervise Muslim parishes there, giving him yet another basis for exercising leverage over the government in Magas as well (Fortanga, January 31). On January 31, Fortanga reported, based on conversations with two informed sources, that Chechnya’s mufti, Salakh Mehiyev, with Kadyrov’s backing, began talks in Cairo with a group of instructors of the Ingush Islamic University about the possibility of forming a new muftiate in Ingushetia (Ibid). Many federal subjects of the Russian Federation have more than one such organization, also known as Muslim spiritual directorates (MSDs). The Chechen-backed move, however, appears intended not to become yet another of these institutions there but rather to replace the existing MSD with a Chechen-controlled one, something Fortanga suggests has the support of some in the Magas government (Ibid). According to one of Fortanga’s sources, participants in the talks have the support of Salakh Mezhiev, the chairman of the coordination center of Muslims of the North Caucasus Federal District, and Adam Shakhidov, an advisor to Kadyrov. Moreover, this source claims, 'Mahmud-Ali Kalimatov [head of the Ingush Republic] is also aware of the plans. Representatives of the local clergy carry out consultations on further actions between the heads of the two regions. [But] participants in the process are afraid of leaks and public discontent and act as quietly as possible' (Fortanga, January 31). This is an indication of just how explosive such a development could be. Another sign of the sensitivity of these talks is how the most recent round occurred not in Magas or Grozny but in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. According to Fortanga’s second source, Grozny officials decided on this radical step after failing in their earlier efforts to win over Isa Khamkhoyev, the former mufti of Ingushetia (Ibid). Earlier, Chechen officials tried to win over the head of Ingushetia MSD. That failure highlights what is likely to be widespread opposition among Muslims in Ingushetia to what the Chechens are trying to do, however much money Grozny may be willing to spend and however much support those who go along with the Chechens may receive from Kalimatov. In Fortanga’s words, all this clearly indicates that 'the goals being pursued by Ingushetia’s neighbor are power and the creation of their own team, which will give them influence over the republic and its internal processes' (Fortanga, January 31). Three aspects of this development make it far more significant than it might appear at first glance. First, the Chechen effort to create a new MSD in Ingushetia may very well succeed, at least initially, because the Ingush governor has long had a troubled relationship with the republic muftiate and now appears ready to work with the Chechens (APN.ru, November 26, 2021). Thiswill reduce the authority of the current governor and may even lead to a new round of protests against him if a new muftiate is created or even if Ingush residents become aware that Kalimatov is working with the Chechens. Many Ingush residents will likely view this as an act of betrayal, just as they viewed signing of an accord in 2019 by Kalimatov’s predecessor Yunus-Bek Yevkurov which transferred 10 percent of the smallest non-Russian republic to Chechen control when he (see EDM, September 27, 2018, April 9, 2019). The accord sparked the largest protests in Ingush history, with tens of thousands taking to the streets and numerous arrests, trials, and imprisonments that have lasted in some cases until now (Window on Eurasia, October 11, 2021, December 7, 2024). Second, the border issue in Ingushetia is heating up again. On the one hand, members of the Ingush Seven, as the leaders of the protest became known, are now being released from prison. The Ingush are welcoming them as heroes, but some Russian officials want them to be drafted and sent to fight and possibly die in Ukraine, suggestions that have outraged many in Ingushetia (Fortanga.org, February 5). On the other hand, Moscow officials have expressed support for further changing the border between Ingushetia and Chechnya in Grozny’s favor (Fortanga.org, December 11, 12, 2024). Many Ingush will view talk of a Chechnya-controlled muftiate in their republic through these optics, and some may decide that they need to take to the streets again lest their republic be further reduced to a shadow of its former self, something that is more likely if news of Chechnya’s role in creating a new muftiate spreads. One activist responded that Grozny will not stop until it controls all of the Ingush Republic (Fortanga.org, December 18, 2024). Third, Grozny’s move to create a muftiate in Ingushetia that Chechnya controls is going to echo across the North Caucasus, especially in Dagestan, where Kadyrov has also made territorial claims. The meeting of any of them in Dagestan would likely trigger more violence in what is rapidly becoming the most unstable republic in the Russian Federation (Window on Eurasia, March 13, October 12, 20, 2024; Kavkaz Uzel, August 12, 2024). The danger that what Kadyrov is doing will destabilize the North Caucasus more generally may cause Moscow to try to prevent Kadyrov from taking action on a new Ingush muftiate. In the past, however, the Kremlin has often found it hard to rein in the Chechen leader given his ability so far to keep Chechnya quiet and provide support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda. Both the dangers of more destabilization in the North Caucasus more generally, as well as the radicalization of Islam among Chechens in the Republic of Georgia and the revival of secular Chechen nationalism in the emigration and among Chechens fighting against Moscow in Ukraine, may lead some in Moscow to conclude that they need to rein in Kadyrov, despite the risks that any such moves would have (Window on Eurasia, January 24, February 12). Consequently, what might appear to some as a minor administrative shift in the governance of the Muslims of Ingushetia could have enormous consequences not only in the North Caucasus but in Moscow as well.

From Tariffs To Turmoil: Trump’s Protectionist Playbook – Analysi...	US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports on February 10, doubling down on his protectionist agenda to 'boost' the U.S. economy through import taxes, a move that could disrupt trade with key partners. Set to take effect on March 4, the tariffs will impact the 25 million tons of steel the U.S. imports annually. This follows a White House decision to delay tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest steel exporters alongside Brazil and South Korea. The move marks another step in Trump’s aggressive trade policy, coming just days after the administration imposed a sweeping 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, escalating tensions with global trade partners. The policy enforces tariffs 'without exceptions or exemptions,' ending carve-outs previously granted to certain nations and raising aluminum duty rates. This mirrors Trump’s 2018 tariffs during his first term, which triggered global retaliation. By rejecting multilateral trade norms, the move risks escalating trade disputes while prioritizing economic nationalism over diplomatic engagement, despite warnings of market disruptions and strained international relations. Trump has also hinted at reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing duties on U.S. imports, though specifics on exemptions or targeted nations remain unclear: 'If they charge us, we charge them.' Given that Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea are major steel and aluminum sources, the policy may worsen critical trade ties and increase international trade tensions. Fears of a perfect storm in world trade have already been triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of wide-ranging tariffs on products from Mexico, Canada, and China. Enacting executive authority to tackle the 'major threat' of illegal immigration and drug trafficking—including fentanyl—Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico as well as 10 percent on Chinese imports. Additionally, he promised trade restrictions on European goods and intends to introduce 'reciprocal tariffs' on other nations very soon. Historically, Trump has always argued that focusing on countries having trade surpluses against the United States would boost the American economy and has even mentioned tariffs as a possible substitute for an income tax. Once again Trump has supported a protectionist economic plan despite acknowledging their potential economic damage on the United States and calling it a required price. America’s three biggest trading partners—China, Mexico and Canada—reacted immediately. While China imposed countermeasures aimed at U.S. exports including crude oil, LPG, and farm machinery, Canada and Mexico reacted with punitive tariffs. Beijing has also started a Google antitrust investigation and threatened to bring suit against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Investors in Asia and Europe are preparing themselves for the consequences of an escalating trade conflict. The interruption of global supply networks, increased stock market volatility, and worries of lasting financial instability highlight the wide-ranging effects of Trump’s tariff-based approach on the international economic system. Far from providing the unilateral advantages he contends, Trump’s tariff war will exact a great cost on the American economy. Given that rising business expenses are passed on to consumers, the most immediate outcome would be accelerated inflation, which provides a sharp contrast to Trump’s pledge to control rising costs. Greater tariffs will interrupt global supply chains, stifling growth and investment, lowering borrowing costs, and even hurting U.S. exports. The measures are predicted to hit particularly hard leading industries such as agriculture and the car sector. Should Trump expand this tariff conflict to Europe, the financial consequences for the United States would amplify, lowering growth and aggravating internal issues. Far from what Trump claims, the expenses of this protectionist approach more than exceed any potential advantages. History shows clearly how Trump’s trade initiatives have faltered. Under the pretense of lowering the U.S. trade deficit, he started a trade war with China during his first term by means of $400 billion in tariffs. Six years later—even as President Biden continued with this protectionism—the deficit has hardly shifted. Indeed, this trade war has never really been about the deficit. Rather, it is part of a general U.S. policy to restrain the ascent of China. Trade restrictions and attempts to limit China’s access to sophisticated technologies, notably semiconductors and AI development, have been part of this plan. The United States has been trying everything to slow down China’s economic rise. The attempt to contain the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek for it not only showcases China’s resilience but also reveals the weaknesses of American attempts to block its technological and economic advancement. The ultimate outcomes of Trump’s tariff policies remain uncertain, but one consequence is undeniable: the United States is steadily dismantling the rule-based international order established after World War II, a system anchored in free trade and globalization. By withdrawing from international treaties and organizations and doubling down on protectionism, the United States is undermining the very framework that has sustained global stability. This shift risks creating greater chaos and instability at both global and regional levels. Moreover, a transactional approach to trade wars alienates allies and fails to significantly curb China’s rise, while simultaneously destabilizing the global economic order. In pursuing short-term gains, the United States risks long-term damage to its interests and the foundations of the international system it once championed.

Donald Trump’s Tariffs: Bad Economics And Maybe Illegal, Too – Op...	Amid the flurry of unconstitutional or illegal executive orders from President Donald Trump—for example, the freezing of congressionally approved spending, the end of constitutionally stipulated birthright citizenship, and the mass firing of prosecutors—lies another one that, unfortunately, he is more likely to get away with. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, Trump, who earlier had questionably declared a 'national emergency' at the U.S. border, is using this law to threaten to impose 25 percent tariffs (import taxes) on Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on China 'because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.' Drug flows and illegal immigration are certainly problems, though the extent to which they rise to the legal definition of a 'national emergency' is debatable. Other means of solving them exist short of threatening to start a wider trade war with the largest U.S. trading partners and possibly threatening the post-war open-world trading system. Trump’s threatened use of tariffs seems especially punitive given the minimal level of illegal immigrants and fentanyl flowing over the border from Canada—in fact, the net flow of drugs seems to be in the reverse direction. Yet, Trump believes that because the United States has the largest market in the world, such import taxes will hurt other countries more than the United States, thus making available a valuable instrument of threatened coercion. However, countries and companies trade because it is mutually beneficial for them to do so. Therefore, threatening or imposing import taxes—paid by the American consumer—is an economic murder-suicide. Other countries may be hurt more than the United States, but the people of all countries are hurt by bilateral or multilateral trade wars. Slower economic growth and higher prices result when the flow of trade and market conditions are uncertain or impaired. Sometimes, this effect can be catastrophic. Many economists believe that the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 and foreign retaliation deepened the economic downturn into the Great Depression. As a result of economic disruptions caused by the Great Depression and World War II, the United States was instrumental in creating (and greatly benefited from) the post-war system of free trade and free markets. Ironically, Trump’s threatened import taxes and possible trade war likely will benefit China by positioning that communist country as the new guardian of free trade worldwide. The bad economics of import taxes was succinctly summed up by Senator Rand Paul(R-KY), one of the few Republicans to criticize Trump’s tariffs: 'Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.' Another question that has gotten far less attention is whether imposing import taxes under the IEEPA law is constitutional. Make no mistake, other presidents have used IEEPA many times since 1977 to retaliate for other countries’ behavior—in sixty-nine 'national emergencies,' to be exact—but these all placed U.S. restrictions on financial transactions in target countries rather than imposing taxes on Americans for their imports. This misuse of IEEPA will probably result in legal challenges. Furthermore, most of the sixty-nine declared 'national emergencies' in which IEEPA was invoked were hardly that. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 was designed to reduce presidential misuse of this overwrought designation for everyday non-catastrophic problems. Yet that act failed—probably on purpose—to constrain presidential use of such emergencies since it didn’t define them. Instead, it allowed the president to declare one as long as a specific reason was given. One recent example of the abuse of the designation of national emergencies was Barack Obama’s economic sanctions against foreign computer hackers. An even more important problem is the past delegation of Congress’s constitutional responsibility 'to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations' and 'to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises' via laws allowing broad discretion by the president. In addition to initiating war, treaties, and budgeting, Congress has also forfeited its power in international trade and taxation to an imperial presidency. In the almost inevitable legal challenges to Trump’s tariff policy, a primary one should be via the non-delegation doctrine, which maintains that Congress cannot cede legislative powers to the executive. This occurs often enough in order to blame the president for bad policies. However, the Supreme Court should view presidential abuse of trade policy with a jaundiced eye and force Congress to exercise its rightful powers.

Canada’s Ailing National Healthcare Is Not A Model For America – ...	By Nikolai G. Wenzel Earlier this month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began a US-Canada economic summit designed to improve his country’s economic climate. Canada’s political landscape is shifting. After nearly a decade in office, Trudeau has announced his resignation, with the Party leadership election scheduled for March 9. He will leave behind a country that has been grappling with a decade of disillusionment. Trudeau’s legacy will be marred by soaring taxes and a Canadian economy that many now describe as being on 'life support.' The country’s healthcare provision is the weakest part of its economy. For years, American reformers have idolized Canadian healthcare, touting it as the gold standard for universal care, and a model to replace an American system that is also broken. But the reality tells a starkly different story. In Canada, wait times are unmanageable, access to services is dwindling, and public trust is eroding. Recent data indicate that one in six Canadians lacks a regular family physician, and fewer than half can secure an appointment with a primary care provider within a day or two. This shortage has led to overwhelmed emergency rooms and significant delays in care. In 2023, more than 1.3 million Canadians abandoned emergency room visits due to excessive wait times. Some hospitals have even exceeded 200% capacity, forcing patients into hallways and onto floors. As Americans reckon with record deficits and runaway government spending, some voices are once again touting the Canadian example as cheaper and more effective than the US system. One of the loudest cheerleaders for Canada’s model is Wendell Potter, a former healthcare executive turned activist, who has lately been painting a utopian vision of Canada’s government-run healthcare in op-eds and interviews. But like all advocates of socialized medicine, Potter is peddling an illusion rather than reckoning with the harsh realities Canadians face daily. Consider the data. Patients in Canada often wait months for critical procedures. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time for medically necessary treatments in 2022 was over 27 weeks—nearly double what it was in 1993. For many Canadians, timely access to care is not a guarantee but a gamble. For patients with life-threatening conditions, these delays can mean the difference between recovery and irreversible harm. The deterioration of Canada’s healthcare has not gone unnoticed by its citizens. Recent polls show that dissatisfaction with healthcare is at an all-time high, with many Canadians now exploring private care options to bypass the public system’s inefficiencies. Some 75% of Canadians now believe their nation’s healthcare is in crisis. 'Free' healthcare costs the average citizen nearly $9,000 a year in taxes, and people who once championed Medicare are acknowledging its shortcomings. The problems plaguing Canadian healthcare are deeply rooted in its design. A single-payer arrangement relies on the government (i.e., the taxpayer) as the sole payer for healthcare services, ostensibly ensuring universal access. But basic economics predicts two problems. First, as sticker prices fall (because a portion of the cost is subsidized by taxpayers), demand will increase. Second, as the government does not respond to market forces, there is no incentive for supply to grow. When demand outpaces supply, as it has in Canada, the limitations become glaringly obvious. Hospitals face chronic underfunding, staffing shortages are widespread, and technological investments lag behind those of other developed nations. Despite a population of 40 million, there are only 432 MRI machines in the country. The US has more than 13,000. These structural issues lead to the long wait times and reduced access that have become hallmarks of Canadian healthcare. Another alarming consequence of these failures is the rising use of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID). Reports have emerged of patients feeling pressured into considering euthanasia due to inadequate access to care. Since its legalization in 2016, MAID has accounted for 4% of deaths in Canada, and some fear that systemic healthcare failures are influencing these decisions. Scarce resources must be allocated somehow; if markets can’t encourage increased supply, rationing will take place through waiting. Or worse. Meanwhile, advocates of Canada’s model argue that the American system is broken because it prioritizes profit over care. There is certainly room for reform in the US. But US healthcare is anything but a free-market wonder (or the market dystopia condemned by its detractors). Before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ('Obamacare'), more than half of US healthcare expenditures were already funded by various government sources. If we add a tangled web of regulations and distortions, it’s no wonder that prices are so high. No country’s healthcare is without flaws, but Canada’s current crisis should serve as a cautionary tale rather than an aspiration. By romanticizing Canada’s healthcare system, advocates of fully nationalized healthcare gloss over the lived experiences of countless Canadians struggling to access essential care. Their narrative does little to address the failures that have led to this crisis, offering a one-sided view of American healthcare that conveniently ignores the shortcomings of the alternative. Whether the US-Canada summit delivers meaningful solutions or simply serves as a political farewell tour remains to be seen. In any event, Trudeau’s resignation signals a new chapter for Canada, and it is an opportune moment to confront the mythologies surrounding its policies—particularly its healthcare system. Canada offers a cautionary tale of what happens when lofty ideals collide with practical realities. The cracks in Canada’s healthcare model are too large to ignore. The lesson is clear for Americans still enamored with replicating Canada’s single-payer arrangement—be careful what you wish for. Promising universal access but failing to deliver timely care is not a model worth emulating. Canada’s healthcare crisis is a wake-up call for its citizens and anyone who believes in the promise of universal care. As Trud­eau’s political legacy fades, the urgent task of addressing Canada’s failures remains. Advocates of full nationalization of healthcare would do well to shift their focus from selling dreams to confronting realities. Only then can the conversation about healthcare reform—on both sides of the border—begin to move in a meaningful direction. Healthcare in Canada, the US, and beyond needs more consumer choice, less regulation, and better-aligned incentives—not more socialism. About the author: Nikolai G.

Anthony Fauci Museum Exhibit Cancelled – OpEd	The federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has canceled a $168,000 grant for an exhibit on Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in suburban Silver Spring, Md. The cancellation might prompt people to 'muse' on the career of Dr. Fauci, who in 2021 claimed that 'attacks on me, quite frankly, are attacks on science.' That’s a rather bold claim for a non-practicing physician whose bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry, vital disciplines in the field of virology. So it was doubtless a purely bureaucratic move when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) made Dr. Fauci head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 1984. Kary Mullis, who earned a PhD from UC Berkeley, and won a Nobel Prize for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, was on record that Dr. Fauci didn’t understand medicine and 'should not be in a position like he’s in.' Fauci went on to prove Mullis right. Dr. Fauci’s drug of choice to treat AIDS was AZT (azidothymidine, zidovudine), rejected for cancer treatment because of high toxicity. In the early 1990s, Fauci’s NIAID forced AZT and other toxic drugs on foster children in New York City, with deadly results. For further information see the BBC’s Guinea Pig Kids and The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Dr. Fauci’s prediction that AIDS would ravage the general population never came to pass, and it wasn’t even close. As Michael Fumento showed in The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS, the syndrome remained most prominent among male homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and intravenous drug users. Despite the error, Dr. Fauci remained at the helm of NIAID. In 2019, Dr. Fauci funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) to perform gain-of-function research, once banned in the United States, that makes viruses more lethal and transmissible. The NIAID boss maintained that the COVID virus was 'zoonotic,' arising naturally in the wild. Scientists more qualified than Fauci, including CDC Director Robert Redfield, found evidence of a laboratory origin. Dr. Fauci branded them 'conspiracy theorists' and Dr. Redfield even got death threats. The NIAID boss imposed a lockdown regime that was particularly hard on families with children in school. That prompted the scientists of the Great Barrington Declaration to push for a more humane approach. NIH Director Francis Collins tasked Fauci with a 'devastating takedown' of those 'fringe epidemiologists,' most if not all more qualified than Fauci and Collins. Dr. Fauci proclaimed there was no need to wear a mask, then said to wear one maskbefore advocating two masks. The NIAID boss imposed distancing rules and urged vaccines even for children, the least vulnerable group. It later emerged that the masks were useless, and the distancing rules were simply made up and not based on any science. Fauci’s vaunted vaccines failed to prevent infection and transmission, which the fully boosted NIAID boss confirmed by coming down with COVID. After more than 50 years as a government bureaucrat and nearly 40 years as head of NIAID, Dr. Fauci retired in 2023 but continued to receive taxpayer-funded transportation and security services. In November 2024, Fauci authored a paper claiming that HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, was 'zoonotic,' just like the COVID virus. That reversed his position from the 1980s when he smeared the scientists who challenged him, all more qualified than himself, as 'AIDS denialists.' On Jan. 20, on his way out of the White House, Joe Biden issued a pardon for Dr. Anthony Fauci. Whatever the pardon was for—Sen. Rand Paul, author of Deception: The Great Covid Coverup, made a criminal referral to the Biden Department of Justice—wasn’t likely to turn up in Fauci’s museum exhibit. His network remains in place and that calls for deep reform. At the very least, the NIAID director should be limited to a single four-year term, with all grants posted online in real-time. Never again must a single person control public health policy and spending on medical research. Absent these and other reforms, white coat supremacy could well mount a comeback. In 2021, Dr. Fauci explained the WCS concept: I think what people have to appreciate is that indeed, you do have personal liberties for yourself and you should be in control of that. But you are a member of society, and as a member of society—reaping all the benefits of being a member of society—you have a responsibility to society. And I think each of us, particularly in the context of a pandemic that’s killing millions of people, you have got to look at it and say there comes a time when you do have to give up what you consider your individual right of making your own decision, for the greater good of society.

Ralph Nader: Trump/Musk Dictatorship Is Galvanizing The American ...	Madmen Trump and Musk are moving with warp speed to illegally and dictatorially wreck America and enrich themselves in the process. Forget the use of the terms 'autocracy' and 'constitutional crisis.' This is a savage dictatorship, getting worse by the day. Trump is attacking the courts, ignoring Congress run by a cowardly GOP, pushing to cut off critical assistance for tens of millions of Americans, devastating health, safety, food (Meals on Wheels), education (Head Start), and Medicaid insurance protections. The rabid, ravaging, unstable Musk and his Chief Musketeer Trump are shutting down whole agencies, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Agency for International Development (only Congress can do this). The CFPB is the federal cop enforcing laws against corporate crooks stealing your money in myriad ways, and returning many billions of dollars back to you. As for shuttering illegally the U.S. Agency for International Development, consider what is happening in these direly poor countries, as reported in the New York Times: 'Funds from the world’s richest nation once flowed from the largest global aid agency to an intricate network of small, medium and large organizations that delivered aid: H.I.V. medication for more than 20 million people; nutrition supplements for starving children; support for refugees, orphaned children and women battered by violence.' ('Chaos and Confusion Reign as U.S. Cuts Off Aid to Millions Globally' by Apoorva Mandavilli, February 12, 2025). Trump is also cutting monitoring for the emergence of deadly epidemics such as Ebola, drug-resistant Tuberculosis, Malaria and other lethal viruses and bacteria, which could come to the U.S. like COVID-19 did. The cost of all these vital protections is less than one percent of the federal budget. These safeguards have been supported by both Republican and Democratic Presidents – until Trump’s brutal reign of terror. Children, women (maternal health assistance) and men are dying now in places like Africa. Americans are just starting to suffer with the unlawful cutoff of funds (only Congress can do this) and the firing of thousands of dedicated civil servants ministering to their fellow Americans in need. U.S.A.I.D. is the humanitarian face of America, and Republicans like Marco Rubio once called it necessary for our country’s national security. American businesses are starting to feel Musk’s poisonous tusks. Just with closing A.I.D., this South African racist ordered the sign on its headquarters taken down. 100,000 positions have been cut overseas, an estimated 52,000 Americans in 42 states have lost their jobs. Agricultural food supplies ready for export are starting to rot in warehouses and ports, according to the Times. The Trump/Musk machetes are swinging wildly striking beyond bullying the poor, defenseless, and powerless, and also upending the business community. Much of our government is contracted out to millions of businesses – small and large. Their contracts are being ripped up by this lying, corrupt President who many business leaders helped elect last November. However, voters electing Trump didn’t mean that they elected a fascist dictator betraying his campaign boasts and 'Day One'promises with the first flurry of executive orders or dictates violating our Constitution, statutes, and international laws. There is a systemic cunning behind the wild rioting that Trump and Musk are causing. First, their actions are not about efficiency. Here is their broad scheme. First fire the cops, the law enforcers against corporate violators of worker, consumer, environmental, and small investor protections. Many federal agencies have current investigations into Musk’s companies (SEC, NHTSA, EPA, FAA, etc.). Second, establish a kleptocracy to enrich both Musk and Trump personally. (See the February 13, 2025, New York Times article by Eric Lipton titled 'Under Trump Shake-Up, Benefits for Musk Empire'). Third, smash programs assisting people, while protecting huge waste, fraud, and abuse from corporate crime harming taxpayers (e.g., fraud on Medicare/Medicaid) and vast outlays of corporate welfare – giveaways, subsidies, bailouts, and endless tax escapes by big business. After all, Trump and Musk are both corporatists. The military/industrial complex’s unauditable Pentagon budget is untouchable. Far from squeezing the enormous waste, redundancy, and corporate fraud, Trump gives every sign of supporting an additional $150 billion, which should go for domestic necessities, to this years’ Defense Department’s swollen taxpayer appropriations. After all, Trump and Musk are militarists. What of the resistance, presently mounting, but still outrun and over-run by the Trumpster gangsters? Americans don’t like to be told to shut up; they don’t like to have things rightfully theirs taken from their families; they don’t like to be fired en masse without cause; they don’t like government contracts for vital services being arbitrarily broken. They also don’t like their government being overthrown by fascistic gangsters. Street demonstrations are spreading from Washington to California, from Oregon to Florida. Government employees and their unions are filing lawsuits in federal courts. Half of the country’s state Attorneys General are filing numerous court challenges. The mainstream media, under direct attack by Trump, and being frivolously sued by Trump, is still reporting and investigating. The campuses will start rumbling as Trump/Musk cuts to medical research and other aids to education corrode these institutions. Retired military personnel are voicing their objections to the devastation of the kind of America and the freedom they fought to defend. (See veteransforpeace.org.) Veteran benefits are on draft-dodger Trump’s cutting table. The American Bar Association (ABA) has finally spoken out. On February 11, 2025, the ABA assailed the disregard of the judiciary and threats to judges by Trump/Musk/Vance, which 'threaten the very foundation of our constitutional system.' The ABA calls for every lawyer and legal organization to speak with one voice and to condemn the efforts of any administration that suggests its actions are beyond the reach of judicial review.' Soon the business community, unable to tolerate the chaos, inflation, instability, and recklessness of Trump’s regime’s contracting violations, will speak out as economic indices fall, including stock markets. It will take a few weeks or months, with heightened inflation, for this disruptive pipeline to reach critical mass as it will everywhere including the Red States where Trump supporters are concentrated. As one example, one of Biden’s enacted laws 'is projected to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into low-carbon energy technologies.' Most of these benefits are in Republican-voting communities in Red States 'where they are creating a once-in-a-generation manufacturing boom.' (The New York Times). Recall, Trump’s 'drill, baby, drill' mantra of climate violence was linked with downgrading efficient solar energy and shutting down wind power projects under construction, along with the EPA’s work. Once Trump’s voters and his business base start turning against him, with wide media coverage and dropping polls, the stage will be set for surging demands for his resignation and impeachment that starts with 'impossible,' then 'possible,' then 'probable,' then conviction. If the GOP sees either its political skin at risk in 2026 versus Trump’s destructive, daily delusions and dangerous daily damage, politicians will put their political fortunes first. That is what Congressional Republicans did when they told Nixon to resign in 1974 over the Watergate scandal – a peapod by comparison with Trump’s wholesale subversions of our government to one man rule who has said 'With Article II, I can do whatever I want as President.' Call the White House switchboard 202-456-1414 and tell Trump to stop the destruction of America and go back to Mar-a-Lago.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adESSDNs-XzyJ	2025-02-17T15:44:40-08:00	
Maldives: Treading Cautiously – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya Maldives recorded no terrorism-linked fatality in 2024. The abduction and killing of blogger Yameen Rasheed by a local affiliate of Al-Qaeda on April 23, 2017, was the last terrorism related incident of the country. There have, nevertheless, been at least nine terrorist attacks in the country since the Rasheed killing, including three in 2019, four in 2020 and one each in 2021 and 2022. Further, there have been no incidents of terrorism-linked arrests in Maldives in 2024, continuing with the trend of 2023, as against 26 such arrests in 2022. Nevertheless, as reported in January 2024, according to the country's intelligence sources, Maldives not only remains a hub of Islamic State (IS) operatives but also of Pakistan-based terrorist groups, as well as of narcotics smugglers with international linkages. Sources indicate that a Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) base has also been identified in Maldives in the past. Maldives faces a major problem from radical Islamist fundamentalists who fund local governments, with the involvement of some big business houses. These business houses have also been drawn towards China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Moreover, key Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) operative Umar Nisar Bhat alias Qasim Khorasani, who was arrested in 2021, stated in his confession that he was in regular touch with the Bangladesh and Maldives-based Islamic Ameer (chief), who could have used this link to expand terrorist propaganda networks. However, at the official level, on October 1, 2024, Maldives participated in the 10th Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS (D-ISIS) hosted by then U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, D.C. and reiterated Maldives' unwavering belief that terrorism must never be associated with any religion, nationality, or ethnicity. With the Maldives engagement at the Ministerial Meeting, Malé also reaffirmed its commitment to fostering global security, promoting dialogue, and advancing the shared aspiration for a peaceful and prosperous world. This marks Maldives' inaugural participation in the D-ISIS Ministerial, following its formal membership of the Coalition in August 2023. In 2024, the Ministry of Homeland Security and Technology undertook strategic initiatives targeting four challenging areas that needed to be addressed to ensure the country's internal security and safety, including persisting drug issues. On November 24, the President of Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, stated that it is one of the highest priorities of the government to transform Maldives into a drug-free environment. Muizzu's statement came in a post on 'X', after the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) seized 468.6 kg of illicit drugs from a Sri Lankan vessel that illegally entered into Maldivian waters. Maldives have been dealing with various narcotics-related issues that have plagued the archipelago for many decades, and adequate reform has not been brought about to date. Nevertheless, as reported on December 9, President Muizzu disclosed that his government has stepped up efforts to combat drug trafficking, and six times more drugs were seized in 2024, as compared to 2023. President said the drugs seized so far this year are estimated to have a street value of around USD 84 million. He added that over 150 expatriates linked to drug trafficking have been deported so far this year (2024), which is twice that of 2023, and that the Police had raided over 13,435 establishments in 2024, amid a nationwide crackdown on trafficking, as compared to around 8,500 raids conducted in 2023. Further, as reported on January 9, efforts have been commenced to detect the Maldives' main gateway, Velana International Airport's (VIA's) camera blind spots and increase security to address the smuggling of drugs via air. Efforts are also ongoing to install vessel tracking devices to tackle drug trafficking via sea. The archipelago is also grappling with an increased rate of cybercrime. The number of reported cybercrimes in Maldives nearly doubled in 2024, as compared to 2023, as revealed by Police Commissioner Ali Shujau on December 11, 2024. Shujau emphasised the urgent need to curb the spread of cybercrime and expand cyber security measures across the nation. 'In 2023, the Maldives Police Service recorded 99 cybercrime cases. This year, the figure has risen sharply to 173,' Commissioner Shujau disclosed. In a positive direction, Maldives has enacted legislative amendments to criminalise cybercrime. On December 17, the amendments to the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Act on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, were ratified by President Muizzu. The amendments to the Penal Code formally recognise cybercrime within the legal framework and categorizes 10 activities as cyber offenses: Unauthorized access to computer systems Accessing unauthorized computer systems with the intention of committing a crime Intercepting unauthorized data on computer systems Interfering with unauthorized computer systems Misuse of computer systems or similar devices Acts of cyber violence Computer-related forgeries Acts of fraud and misrepresentation related to computer systems Infringement of copyright and associated rights People found guilty of such offenses will be subject to upwards of one year in prison. Comprehensive economic reforms are urgently needed in Maldives, to address fiscal and external imbalances, build investor confidence, and reduce debt over the medium-term. On October 10, 2024, a World Bank report titled Maldives Development Update: Seeking Stability in Turbulent Times, underlined heightened external and fiscal vulnerabilities that required the urgent implementation of comprehensive economic reforms. While overall inflation remained low at 0.5 per cent in the first half of 2024, food prices rose by 6.7 per cent in the same period, as compared to the previous year. Foreign exchange reserves are also low, enough to cover only 1.5 months of imports. Dollar reserves fell from USD 590.5 million at the end of 2023 to USD 443.9 million in August 2024. Further, in the month of December 2024, the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) reported that the inflation rate, which was at 0.3 per cent during the second quarter, had risen to 1.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2024. The Central Bank released its Economic Quarterly Bulletin, in which it emphasized that this increase in inflation could mainly be attributed to price changes in the energy sector. President Muizzu of the People's National Congress (PNC) party won the September 2023 presidential elections, with a 54.06 per cent of the vote in the run-off contest, defeating incumbent President Ibrahim Solih. In April 2024, the PNC won a super-majority in the People's Majlis (Parliament), with 66 seats, while its allies won 9 seats, giving Muizzu the support of 75 of the 93 members of the Majlis. It won't be wrong to say that the economic disturbances of the country are the reason for Muizzu's tip-toeing between India and China. With his 'India Out' campaign at the forefront, Muizzu visited Beijing in January, 2023, signing infrastructure and climate deals with China - but he has not burned bridges with New Delhi. He described India as a 'valued partner' and in the aftermath of his Indian visit in October, 2024, India approved a USD 400 million currency swap agreement, to support the cash-strapped Maldivian economy. With a string of domestic issues and economic challenges, Maldives needs to tread cautiously to sustain itself under Mohamed Muizzu's leadership. The archipelago is in dire need of better management of regional players, of economic crises, of the challenge of radicalization, and of the increased narco-threat.

India: Reinforcing Gains In Maharashtra – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On February 11, 2025, the inspector of a special commando unit C-60, Mahesh Kavadu Nagulwar (39), died, succumbing to injuries sustained during an anti-Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) operation in the Bhamragad Tehsil (revenue unit) of Gadchiroli District. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis confirmed the Police inspector's death during an exchange of fire at Bhamragadh, where the Police team was dismantling a Maoist camp. Following the encounter, the Police team conducted a thorough search of the area and recovered significant Maoist materials, including an approximately 100 feet of Cordex wire, 15 Gelatin sticks, four detonators, solar plates, walkie-talkies, and other equipment used in daily operations by the rebels. On February 1, 2025, ex-panchayat samiti (local governing body) chairman Sukhram Madavi was killed by CPI-Maoist cadres at Kiyer village in the Bhamragad Tehsil of Gadchiroli District for allegedly helping Security Forces (SFs) set up permanent posts in the region. The Maoists left a pamphlet near the body stating that Madavi earned the Maoists' ire for assisting the Police in opening posts to facilitate mining operations by private companies. The Maoists were also angered by Madavi's alleged role in helping disenchanted cadres surrender to the Police. However, Superintendent of Police (SP) Neelotpal claimed that the Maoists falsely accused Madavi of being a 'police informer' and of assisting the Police set up new camps, including one at Pengunda. Two persons have thus been killed (one SF Inspector and one civilian) in the two incidents of Left Wing Extremist (LWE)-linked violence in Maharashtra in 2025, thus far (data till February 16). According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), three civilians were killed through 2024 in Maharashtra. There were five such killings in 2023. Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE-linked violence across the country, a total of 205 such killings have been documented in the state, including a high of 36 civilian fatalities in 2011. Significantly, SFs did not suffer any loss in Maharashtra through 2024, as well as in 2023. The state recorded no loss in this category through 2022 and 2021. The last SF fatality recorded was on August 14, 2020, when a Police constable was killed and another constable sustained injuries, when a CPI-Maoist 'action team' opened fire on them in a market at the Kothi village under the Bhamragad Tehsil of Gadchiroli District. In remaining part of the year, another two fatalities were recorded in 2020, bringing the count of SF fatalities to three through 2020. The SF category recorded a high of 52 fatalities in 2009. A total of 171 such killings have been recorded since March 6, 2000. Meanwhile, SFs neutralised at least 24 Maoists in 2024, in addition to six in 2023. A maximum of 51 Maoist fatalities was recorded in 2018. A total of 351 such killings have been recorded in the state since March 6, 2000. Significantly, the last SF:Maoist kill ratio recorded was 1:3 in 2020. There were no SF fatalities between 2021 and 2024. Meanwhile, the favourable kill ratio for the SF was 1:25.5, recorded in 2018. Significantly, the overall SF:Maoist kill ratio in the state since 2000 has been 1:2.05, in favour of the SFs. In 2024, SFs arrested nine Naxalites (LWEs), in addition to seven such arrests in 2023, according to the SATP database. Since March 6, 2000, 490 Maoists have been arrested. Mounting SF pressure also resulted in the surrender of 19 Naxalites in 2024, in addition to five in 2023. Since March 6, 2000, total surrenders stand at 333, including 21 such surrenders already recorded in the current year (data till February 16). In the most recent surrender, on February 10, 2025, four wanted CPI-Maoist cadres, collectively carrying a bounty of INR 2.8 million, surrendered before the Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Gadchiroli District. The surrendered Maoists include Ashok Pochya Sadmek aka Balanna aka Chandrashekhar (63), a 'divisional committee member (DVCM)', Vanita Dohe Zore (54), 'area committee member (ACM)', Sadhu Lingu Mohanda aka Shailesh aka Sameer (30) and Munni Podiya Korsa (25), both Platoon Members of Platoon No. 32. Other parameters of LWE-linked violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation in the state. There was no major incident (resulting in three or more fatalities) involving the Maoists in 2024, as well as in 2023. The last major incident was recorded on May 1, 2019, when at least 15 SF personnel of the special commando unit C-60 of the Maharashtra Police, and one civilian driver, were killed in an ambush by CPI-Maoist cadres, who triggered an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion on the Dadapur Road near Lendali Nullah in Jamburkheda village under Kurkheda Police Station limits in Gadchiroli District. The Maoists failed to carry out any incident of arson in 2024, as against one such incident in 2023. On March 2, 2023, a group of CPI-Maoist cadres set three road construction machines on fire between Pursalgondi and Alenga in the Etapalli Tehsil in Gadchiroli District. Further, the Maoists did not issue any bandh (shut down strike) call in 2024, as against one such call in 2023. On November 23, 2023, the CPI-Maoist called for a 'Gadchiroli bandh' on November 30 in protest against Police action in dispersing anti-mining protesters from Todgatta village in Etapalli Tehsil, Gadchiroli District. The CPI-Maoist 'western sub-zonal bureau' called for the bandh. According to the SATP database, all Maoist-linked fatalities Maharashtra in 2024 were reported from Gadchiroli District alone. Likewise, in 2023, all fatalities were reported from Gadchiroli. Meanwhile, an analysis of underground and over-ground activities of the Maoists in 2024 indicated that, while Gadchiroli remained highly-affected, Gondia and Pune were considered marginally affected. By comparison, in 2023, Gadchiroli remained highly-affected, while Gondia was marginally affected. An analysis of the overall fatalities recorded in Maharashtra since March 6, 2000, indicates that, out of 738 fatalities (205 civilians, 171 SF personnel, 351 Naxalites and 12 Unspecified), at least 722 (196 civilians, 167 SF personnel, 348 Naxalites, and 12 Unspecified) were recorded in Gadchiroli alone, followed by seven (five civilians and two SF personnel) in Gondia, three (one civilian and two SF personnel) in Bhandara, two (one civilian and one LWE) in Nagpur, and one civilian in Aurangabad. The location of three fatalities (one civilian and two Maoists) remains unspecified. Maharashtra has a total of 35 districts. The last fatality outside Gadchiroli was recorded on October 18, 2019, in Gondia District, when CPI-Maoist cadres shot dead a civilian, Bhagchand Dhurve (50), suspecting him of being a 'police informer'. Against the backdrop of the declining impact of the CPI-Maoist, especially in Gadchiroli district, the epicenter of Maoist violence in Maharashtra, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken several steps against LWE elements in Maharashtra. Most recently, on January 2, 2025, NIA chargesheeted four CPI-Maoist cadres for the abduction and brutal killing of a youth in Gadchiroli District. The accused, Doba Wadde, Ravi Pallo, Sattu Mahaka, and Komati Mahaka, were charged with the abduction and murder of Dinesh Pusu Gawade in November 2023. Tha NIA stated, 'They had kidnapped and killed Gawade on suspicion of being a police informer and a member of RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh].' In its chargesheet filed before the NIA Special Court, Mumbai, Maharashtra, in case RC-03/2024/NIA/MUM, the agency stated that the accused were active members of CPI-Maoist and had committed the crime in furtherance of the outfit's conspiracy to spread terror in the minds of the local villagers. The case was initially registered at Dhodraj Police Station by Gadchiroli Police, which arrested the accused and seized a Bharmar gun, along with explosives and other incriminating materials. Meanwhile, according to a November 8, 2024, report, security and intelligence agencies joined forces to increase surveillance on around 180 pro-CPI-Maoist private (front) organisations spread across Maharashtra. These frontal organisations project various socio-political agendas, but their main aim is to ensure that no parties inimical to the Maoist cause come to power in Maharashtra. The end goal is to prevent the formulation and implementation of plans to eradicate Maoism from the region. The frontal organisations are reportedly active in many Maharashtra cities, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Nanded, Yavatmal, Akola, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Wardha, Bhandara, and Gondia. Moreover, Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah has urged Maoist-affected states such as Maharashtra to set a deadline for the complete elimination of Maoism. The Maharashtra government, which is planning a law against front organisations of the banned CPI-Maoist, titled the Maharashtra Security Act, has reportedly set a deadline of April-December 2025. The Maoists are failing in their appeals to secure the support of the local masses. On June 14, 2024, seven tribal hamlets of Bhamragadh Tehsil in the foothills of Abujhmadh, which houses the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) headquarters on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, banned the CPI-Maoist from entering their hamlets under the government's 'gaonbandi' scheme of rewarding villages for not giving support or providing assistance to Naxalites. The tribal hamlets of Paraynar, Nelgunda, Kucher, Kawande, Gongewada, Midadapalli, and Mahakapadi are escaping Maoist influence after four decades of forced indoctrination in the ultra-Left ideology. On June 14, 2024, they took a historic vow during a 'krishi melava' or agricultural congregation at the Dhodraj Police outpost, to shun the Maoists and extend support to SFs, in lieu of government benefits which form the bulwark of the 'gaonbandi' scheme. They promised to shut out Maoists, boycott their meetings, and ban their entry into villages, which are often used as launchpads for guerrilla operations, as well as to propagate LWE ideology, or organise political and military training camps. To bolster security against the rebels and curb their activities, a new Police Station was inaugurated on January 30, 2025, at Nelgunda in the Bhamragad sub-division of Gadchiroli District, to strengthen security and promote overall development in the remote and inaccessible parts of the district, which has long been affected by Maoist activity. On January 1, 2025, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis inaugurated the 32-km-long Gatta-Gardewada-Wangeturi Road and bus services of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation on the Wangeturi-Gardewada-Gatta-Aheri route in the Gadchiroli district. The road link will connect Maharashtra directly to Chhattisgarh. On December 11, 2024, a new Police Assistance Centre was opened at village Pengunda under Bhamragad Sub-Division, with the objective of providing security and overall development to the citizens of the extremely remote Pengunda and surrounding villages, to bring them into the mainstream of development. Meanwhile, according to a January 3, 2025, report, Chief Minister Fadnavis reintroduced the Maharashtra Special Public Security Bill, 2024, during the winter session of the State Assembly, asserting that the proposed law does not attempt to suppress genuine dissenting voices, but to close down the dens of 'urban Naxals' instead. The Bill has been sent to a Joint Committee and will be brought up again during the monsoon session later this year. Despite important security and developmental components, Maharashtra continues to suffer critical gaps of strength and quality in the State Police Force meant to fight against any kind of internal challenge. According to the latest Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, the sanctioned strength for the States' Police was 232,965, but only 172,382 personnel were in position, yielding a vacancy of 60,583 (26 percent). Police personnel per 100,000 population in Maharashtra currently stand at a sanctioned 184.92, while those actually available are 136.83. Further, the Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometers) for Maharashtra is just 56.02, as against the national average of 65.14. Both the State and national averages on the Police/Area ratio are well below their sanctioned strength, at 75.71 and 82.82, respectively. Further, of a sanctioned strength of 317 apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State, 41 posts, i.e., 12.93 per cent, remained vacant, substantially weakening executive command of the Force. At least two out of 1,191 Police Stations had no telephones. The Maharashtra Police has been able to ensure a relatively safe environment on the ground, and has substantially contained the Maoist challenge. This is an opportunity for SFs to further consolidate their gains and eradicate Naxalism from the state.

People Survive On Less Than $1.9 A Day In A District Of Atyrau Pr...	According to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2024, developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Human Development and Poverty Initiative, 1.1 billion people live in acute poverty worldwide, meaning they dispose of less than $1.90 per day as living expenses, with 40 percent living in countries experiencing war, fragility, and/or low peacefulness. The Zhyloi district, with its center in Kulsary, an oil workers' town in the Atyrau province of Kazakhstan, is not experiencing war, fragility, and/or low peacefulness, yet there, as it turns out, are people there, too, who live in such poverty that they dispose of far less than $1.90 a day per person as living expenses while being at the heart of the Kazakh State's gas and oil producing industry, that provides the very basis of economic and social well-being of the republic's 20 million-strong population considered an upper-middle-income nation. The paradox of that situation doesn't end there. What's more, the Zhyloi district definitely is the richest district in the country. As of October 1, 2022, the population of the district was 86,118 people, and the town of Kulsary accounted for more than 70 percent of them (65,964 people in 2023). That is, the Zhyloi district is, first of all, the oil workers' town of Kulsary. Being just a part of the Atyrau province, it is potentially richer than any province of Kazakhstan, except maybe the Atyrau province itself. It is potentially richer than many individual post-Soviet States, as this is the largest oil-producing district in Kazakhstan, with over 40 oil fields with total reserves of 2.5 billion tons. But this all has seemingly been of little use to Kulsary, where more than two-thirds of its population is concentrated. On February 10, 2025, residents of the town of Kulsary took to the streets, asking for employment opportunities. They said unemployment had reached a critical level, with many able-bodied citizens left without income and forced to live on [state] benefits that would end in six months. 'What should we do next? Here is what we ask: the local companies should provide people with work on a 14/14 system (shift work). Now, we are being laid off. And we have come here to be heard. This is not a rally or a provocation. We just want to show how many people have been left without work', - said the protesters. Among the participants of the action was Zhanargul Sagynbai, a district activist, who noted that there had been about 100 people gathered for the rally, although there are actually more of them [unemployed ones in Kulsary]. She referred to a situation in one family where four able-bodied members are forced to live on the income of the daughter-in-law, who earns only three thousand tenge [around US$6] a day from trade. If this sum is divided by the number of able-bodied family members, each would get US$1,5. Surely, there are also children in that family. So, one can just imagine living like that. It would seem that such a protest action was due to be an event of general importance in the country as its social and economic well-being is, among other things, built on the Zhyloi district's oil and gas industry. However, it remained largely unnoticed in the Kazakh mainstream media. The central authorities of the country, as far as is known, paid no attention to it. In this sense, official Astana seems to be putting their trust merely in the State and pro-government Kazakh media and bloggers. The latter ones, as far as can be judged, largely follow the classic models of Soviet propaganda before the perestroika period. That is, they mainly display the achievements of the country and speak negatively about those who criticize the ruling regime and its policies, and sometimes, about, say, striking oil workers in Western Kazakhstan, asking for employment opportunities, or demanding higher salaries and better working conditions. Here’s how Miras Nurmukhanbetov, а Kazakh journalist, described one such case a while ago: 'In short, those ‘opinion leaders’ focus on several aspects. These are ‘dependency attitude’ [i.e. ‘parasitic attitude’, ‘parasitic way of life’, or ‘parasitism’], ‘repatriates’, ‘already high salaries’ and so on, with a direct or indirect conclusion that ‘it is beneficial for someone to rock the boat’… But it is obvious that those opinion leaders to a greater extent promote the latent position of official bodies and the no less official KazMunayGas [national oil and gas company]. The authorities, for obvious reasons, cannot voice it, so as not to worsen their already shaky image. However, they believe that they were able to form a negative opinion about the strikes among at least part of society. By and large, the formula ‘divide and conquer’ is again set in motion, dividing Kazakhs into ‘ours’, who are supposedly objective and earn their bread (with caviar), and into ‘troublemakers’ who strive to stand out from others. Here, it must be emphasized that part of the audience of those public opinion leaders needs this to calm down and find excuses for themselves because almost all of them have nothing to do with Mangystau province and the oil-producing West [Western Kazakhstan] as a whole. This has always been the case, and it has been repeated after almost any socio-political excesses. But in this case, we are witnessing a real escalation of the situation, when such bloggers, as conductors of the authorities’ opinions, ‘appoint’ those to blame instead of looking for ways for dialogue'. Kazakhstan’s revenues from Western Kazakhstan’s oil and gas fields feed the national budget and are being used for supporting the subsidy-dependent provinces, which are composed of the country’s all other regions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Southern Kazakhstan. At the same time, people in the oil-producing region are increasingly getting bogged down by social, economic, and environmental problems, exacerbated by persistent drought and water scarcity. Not without reason are the richest provinces of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with an average per capita GDP comparable to that of some EU Member States, have now been called by Russian experts ‘the destitute West’ of Kazakhstan. It should seem astonishing for West Kazakhs to be called by Russian experts ‘destitute’, and ‘Barbarians’ by Chimkent Kazakhs in conditions when, say, in 2008, per capita income in the Atyrau province of Western Kazakhstan was almost 15 times higher ($23.6 thousand) than in the South Kazakhstan province ($1.8 thousand), which then included Chimkent. It is clear that people there (in Western Kazakhstan) mostly can’t be happy with such a state of things. That seems to be the reason there are often demonstrations and strikes over there. The situation in Kulsary described above is pretty strange on its own. It seems to be even weirder when you take in that here, we speak of a district on the territory of which over one-third of the budget revenues of the Kazakh state were generated in, say, 2018. And that is no exaggeration. Over a third or more than 35% of the Kazakh republican budget revenues planned for 2018 (without transfers) for 5 trillion 528.4 billion tenge fell to share of the Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) alone. It’s easy to verify if one wants to. The TCO operates a license that includes the unique, supergiant Tengiz field and the adjacent, smaller but still significant, Korolevskoye field. Both fields are in the Zhyloy district territory, the center of which is Kulsary, a town that, less than a year ago, has been badly hit by the devastating water floods. In 2023, the TCO produced 28.9 million metric tons of oil. That is more than the peak figures of Kazakhstan as a whole in the Soviet years and just a little less than what Azerbaijan produced in 2023: 30.2 million metric tons of crude and gas condensate. However, even with all this, some people have to struggle to survive on less than $1,9 a day in the Zhyloi district of the Atyrau province, which is richer than the whole rest of Kazakhstan. This is the way things are.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adD9fCSZuBI_-	2025-02-17T15:37:20-08:00	
Trump’s Ukraine Envoy ‘Clarifies’ What Europe’s Seat At The Table...	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- European views will be taken into account and Ukraine will not be pressured into a deal, the US envoy for Ukraine and Russia told a group of reporters at NATO HQ. Keith Kellogg's two-day visit to Brussels comes amid growing unease among European allies that a future Ukraine peace deal would be struck over their and Kyiv's heads, as neither of them is expected to participate in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, tomorrow. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Kyiv would not agree to a deal that would be detrimental to his country or that resulted from negotiations in which he didn't participate. Kellogg said 'nobody' would impose decisions on Zelenskyy as the 'elected leader of a sovereign nation' and the decision about striking a deal would ultimately be the Ukrainians'. Trump’s Ukraine envoy is expected to travel to Kyiv tomorrow night for a three-day visit, where he is scheduled to meet with the Ukrainian leader. He will then return to Washington and continue a tour of NATO capitals in the next few weeks. At the table Asked by Euractiv about his comments made on stage in Munich that 'Europeans would not be at the table,' Kellogg clarified that this would not mean European concerns would not be taken into account. 'If you believe there are going to be thirty-three people sitting at the same table – exactly the same table – during the discussion, in all probability, the answer is no, not at all,' Kellogg said. 'If 'at the table' means that your views are heard, understood, transmitted, the answer is absolutely,' he said. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals earlier last week to determine what resources they would be ready to contribute to a possible future peacekeeping force. 'Before any type of discussion and security guarantees is finalised, of course, those discussions are going to take place,' Kellogg said. 'Answers to those questions will be determined as you come up with the final process,' he added, throwing the ball back to the Europeans' court. Status concerns Kellogg's absence from the US negotiating team travelling to Riyadh raised questions over his leverage on Trump's efforts to draw up a peace proposal – and how European input will find its way into them. Responding to concerns about his status in the process, Kellogg said, 'That doesn't mean that the team is not fully synced.' 'They are going to come out of the Middle East, I will come out of Ukraine – we will go back to being synched up,' he said, adding he had a joint conference call with the negotiating team over the phone after Munich. The team includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adJ71pDTO5Ouj	2025-02-17T15:34:11-08:00	
China Warns Philippines Of ‘Red Line’ In The South China Sea	Maritime tensions between China and the Philippines were in the spotlight at the Munich Security Conference, with former Chinese vice foreign minister Fu Ying calling the occupation of disputed features in the South China Sea 'a red line.' Speaking at a forum at the annual international security conference at the weekend, Fu said that China had a very strong position on ownership over territories and 'we cannot lose them.' The former vice minister said China would not agree to the Philippines occupying the Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal, where Chinese and Philippine ships have been confronting each other over the past two years. Both are within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. Fu, who served as Chinese ambassador to the Philippines from 1998 to 2000, spoke of how Manila deliberately ran aground an old naval ship on the Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to use as an outpost. It attempted to do the same at Scarborough Shoal, which is classified as a rock under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS. 'If the Philippines can take new rocks how can you stop others?' Fu asked. 'How can you stop China from taking more?' 'We’re capable, there’s no problem, but we are exercising constraint,' the former diplomat said, adding that China was committed to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea that urges claimants to handle their differences in a constructive manner. 'That’s a red line no one should be allowed to cross … that kind of naughtiness shouldn’t be encouraged,' she said. China’s domestic law at sea Philippines foreign secretary Enrique Manalo, meanwhile, said his country was 'following international law.' 'But when another country … applies its own domestic laws to certain areas within our exclusive economic zone then it really does create the kind of tension that we have been experiencing especially over the last two years,' Manalo said. All the disputed features mentioned by Fu are miles away from the Chinese coast, Manolo pointed out. The foreign secretary added that Manila had received support from like-minded nations. 'I haven’t heard of any country really coming out against what we’ve been doing except for one,' he said, referring to China. Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven developed countries, or G7, who also met at the Munich Security Conference, 'reiterated their commitment to a free, open and secure Indo-Pacific region, grounded in respect for the rule of law and sovereignty,' they said in a joint statement. 'They strongly opposed China’s attempts to restrict freedom of navigation through militarization and coercive activities in the South China Sea.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met separately with his Philippine counterpart, Enrique Manolo, and 'not only reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the United States-Philippines Alliance, but noted his enthusiasm for building an even more invested and enduring relationship,' the U.S. State Department said. US-China strategic competition For her part, Fu said, 'what concerns China now is the shadow of the U.S. behind the claimants.' Singapore’s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, said that China’s stance on the South China Sea was that countries outside the region should not get involved. But the question 'when China is strong enough what would it do?' is what strikes fear in countries in the region, Ng said, 'It’s up to China to assure its neighbors,' he said. The Singaporean minister noted that China wanted to show deterrence by strength as the U.S. does and the strategic competition between the U.S. and China 'is still in play' in the South China Sea. Speaking of the U.S.-China rivalry, Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi, after delivering a keynote speech at the Munich gathering, said that the two countries 'must not come into conflict, otherwise, the world will suffer.' 'China is full of confidence in the future of China-U.S. relations, but if the United States insists on suppressing China, China will have no choice but to fight to the end,' Wang said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adLbxGkpaS-gs	2025-02-17T15:32:14-08:00	
Ukraine Won’t ‘Recognize’ US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia, Zelens...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine will not participate in the upcoming talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters in Abu Dhabi, where he was visiting as part of a Middle East tour, which also includes Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Zelenskyy on February 17 said Ukraine was unaware of the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia and considers any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine to serve no purpose. 'We cannot recognize any agreements about us without us,' Zelenskyy told reporters in the capital of the United Arab Emirates. 'And we will not recognize such agreements,' added Zelenskyy, who traveled on to Turkeyafter his U.A.E. stop. Meanwhile, the U.S. presidential envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, told reporters that no one will force a peace deal on Zelenskyy, and that he and the people of Ukraine would make that call. 'Nobody will impose [a peace agreement] on an elected leader of a sovereign nation,' Kellogg said. He earlier caused a stir when he said Europe may not be 'at the table' if the United States brokers negotiations to end Russia's war against Ukraine. He later clarified to say that even if Europe were not 'at the table,' its views would be taken into account. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed those remarks, saying Ukraine and other European nations would be included in any meaningful negotiation sessions, if and when they take place. 'Ultimately, it will reach a point -- if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet -- but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved because they're the ones that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they have sanctions on [President Vladimir] Putin and Russia as well,' Rubio said. 'We're just not there yet.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, arrived in Riyadh late on February 17, set to take part in bilateral talks with their U.S. counterparts in Saudi Arabia on February 18. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the meeting will focus on restoring relations between Moscow and Washington, while Ushakov told Russian state TV that the delegation would be approaching the talks with a 'businesslike' attitude. Upon arrival, Ushakov said that 'the main thing is to achieve a real normalization of relations between us and Washington.' The United States will be represented by Rubio, who is already in Riyadh, national security-adviser Mike Waltz, and special envoy Steve Witkoff, the State Department confirmed. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow with his Serbian counterpart ahead of the Saudi talks, Lavrov claimed that Europe had already had several chances to be involved in a settlement on Ukraine but that he didn't know how European politicians could contribute given that they want the war to continue. While there are different views on Ukraine among European politicians, most agree that they want 'a just and lasting peace' to be settled with Ukraine at the table. U.S. President Donald Trump on February 16 insisted that Zelenskyy 'will be involved' in any peace negotiations to end the Russian war, while he also stated that he could meet 'very soon' with Putin. Trump did not specify details. Bloomberg, citing unnamed officials, reported on February 16 that Trump wants to secure a cease-fire by Easter, which falls on April 20 this year both for Western and Orthodox churches. Trump told reporters his team has had 'long and hard' talks with Russian officials and that Witkoff had spoken with Putin for three hours recently. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine on February 20, Zelenskyy said at a virtual press conference with Ukrainian reporters. 'I want him to visit the front line with me [...] We will meet [Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr] Syrskiy and maybe some brigade commanders,' Zelenskyy said. Kyiv said Zelenskyy's visit to the region was aimed at boosting economic ties and that there were no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials. Zelenskyy late on February 17 said he had arrived in Turkey for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish presidential spokesman Fahrettin Altun said Zelenskyy will meet with Erdogan on February 18 to discuss 'regional and global' issues. Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Saudi Arabia on February 19, although specific details were not disclosed. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, said that 'there are no negotiators who will represent Ukraine in Saudi Arabia' in peace talks. 'Today, there is nothing on the negotiating table that could be discussed. Russia is not ready for negotiations,' he told Ukrainian TV. Zelenskyy has said he would not engage in negotiations before meeting with allies, including European leaders, to develop a strategy. 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never,' Zelenskyy told NBC's Kristen Welker on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. He said there cannot be a legitimate peace plan in the works because 'they can't have it without us.... Maybe there are some ideas.' In the same interview, Zelenskyy told Welker that Ukraine had suffered '46,000 killed soldiers' and approximately '380,000 wounded' since February 2022 in the war. Russia hasn't disclosed losses, but Western sources have put the death and wounded toll at more than 600,000, not including losses suffered by North Korean soldiers involved in the fighting. Meanwhile, some 4,600 kilometers away, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted European leaders on February 17 in an emergency summit on the Ukraine war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adGSGgqUU2Ifs	2025-02-17T15:30:19-08:00	
Criminal Complaint Filed Against Ex-President Duterte For ‘Threat...	By Jason Gutierrez The Philippine National Police (PNP) filed a criminal complaint against former president Rodrigo Duterte over his alleged threat to kill incumbent senators, some of whom were campaigning under the ticket of his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte made the remark on Thursday when he introduced senators he was campaigning for in the May midterm polls. Brig. Gen. Nicolas Torre III, chief of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, said the former president allegedly violated laws against incitement to sedition and unlawful utterances. 'I am filing this as a citizen. And you know, I’m a policeman. It’s part of the PNP to make sure that we protect the citizenry from criminal activities like this,' Torres told reporters on Monday, noting that Duterte has many 'blind supporters' who could actually take him seriously. He filed the complaint before the justice department and asked prosecutors to study it. 'You know, this is beyond politics. Don't think that this is politics and that I’m doing this to favor politics. We don’t have politics there. What is stated in the statement is a clear enumeration of violations of laws written in our laws. It cannot be ignored just like that,' Torre said. On Thursday, the former president told supporters about using a bomb to kill 15 senators to create vacancies for the senatorial bets he is supporting. 'Now, there’s many of them,' Duterte said on Thursday, referring to the incumbent senators. 'What should we do? Let’s kill the senators now to create vacancies.' 'If we can kill around 15 senators, we can all go in,' the ex-president sent, referring to the senatorial bets he was campaigning for. He said that the 'only way to do it is to use a bomb.' Five incumbent senators, including President Marcos’ sister, Imee, were running for reelection under the administration ticket. Duterte’s lawyer, Salvador Panelo, said he was confident the case would be dismissed because the former president’s remarks should not be taken seriously. He said the senators would find the joke 'just as amusing and (a) laughable remark.' But Torre said Duterte’s jokes 'are no longer acceptable.' 'He wants to kill the 15 senators he wants to bomb (them),' Torre said. The police are urging 'the public to respect the legal process and avoid speculation that may mislead or create unnecessary division,' Torre said. President Marcos touched on Duterte’s remarks during Saturday’s rally for his administration-backed senatorial candidates in the southern Davao del Norte province. 'We just heard the other day, maybe they felt they stand no chance, that they will just kill 15 senators,' he said. 'That’s the problem when people think that the only solution is for them to kill their fellow Filipinos.' While Duterte’s officials often say the former leader’s utterances were never serious, thousands of suspected addicts and dealers had been killed during his six years in power from 2016-2022. Analysts said the Duterte family was using the political race to shore up support for the ex-president’s daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who may face an impeachment trial in the Senate in July for an alleged threat to assassinate Marcos Jr., his wife and the House Speaker. The Dutertes support the reelection bids of incumbent Sens. Ronald dela Rosa, who served as a police chief under the Duterte administration, and Christopher Go, the former aide of President Duterte. They are joined by Duterte’s spiritual adviser Apollo Quiboloy and outgoing Congressman Rodante Marcoleta, a staunch supporter of the Duterte family. Dela Rosa was the chief enforcer of Duterte’s controversial drug war while Quiboloy commanded the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC), a religious group that had grown in prominence and influence during Duterte’s presidency. He is campaigning from jail, where he is fighting sex trafficking charges, including minors. If they win in the May midterm elections, they are expected to protect Sara Duterte amid the impeachment process, analysts said. Earlier this month, Sara Duterte – the running mate of Marcos in the 2022 national elections – was impeached by the House of Representatives, who had accused her of violating the constitution, graft and corruption, plotting to assassinate Marcos as well as other high crimes. In response, the vice president said she won’t resign from her post as vice president and denied making an assassination threat against her former political ally. The Marcos and Duterte families are two of the country’s leading political families. They entered into an alliance to defeat the opposition in 2022, with Sara Duterte agreeing to run as a Marcos’ deputy. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately, part of a system of checks and balances built into the constitution. The alliance subsequently soured amid mounting pressure for Marcos to allow international prosecutors to investigate the former president on his drug war. The president initially said he would block International Criminal Court (ICC) investigators from entering the country to investigate, but later said they could carry out their own investigation here as well.

European Leaders Discuss Being Left Out From US-Russian Talks On ...	French President Emmanuel Macron hosted European leaders Monday for talks focused on the U.S. push to start Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, seemingly set to proceed without the involvement of European officials. The leaders of Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, along with NATO chief Mark Rutte, European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen began arriving in Paris for the hastily called meeting. The discussions came in the aftermath of last week’s phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two leaders agreed to start immediate talks to end Russia’s three-year war on its neighbor, but at least initially without the involvement of Ukrainian or European leaders. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Saudi Arabia where he is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Russian officials for discussions about the war. Rubio is being joined in the talks by two other key U.S. officials, Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce described the Riyadh discussions as 'a follow-up' to the Trump-Putin call but said, 'I don't think people should view this as something that is about details or moving forward in some kind of a negotiation.' It does not appear that any Ukrainian officials will join the talks, even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he will not accept a U.S.-Russian dictate on Ukraine’s future and that Ukraine must be involved in any settlement of the conflict. Russia now holds about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow unilaterally annexed in 2014 and much of eastern Ukraine. After arriving in Paris, von der Leyen said on X, 'Europe’s security is at a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine — but it is also about us. We need an urgency mind-set. We need a surge in defense. And we need both of them now.' European officials have expressed fear that Trump might pull U.S. troops out of Europe or negotiate an end to the Russian war on Ukraine on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. and European allies uniformly supported Ukraine and supplied them with billions of dollars’ worth of weaponry. Additionally, European officials were shocked last week by U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s speech in Munich in which he assailed Europe for excluding far-right groups from power and what it might portend for future U.S.-European relations. Meanwhile, Trump last year at a political debate declined to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war. More lately he has suggested that Ukraine hand over some of its rare earth minerals needed for U.S. technology manufacturing as compensation for the military aid Washington has supplied it. European leaders have in recent days pledged continued support for Ukraine, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying his government was ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force. 'I do not say that lightly,' he wrote Sunday in the Daily Telegraph. 'I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way.' Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter Putin from further aggression. Sweden’s Prime Minister Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Monday his country would not rule out contributing troops to a peacekeeping force that has a 'clear mandate.' The European Council’s Costa said last week’s Munich Security Conference showed the clear message that the security of Ukraine and the European Union 'cannot be separated.' 'There will be no credible and successful negotiations, no lasting peace, without Ukraine and without the European Union.' Costa said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday the Russian delegation at the Riyadh talks with the U.S. would include Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin. Even though the Riyadh talks are the first effort at ending the war since shortly after it began in 2022, Rubio told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' in an interview that aired Sunday, 'A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing.' 'We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, in a way that is sustainable and fair,' Rubio said. Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once 'real negotiations' begin, then Ukraine 'will have to be involved.' In an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that aired Sunday, Zelenskyy said, 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.' Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin is only pretending to want peace. 'I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is that he's ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he's a liar. He doesn't want any peace.’' Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support, 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult' to defeat Russia. 'And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance — low chance to survive without support of the United States.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adMxiu-GT8KMd	2025-02-17T15:25:58-08:00	
India’s Christians Splinter As Persecution Rises – OpEd	By John Singarayar (UCA News) -- The often-quoted phrase, 'Who will tie the cat?' aptly encapsulates the crisis of ecumenism in India today. Amid an increasing anti-Christian atmosphere under the shadow of Hindu majoritarianism, the body of Christ in India bleeds, not only from external wounds but also from self-inflicted fractures. Indian Christians, though a minority of 2.3 percent in a population of 1.4 billion, represent a mosaic of traditions: the ancient St. Thomas Christians claiming Apostolic history, Roman Catholicism shaped by Portuguese mission, Protestant denominations introduced by Western missionaries, and the 20th-century Pentecostal movements. The question is no more about Christian diversity or unity nor the threat to their survival amid Hindu majoritarianism. The vital question is about their moral accountability: If the Church is the embodiment of Christ, how does its fragmentation compound His suffering in a time of crisis? We need to critically examine the historical, theological, and socio-political dimensions of ecumenical failure in India, arguing that without confronting internal divisions, the Christian community risks further marginalization. Christianity’s arrival in India is traditionally dated to the St. Thomas mission in 52 AD. The ancient Syrian Christians, based in present-day Kerala, integrated into local caste structures and maintained distinct liturgical practices until Portuguese missionaries imposed the Latin rite system on them in the 16th century, sparking rebellion. More than five decades of rebellion resulted in the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653, pledging to reject Western missionaries and splitting the Church. Those joined to oppose the Portuguese further divided, now forming at least seven Kerala-based churches claiming St. Thomas tradition. The Catholic-Protestant theological mudslinging, their competition for converts among lower castes and tribal people, further fractured the Christian landscape. The Evangelical, Baptist, and Pentecostal movements arrived in the early 20th century, often funded by foreign agencies. Their proselytizing efforts among already Christian communities led to accusations of 'sheep-stealing.' These historical fissures, compounded by sociological identities such as caste, language, and ethnicities within churches, laid the groundwork for an often delayed and almost always divided response, or none at all, to issues Christians face. Since the rise of a common Hindu identity during pre-independence India, Hindu groups have been demanding laws against conversion saying Christian conversion destabilizes Indian society as it undermines the Hindu caste system. The Hindu-leaning Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), coming to political prominence and power with a thumping majority in 2014, has intensified anti-Christian rhetoric, framing conversions as a threat to national identity. The Hindu groups supporting the BJP took the election victory as a mandate to push their ideology of establishing a Hindu nation. Attacks range from mob violence — burning churches, assaulting worshippers — to bureaucratic harassment via anti-conversion laws in 12 states. These laws, requiring state approval for religious conversion, are weaponized to criminalize humanitarian work and communal worship. For instance, in Chhattisgarh, Pentecostal pastors face arbitrary arrests under false 'forced conversion' charges. The Uttarakhand High Court’s 2024 ruling mandating state scrutiny of religious practices further erodes constitutional freedoms. Persecution is also societal: tribal Christians or Dalit converts in Odisha face economic boycotts and social ostracization. Yet, the Christian response remains fragmented, reflecting theological and strategic divides. India’s ecumenical movement, embodied in the National Council of Churches in India (NCCI) and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI), has struggled to bridge denominational gaps. While the CBCI, representing 20 million Catholics, emphasizes dialogue with the government, mainstream Protestant bodies like the Church of North India (CNI) advocate legal resistance. Pentecostals, often independent, prioritize evangelism over institutional alliances, viewing persecution as spiritual warfare. This dissonance was obvious during the 2008 Kandhamal riots, where over 100 people were killed, mostly Christians. While Catholic institutions provided refuge, evangelical groups criticized the CBCI for 'compromising' with authorities. Similarly, during the 2023 Manipur violence, where Kuki tribals (mostly Christians) were targeted, denominational NGOs competed for relief funds, diluting advocacy. Theological differences and caste divisions continue to bleed the Body of Christ with a thousand cuts. External perceptions further complicate unity. Hindu nationalists paint Christianity as a 'foreign' faith despite its ancient Indian roots. In response, groups like the Syro-Malabar Church emphasize their swadeshi (indigenous) identity, distancing themselves from newer denominations. The 2008 Kandhamal anti-Christian riots exemplify ecumenical failure. After Hindu mobs targeted Christians, destroying 300 churches and 6,000 homes, the CBCI worked for rehabilitation. But evangelical bodies like the Global Council of Indian Christians (GCIC) publicized atrocities internationally, angering the federal government. Ecumenical bodies themselves are plagued by bureaucratic inertia and hierarchical rigidity. The NCCI, comprising 30 Protestant and Orthodox churches, struggles with denominational rivalries. The CBCI, though more centralized, prioritizes Catholic interests, often side-lining interfaith initiatives. Women and laypeople remain under-represented in leadership, stifling grassroots perspectives. The cost of fragmentation is stark. Politically divided, the tiny Christian community spread all across India cannot form a voting bloc. Socially, the absence of a unified narrative allows Hindu nationalists to stereotype Christians as either violent converts or foreign agents. Vulnerable groups, like Dalits and tribals, suffer disproportionately from their dual marginalization by caste and faith. The Body of Christ, segregated by caste, bleeds in silence. Internationally, India’s Christians fail to leverage global networks effectively, as seen in the muted response to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) downgrading India to the lowest tier in 2024. Yet, even in the valley of dry bones, hope flickers. The 2021 formation of the United Christian Forum (UCF) for human rights monitoring marks a tentative step toward collaboration. In Jharkhand, ecumenical coalitions successfully challenged anti-conversion laws in court. Theologians like Father Felix Wilfred urge re-imagining ecumenism beyond institutional mergers, focusing on shared ethical imperatives: defending democracy, aiding the poor, and promoting interfaith harmony. Grassroots movements, such as ecumenical prayer vigils during attacks, model solidarity. Digital activism, exemplified by the #NotSilent campaign during the Manipur violence, bridges denominational gaps among youth. Even the CBCI’s 2023 synod acknowledged caste as a 'sin against communion.' As Jesus Christ bleeds in the persecuted, the Indian Church faces a reckoning. Ecumenism cannot remain a polite dialogue among bishops; it must become a radical solidarity that dismantles caste, shares power and embraces vulnerability. The Hindu nation project of the BJP parental organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or national volunteers’ corps) thrives on Christian division; every denominational rivalry, every caste hierarchy, becomes a weapon against the Cross. To 'tie the cat,' the Church must confront its complicity in oppression — spiritual, casteist, and colonial. This demands more than joint statements; it requires a costly kenosis, a self-emptying model by Christ, who bled not for a faction but for all. The choice is clear: unity or irrelevance. In the shadow of the gallows, the Body of Christ must decide whether to heal — or to let the bleeding continue. In a nation where majoritarianism seeks to erase pluralism, Christians’ survival may hinge on their ability to rekindle the ecumenical spirit — not as a lofty ideal but as a pragmatic necessity.

Arabs Know Their History And Won’t Let It Be Repeated – OpEd	Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, said in a 2020 interview that he had 'read 25 books' on the Middle East. Such intellectual bravado would not matter if it were not for the fact that Kushner served as the president’s Middle East adviser during his first term and was essentially the main architect of Trump’s policies in the region. Trump’s successor did not fare any better, as the Biden administration largely adhered to Trump’s major mistakes and ultimately sustained the Israeli genocide, which killed — as per the latest estimates — more than 55,000. Joe Biden, too, proved to be a reader; although, unlike Kushner, he did not publicly brag about his intellectual prowess. On Nov. 29, a photo emerged of him holding a book by Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi entitled 'The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017.' Though American leaders and officials claim to base their decisions on a thorough understanding of the complexity of the Middle East, they are repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Trump has repeatedly insisted that the US will take ownership of Gaza, displace its population and turn their destroyed homeland into a real estate opportunity, while threatening them with 'hell' should they not follow his diktats. Trump is using such language based on the misguided idea that these threats will allow him to restore the political leverage that Washington lost over the course of its 15 months of blind support for the Israeli genocide in Gaza. No rational thinker, in the Middle East or beyond, would actually imagine a scenario in which Palestinians leave en masse due to Trump’s threats. They refused to do so after more than 85,000 tonnes of mostly US-supplied explosives were dropped on Gaza, destroying nearly all of the Strip. Empty threats will certainly not change that. Even though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist government have taken advantage of Trump’s words to repair, however temporarily, their struggling coalition, turning Trump’s supposed new doctrine on Gaza into a reality is impossible. Israel has, in fact, tried to create the circumstances that will lead, in the words of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, to the 'voluntary emigration' of Palestinians out of Gaza. Instead, on Jan. 27, nearly 1 million displaced Palestinians who had been driven to southern Gaza began their awe-inspiring march back to the north. It behooves the US administration to stop discounting history, as any wrong move or policy could lead to disastrous outcomes. Historically, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians has been the main objective of all Israeli policies, even before the establishment of the Israeli state on the ruins of historic Palestine in 1948. Aside from the immorality of that act, the pain of which continues to be felt by generations of Palestinian refugees, the event was catastrophic to the Middle East region as well. Aside from millions of refugees displaced in Palestine itself, millions more live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, other parts of the Middle East and around the world. Currently, there are nearly 6 million registered Palestinian refugees, according to UNRWA, though a large number remain unaccounted for. That political earthquake of 77 years ago remains one of the most decisive events that shaped, and continues to shape, the Middle East to this day. Its reversal will remain elusive unless justice finally prevails in Palestine — justice that is dictated by international and humanitarian laws, not impulsive statements from American officials. Jordan, Lebanon and Syria were the Arab countries that hosted most Palestinian refugees and whose political dynamics, as well as conflicts, were shaped by the mass displacement of Palestinians. Palestinian groups became part of the political fabric of these societies, sometimes becoming involved in internal struggles and sometimes being used to balance out existing demographic conflicts. Hardly a major event in the Middle East did not involve Palestinians, or the price of which was not disproportionately shouldered by them. Anyone who knows the fundamentals of modern Middle Eastern politics ought to know this. One can only imagine what would happen if 2.2 million more Palestinian refugees were pushed into Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries, as per Trump’s proposal. It would arguably be the most earth-shattering event in the region since the Nakba. No Arab government can possibly entertain such a scenario under any circumstances. While the prospects of another Gaza Nakba were born dead, the real worry is the fact that nearly 50,000 Palestinians have already been internally displaced in the West Bank. This ongoing ethnic cleansing is no less dangerous than the US-Israeli designs in Gaza. The uninformed US policy on Palestine, which continues to be led by the extremely dangerous policies of the politically bankrupt government of Netanyahu, is once again unifying the Arabs around a common cause. The Arabs know their history very well. It is time for them to prove to Israel that the lessons of history have been learned and will never be repeated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adG02XAMeMq0t	2025-02-17T15:20:34-08:00	
Assessing Trump’s Aggressive Deportation Goals: How Many Migrants...	One of the main themes of Donald Trump’s electoral campaign in the recent presidential elections has been immigration. Following his victory, Trump has begun implementing his action plan. One of his key proposals was the execution of mass deportations of immigrants. By Rut Bermejo Casado and Eric Sigmon Analysis 1. Introduction During the 2024 electoral campaign, Trump not only promised to restore some of his previous immigration policies, such as the creation of a ‘great wall’ on the southern border, but he also introduced new proposals to combat irregular immigration to the US. One of the most repeated claims was that he would carry out ‘the largest deportation operation in American history’. Thus, his plan is not only to work on the external dimension of migration control (particularly border controls or, in his words, ‘sealing the border’) but also to address the internal dimension, that is, to reduce the number of immigrants already within the country’s borders.[1] Although the concept of mass deportations appears to conflict with the very historical identity of the US as a nation of immigrants (Cornelius, Martin & Hollifield, 1994; Martin & Orrenius, 2022),[2] from the day of his inauguration, he began signing executive orders to implement a restrictive immigration policy designed by his trusted advisor, Stephen Miller, and to fulfil the promised deportations. Two main aspects of his immigration policy, particularly his deportation plan, are discussed below. First, the potential numerical scope of his plan is examined to answer the question: how many people are likely to be deported? Secondly, which individuals will be included in the operation? Although the well-known Republican policy platform, ‘Project 2025’, clearly states that his immigration policy objectives are to ‘secure the border, complete the construction of the wall, and deport illegal immigrants’, the lack of clarity regarding these aspects or even the contradictory statements were frequent during the electoral campaign. These grandiose, yet detail-lacking proposals, combined with an avalanche and overlapping of measures in the first two weeks of his Administration, make it difficult to ascertain the specifics. Both elements appear to be deliberate to ‘declare victory’ regardless of the outcome of his so-called ‘Operation Aurora’, as the lack of precise objectives prevents the assessment of his achievements. However, his response to how many and which ‘illegal’ immigrants are deported will determine not only the economic cost –which is expected to be high– but also the human cost for the immigrants themselves and the impact on the fundamental values and liberties of US democracy. This paper distinguishes, for analytical purposes, the questions of how many and which. However, both aspects are interconnected, and the response to one has an influence on the other. The total number of deported individuals is clearly linked and also determined by the second aspect: which ones will be deported? If the focus is placed on criminals, as Trump has occasionally said and as suggested by the first ‘detention operations’, that number will be lower than if it includes the entire population residing illegally in the US. 2. Deportations in the US immigration system President Trump’s statements regarding ‘Operation Aurora’ have recalled –indeed, he has explicitly referenced– President Eisenhower’s 1954 ‘Operation Wetback’ (García, 1981; Astor, 2009; Langham, 1992; Hernández, 2006). It is not clear how familiar he is with the operation or to what extent he considers it a model to follow; it may also simply be a nod related to his MAGA slogan, referencing the era that his movement holds as exemplary: the 1950s.[3] ‘Operation Wetback’ is, for many, one of the most shameful episodes in US democracy. This historical event has been described as follows: ‘Eisenhower’s mass deportation policy was a tragedy. Human rights were violated. People were transported to distant locations without food or water. Many unnecessary deaths occurred. On some occasions, even US citizens of Hispanic origin were deported. It was absurd. It was terrible. The immigrants were humiliated’. That operation involved the use of the military and was led by retired military officer Joseph Swing, who implemented it in the summer of 1954. One million young Mexicans were deported (Hernández, 2006), yet its effects in reducing irregular migration appear rather minimal, as many of those deported soon attempted to re-enter, some illegally and others legally. ‘Operation Wetback’ was not only aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants but also at redirecting their entry through legal channels, such as the ‘Bracero’ programme. The latter was designed to meet the demand for labour in specific sectors, requiring workers to meet established conditions to obtain temporary contracts. However, while the operation facilitated the return of some migrants through this system, it failed to curb irregular immigration, as many deportees continued to enter unlawfully. Thus, the operation can be assessed as a costly form of immigrant regularisation and an inefficient method for reducing irregular migration. As previously indicated, the primary target of the deportation operation was young, recently-arrived undocumented Mexican immigrants. Mexico cooperated closely with the US government, to the extent that it has been described as a ‘binational’ operation (Hernández, 2006). The reason for this intense and extensive cooperation was due to Mexico’s labour shortages and its desire to recover its young workforce (predominantly men). In addition to stopping the influx of undocumented Mexican workers, the operation also sought to dissuade employers from hiring them. However, resistance arose from certain legislators and agricultural and livestock industry groups that lobbied Congress. Many legislators opposed one of the initiative’s fundamental principles: penalising employers who hired undocumented workers, arguing that proving their knowledge of their employees’ immigration status would be difficult. Furthermore, some legislators were wary of Brownell’s militaristic approach, which proposed executing the plan as if it were a military invasion. Ultimately, Congress failed to pass legislation sanctioning employers who hired illegal workers but did approve increased funding for the Border Patrol. In summary, ‘Operation Wetback’ encountered legal and operational complications, as well as systematic violations of rights by authorities, including inhumane and degrading treatment, as well as torture. These factors, along with high costs and logistical difficulties, led to its swift termination. There is no doubt that Trump is no Eisenhower, nor is the context the same. Furthermore, certain details of the US immigration system, particularly deportation, have changed since then. Understanding how the system functions is crucial to grasping the new President’s capacity and possibilities for implementing his deportation programme. In the US the deportation or removal system generally requires obtaining a judicial decision for violating immigration laws. To refer to individuals returned to their country of origin following such a judicial resolution, the terms deportation, removal or return are used. It is estimated that in 2022 around 1,200,000 individuals had a final removal order that had not been executed because immigration authorities were unaware of their whereabouts or due to the government’s prosecutorial discretion not to enforce it. In cases where an immigration judge is involved, legal safeguards are clear. Even if the judge determines that a non-citizen may be deported, denies some kind of ‘relief from removal’ and issues a removal order or grants voluntary departure, the individual still has the right to appeal. The deportation order is only considered final if the 30-day period for filing an appeal expires without one being lodged, if the individual expressly waives the right to appeal, or if the Board of Immigration Appeals dismisses the appeal or upholds the deportation order.[4] This general system also includes expedited removals, which are primarily applied to individuals who have just crossed the border and entered the country, executed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Under the system established in 1996, these expedited removals bypass judicial authorisation if the deportation occurs within 14 days of entry for individuals apprehended within 100 miles of the land border unless the individual applies for asylum. These expedited removals, without judicial intervention, can also be applied to those who have been previously expelled (reinstatement of the removal order). The 2020 reform, under Trump’s first term, allowed the DHS to expel such individuals without a formal deportation order. That year expedited removals accounted for 41% of total deportations, while reinstated removal orders constituted 40%. The remaining 19% were determined by an immigration judge. The Trump Administration has once again modified expedited removals. The DHS has reversed the limitations imposed by Biden in 2022. With the new notification, the DHS has regained its authority to apply this procedure more broadly. The new regulation allows individuals without legal status to be subject to expedited deportation if they cannot prove they have been in the country for the previous two years, regardless of where they are found within the US. This measure has raised concerns among human-rights advocates and pro-immigrant organisations. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has criticised the expansion of expedited deportation, stating that this policy ‘leads to the deportation of individuals without due process and without the opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility to remain in the country’. Similarly, the American Immigration Council has warned that the lack of adequate judicial review could increase wrongful deportations, affecting immigrants with legitimate asylum claims or community ties in the US. Title 42 expulsions were also used during the pandemic, from March 2020 to May 2023. This legal provision allowed for swift expulsions of irregular immigrants seeking to enter the US based on public-health risks without requiring a formal interview, thus preventing individuals from seeking asylum. Trump initiated the use of Title 42 and Biden used it more than initially expected until he finally terminated it (Sigmon, 2024). The increasing use of expedited removals, including during the latter part of the Biden Administration, is linked to the termination of Title 42, as it seeks to ensure that immigrants can be deported swiftly without a court hearing if they do not apply for asylum. If immigrants processed under expedited removals apply for asylum, they must pass an initial screening interview with an asylum officer to avoid deportation and proceed with their case in the immigration system. 3. How many people can be deported under the new ‘Operation Aurora’? Although President Donald Trump has begun implementing his planned deportation programme immediately after taking office, one undetermined aspect is the numerical objective of his deportation initiative. In fact, during his campaign, Trump spoke of deporting 15 million or even up to 20 million people, despite estimates from the Pew Research Centerindicating that between 11 and 12 million undocumented immigrants reside in the US. In the case of ‘Operation Wetback’, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the legacy US immigration agency, reported deporting 1,100,000 individuals, though there is no consensus on the actual number, with some sources citing 200,000 people (Langham, 1992), others 1,000,000 (Hernández, 2006) and some suggesting as many as 1,300,000. In the US immigration system, over recent decades, resources for the enforcement of immigration laws have steadily increased, both at the border and within the interior, leading to a rise in deportations. Figure 1 shows the average annual deportations under the last five Administrations. The annual average of deportations increased from the Clinton Administration through Obama’s presidency. However, during Trump’s first term, deportations decreased due to reduced cooperation between state and local jurisdictions with ICE officials, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the government’s ability to detain and remove immigrants. This downward trend continued under the Biden Administration, which prioritised the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, as Obama had also done. Screenshot According to ICE data (see Figure 1), Obama deported more immigrants on average per year (385,000) than Clinton (143,000), Bush (252,000), Trump (299,000) and Biden (174,000). If these figures are broken down annually (see Figure 2), it is evident that during his previous term, despite promising to deport millions of immigrants, the highest number Trump achieved in a single year was 347,250 in fiscal year 2019. ICE’s highest one-year total was 432,228 in 2013 under President Obama. This figure helped to earn him the nickname ‘Deporter-in-Chief’. If Title 42 expulsions and expedited removals are included, Trump reached 393,000 deportations/expulsions in 2020, while Biden’s total reached 1,083,000 (adding up the three years –2021, 2022 and 2023– during which Title 42 remained in effect, reflecting his Administration’s reliance on Title 42. In total, from March 2020 to March 2023 more than 2.8 million immigrants were expelled from the US pursuant to Title 42. Screenshot Considering both these averages and the annual figures, even Vance’s estimate of deporting one million people per year seems quite difficult to achieve. Although it is still very difficult to determine how many people Trump will deport during his term, and how many he has effectively deported during his first week in office, some sources point to approximately 7,300 individuals. Of these, Mexico received 4,094 deportees from the US, the majority of them Mexican nationals, although individuals of other nationalities were also included. Undoubtedly, the operation that has received the most attention has been that of Colombia, which refused to receive two US military planes with approximately 200 Colombian deportees. However, military flights have been a minority thus far –around six– while deportations via commercial flights have been far more frequent. These deportations are attracting particular attention not so much due to their numbers, which some do not find abnormal, but rather because they are accompanied by raids[5] in sanctuary cities such as Miami or Chicago. ICE is also requiring state prisons to notify them before releasing detainees. This allows ICE to take custody of individuals and then place them in formal proceedings. 4. Who is being deported? A mass deportation, as anticipated under ‘Operation Aurora’, would be highly divisive, leading to family separations and potentially devastating effects on communities. It is estimated that, on a national level, more than 16.7 million people have at least one family member living with them in an irregular immigration situation. In fact, there are 5.9 million US children citizens who could potentially be at risk if these measures target their undocumented family members. The imagery of arrests within communities and family separations would be difficult to justify for a democracy like the US and would provoke strong opposition, such as the outcry during Trump’s first Administration against his ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy, which resulted in the separation of immigrant children from their parents.[6] Trump has spent months –if not years– laying the groundwork for this opposition, using rhetoric suggesting an invasion or a massive wave of immigration that would justify mass deportations,[7] drawing parallels with ‘Operation Wetback’ (Hernández, 2006). Mass deportation could even affect individuals with legal immigration status. Some expect that the operation will not indiscriminately include ‘any immigrant without legal status’ but will instead focus not on ‘how many’ but on ‘which ones’. There is a significant difference between prioritising the deportation of individuals serving criminal sentences or those in immigration detention –or, as the President insists, individuals in mental asylums– and deporting people who have been living in the US unlawfully for 20 or 30 years, with spouses or children who are US citizens. Trump has talked about targeting immigrants who entered via the humanitarian parole programme the Biden Administration implemented for certain Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans because he believes the programme was illegal. By this logic, he could also target the so-called ‘DACA children’ and individuals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS). It is worth remembering that, during his first term, Trump sought to end the DACA programme and eliminate TPS designations for certain nationalities. During his first week in office, Trump has emphasised the need to deport criminals, dangerous offenders and members of organised gangs. However, this could be merely the beginning: ‘the worst ones first’. Consistent with his focus on immigrants who have committed crimes, the first law he signed as President during his second term was the Laken Riley Act, approved the day after his inauguration, which expands the DHS mandate to detain any individual who is in the US illegally or lacks the necessary documents upon requesting admission and who has been accused, arrested, convicted or admitted to having committed acts that constitute the essential elements of burglary, theft, larceny or shoplifting. The Trump Administration has provided overall arrest figures for its first two weeks, but has not provided enough details to determine what proportion of the arrests were criminals or other details to help evaluate the kinds of operations ICE is conducting or the profiles of its targets. However, at the same time, reports of warrantless arrests have begun to emerge following the raids conducted during the first weekend in sanctuary cities such as Chicago and Miami. In this regard, Homan, known as Trump’s ‘border czar’, has reiterated that undocumented individuals apprehended during raids targeting criminals will also be deported. As with ‘Operation Wetback’, the majority of individuals being deported are of Mexican nationality. However, unlike that operation, this one will also include citizens from other countries, mainly Latin American. Additionally, while ‘Operation Wetback’ was primarily concentrated in the south-western US –starting at the California and Arizona borders before expanding to Texas’s southern border and later including Chicago (Langham, 1992)– the current US operations will be nationwide. Conclusions ‘Operation Aurora’ presents various challenges, which are examined in the second part of this paper –budgetary, operational, diplomatic, political and legal–. However, the first two weeks of President Trump’s Administration has already clarified some aspects regarding ‘how many people will be deported’ and ‘who will be affected’. The comparison with 1954’s ‘Operation Wetback’ highlights numerous similarities, whether intentional or coincidental, and underscores the risks of repeating historical mistakes. That policy not only resulted in significant human and economic costs but also proved ineffective in reducing irregular migration as it focused solely on mass deportation without offering viable pathways for regularisation. In the present context, where Trump has restricted legal migration pathways, a policy that combines ‘enforcement’ with regularisation could avoid these pitfalls and align with the principles of justice and humanity that should guide a democracy like the US. At present, it is not yet possible to describe this as a ‘mass deportation’. For some, the initial figures do not indicate an exceptional level of deportation activity. However, it remains to be seen how events unfold as the Administration’s efforts to pursue a mass deportation campaign present significant challenges, which will be analysed in the second part of this paper. Nevertheless, if the promised numbers are to be reached, the campaign will deeply impact social cohesion, employment in certain sectors (like agriculture and construction), human rights and the democratic values of the US. Moreover, images of family separations and mass arrests, detentions and deportations would be difficult to justify and support for an extended period of time in any 21st century democracy.

Donald Trump And North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Program – Analysis	By Ranjit Kumar Dhawan Introduction The Donald Trump administration after coming to power on 20 January 2025 expressed its desire to improve relations with the Kim dynasty regime in North Korea.[1] Notably, on the day after his inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, Trump termed North Korea a 'nuclear power' state, which caused apprehensions in South Korea.[2] However, during his meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba on 7 February 2025, Trump called for 'complete denuclearisation' of North Korea.[3] On the other hand, the North Korean regime has not yet responded to Trump’s gesture for restarting dialogue between the two countries. In the backdrop of the newly inaugurated second Trump administration, the Kim regime has been bolstering its nuclear weapons programme and has tested a more sophisticated cruise missile system. According to some analysts, Pyongyang will remain hostile towards the United States in 2025.[4] Also, contrary to the expectations of President Trump, North Korea would probably not give up its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Programme and the United States The enmity between North Korea and the US dates back to the Cold War period of intense ideological rivalry between capitalism and communism. The US played a key role in the division of the Korean Peninsula in 1945, and also militarily supported South Korea during the Korean War (1950–1953), which ended only with an armistice. The brutalities committed by the American army and threat to use nuclear weapons during the Korean War shaped North Korea’s approach towards the US. The American military bases on the Korean Peninsula and stationing of tactical nuclear weapons by the US in South Korea during the Cold War were also opposed by North Korea. In the post-Cold War period, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme gained momentum. The nuclear programme was guided by Pyongyang’s goal for achieving self-reliance or Juche in the field of national defence.[5] Despite being a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea secretly pursued the development of nuclear arsenal. In its pursuit of developing nuclear weapons technology, North Korea received some help from Pakistan.[6] Since 2006, North Korea has tested various kinds of nuclear devices, and has been developing long-range ballistic missiles which are apparently capable of reaching North America and could target the mainland US. The US has been strongly opposed to the North Korean nuclear weapons programme and has imposed severe economic sanctions against this reclusive regime. However, the fears of massive causalities and escalation of the conflict had deterred various administrations in the US to take pre-emptive strikes against the North Korean nuclear facilities. Remarkably, the previous Donald Trump administration in 2017 had even threatened to 'totally destroy' North Korea. But the three rounds of meetings between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during 2018–2019 remained unsuccessful. Notably, the current Trump administration has again pledged for North Korea’s denuclearisation. Why North Korea Will Not Denuclearise? A few days after the inauguration of the second Trump administration, the North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong-un made a visit to a secret weapons-grade nuclear materials manufacturing facility in North Korea, where he called for the reinforcing of the 'nuclear shield of the country'.[7] The North Korean state media also stated that the nuclear weapons of the country should not be regarded as a 'bargaining chip'.[8] Further, Kim Jong-un on the occasion of the 77th founding anniversary of the (North) Korean People’s Army on 8 February 2025, spoke about the threats from the US as the reason for bolstering North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.[9] Therefore, it appears that North Korea is not interested in negotiations with the US to curb its nuclear arsenal. Firstly, the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war since 2022 has provided useful lessons to the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang against denuclearisation. Also, North Korea and Russia signed a treaty on ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ for mutual defence in June 2024. As a result, the military engagement between Pyongyang and Moscow has increased significantly. Reportedly, North Korea has dispatched thousands of troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine, and has also provided Moscow with several tonnes of conventional weapons. In return, North Korea has apparently received rice, money and cutting-edge military reconnaissance satellite technology from Russia.[10] North Korea has also been treating Russian soldiers wounded in combat operations against Ukraine.[11] Also, there is a possibility that Moscow may even accept Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons development programme.[12] Secondly, the Trump administration’s approach for peace with North Korea has not been accompanied with any significant effort for reduction in tensions between the two countries. Evidently, the military exercises between the US and South Korea have continued unabated since Trump took office in January 2025. On the other hand, North Korea has continued to be critical of the US–South Korea military alliance, including sale of weapons to Seoul by Washington.[13] Also, the visit of an American nuclear-powered submarine to Busan in South Korea in February 2025 triggered angry response from North Korea.[14] Moreover, the comment by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio regarding North Korea as a 'rogue state' was also vehemently criticised by Pyongyang.[15] Thirdly, North Korea’s relations with South Korea have undergone profound changes since 2024. The Kim dynasty regime in North Korea has abolished the idea of reunification of the Korean Peninsula, and has probably amended its constitution to regard South Korea as a 'hostile state'.[16] North Korea has also destroyed roads and railway links with South Korea as part of Pyongyang’s ‘two hostile states’ policy.[17] Therefore, South Korea is now a ‘separate and enemy’ country for North Korea. Arguably, this strategy of Pyongyang towards Seoul is to push South Korea to compromise and accept North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.[18] Conclusion The rapidly developing nuclear capabilities of North Korea have been an issue of deep concern to the US. This also reflects the failure of all previous American administrations to get rid of the North Korean nuclear arsenal. The advent of the second Trump administration has raised hopes for a solution on this issue. However, there has not been any major shift in Trump’s policy towards the North Korean nuclear weapons programme. For its part, the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang has been strengthening its nuclear weapons capabilities and has been critical about the policies of second Trump administration. Therefore, it appears that North Korea’s denuclearisation shall remain only a propaganda campaign for the US and Pyongyang would not abandon its nuclear weapons programme.

Syria: A Larger Lebanon Or A Signal For Major Geopolitical Change...	By General (Rtd) Corneliu Pivariu I. Brief History Syria, under French mandate after World War I, gained independence in 1945, subsequently experiencing a highly turbulent political and social period marked by numerous military coups until 1970, when General Hafez Al-Assad seized power through a coup. A referendum in the spring of 1971 legitimized his leadership, establishing an autocratic rule based on the military and secret services, widely supported by his Alawite coreligionists (a minority), who held the most important positions in the power structures. The natural passing of Hafez Al-Assad in 2000, one of the longest-serving heads of state in the Middle East, was linked by many analysts to the beginning of Syria’s decline in regional influence. His successor, his son Bashar, assumed power instead of his elder brother Basel, who had been groomed for leadership but died in a tragic car accident in Lebanon. Retaining his father’s loyal supporters, Bashar managed to stay in power for nearly 24 years, until December 8, 2024, when he fled to Moscow. Ultimately, the London-trained ophthalmologist failed to effectively manage the external and internal challenges he faced, exacerbated by severe mistakes made by his close circle and the shifting geopolitical landscape. The phrase popular in Damascus in the 2010s—'The West needs Bashar al-Assad more than Bashar needs the West'—gradually lost its validity due to the regime’s serious errors and changing international attitudes toward Damascus. II. Syria and the Arab Spring In Syria, the Arab Spring (or rather, the Arab Winter) emerged later than in North Africa, where protests and political upheavals began in 2010. The onset of Syrian unrest, which gradually escalated into a long and bloody civil war[2], is traced to March 15, 2011, following earlier protests in Dara, a southern Syrian city near the Jordanian border. The Assad regime mishandled these protests, employing heavy-handed repression, particularly through the Republican Guard led by Bashar’s brother, Maher Al-Assad. Popular discontent was further fueled by the presence of several hundred infiltrators from abroad, carrying passports from a neighboring country, between January and March 2011. This signaled an external decision to remove Assad, reinforced by substantial financial and material support from Arab states such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Despite the regime’s powerful secret services, which recruited followers from an early age, protests became violent across nearly the entire country. Armed intervention against demonstrators led to the radicalization of the movement. Due to Syria’s unique social situation and the government’s intelligence operations, opposition groups fragmented into various factions, including armed groups like the Free Syrian Army, which failed to unify into a single force. Extremist organizations such as Daesh (ISIS) exploited the ensuing chaos to seize control of different regions. The situation was further complicated by the involvement of international actors such as Russia (from 2015), Iran (from the beginning, both militarily and through Hezbollah), Turkey, and the U.S.-led coalition, each pursuing distinct geopolitical interests. Mass desertions weakened the Syrian army, which, except for its elite commando units and the Republican Guard, was generally poorly trained. Alongside foreign military presences—Russia and Iran being crucial in securing strategic areas—the regime also established local paramilitary formations such as the Shabiha ('ghosts'), primarily composed of Alawite minorities who maintained control, especially along the coast, where their population was significant. To survive, the regime employed all available means, from airstrikes using fragmentation bombs to chemical weapons. Prisons became overcrowded with opposition members detained for the slightest act of defiance. From a demographic perspective, the war was catastrophic, causing over 500,000 deaths, more than 6 million external refugees, and around 4 million internally displaced persons. Material destruction is difficult to estimate, with figures reaching approximately $300 billion. Between 2011 and 2023, the Syrian economy shrank by 85%. The regime survived largely due to Iranian support, estimated at $2-6 billion annually. Another financial lifeline was the production of Captagon, an illicit drug known as the 'jihad drug,' generating over $10 billion for the Assad regime. In late November 2024, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham[3] (HTS) – Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, which controlled Syria’s northwestern Idlib region, launched an offensive against key strategic points, capturing Aleppo within days, followed by Hama, Homs, and finally Damascus. The Syrian Civil War formally ended on December 7, 2024, following a meeting in Doha involving Arab foreign ministers and the Astana Process for Syria. They signed a Joint Declaration [4] endorsing a ceasefire based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254. On December 8, 2024, Bashar al-Assad fled from Damascus to Latakia and was evacuated to Moscow from Russia’s Hmeimim military airbase. III. The Fall of the Assad Regime, Current Developments, and Perspectives The fall of the Assad regime was driven by a combination of internal and external factors that reached a critical point towards the end of 2024. Nevertheless, the regime demonstrated remarkable resilience, though the worsening economic and social crisis heightened the risks of regime change. Key external factors included Israel’s desire to capitalize on developments in Gaza and Lebanon to minimize Iran’s influence in Syria, as well as the situation of the Russian Federation, which, being engaged in the conflict in Ukraine, was unwilling to intensify its military support for Bashar al-Assad, thereby accepting his departure within a broader geopolitical context The Assad family was not entirely caught off guard[5], having taken precautions from the early years of the civil war to secure a comfortable life in Russia. Bashar shared his plans to flee Syria with almost no one, misleading his advisors, officials, and even relatives about his real intentions. His brother, Maher—commander of the Republican Guard—departed by helicopter to Iraq and then flew to Moscow. On December 8, the armed opposition announced the fall of the regime, and the acting Prime Minister, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, declared his willingness to hand over power to a transitional government. On December 10, Ahmed al-Sharaa[6], the emir of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who became the de facto head of state, appointed Mohammed al-Bashir as Prime Minister of the Salvation Government. Initially consisting of 12 members from the previously established government in Idlib, the cabinet was expanded by six members on December 21, and the first female minister was appointed a day later. On December 30, Maysaa Sabreen was appointed as the first female governor of the Central Bank of Syria, having previously served as the first deputy governor of the bank during the latter part of the Assad regime. On January 29, 2025, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) held the 'Victory Conference' in Damascus, officially naming Ahmed al-Sharaa as interim president. He was tasked with forming an interim legislative council to draft a new constitution. In a five-minute speech, Sharaa outlined his five priorities: resolving the power vacuum; maintaining civil peace and preventing acts of revenge[7]; rebuilding state institutions, particularly the military, security, and police forces, to ensure public safety; revitalizing the economy by rebuilding human resources, agriculture, industry, and the service sector; and regaining Syria’s regional position by establishing foreign relations based on sovereignty, respect, and mutual interests. Aware of the difficulties ahead, al-Sharaa remarked, 'The first moment of victory can be the first moment of defeat.' In defense, initial steps were taken as 18 larger and around 50 smaller armed factions agreed to dissolve and integrate into the new army. However, two armed factions in the south, from Suwayda and Daraa, as well as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which control a significant area in northeastern Syria, have not yet accepted integration. The SDF, of Kurdish origin and allied with the U.S., maintains ties with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, which seeks to eliminate it. Economic reconstruction is estimated to take at least ten years for Syria’s GDP to return to its 2010 level ($80 billion), compared to just $10 billion in 2023. In 2019, reconstruction costs were estimated at approximately $400 billion, likely exceeding $500-600 billion today. The new Minister of Economy has promised a transition to a free, competitive economy, abandoning the centralized control model. Although the U.S. and the EU are expected to lift most, if not all, economic sanctions, massive investments will be required for reconstruction, making it a fundamentally political issue. Countries financing reconstruction will play a crucial political role in Syria’s future. Despite expressing interest, Iran and Russia are unlikely to play a dominant role due to their internal and geopolitical circumstances. Given Syria’s new power dynamics, Turkey is in the most advantageous position. Turkish exports to Damascus were worth $2 billion in 2023, and given Ankara’s support for HTS, Turkey is likely to become the primary investor in reconstruction. The Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan’s visit to Damascus on December 22, 2024, signaled not only political-military but also economic intentions. By late January 2025, President Erdogan stated that Turkey alone could eradicate terrorist groups in Syria, implying its desire for a leading role in the country. In this context, the revival of the Turkey-Qatar gas pipeline project, first proposed in 2009 and abandoned due to political difficulties, including the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, is worth noting. The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani’s visit to Damascus on January 30, 2025—the first by an Arab head of state since Assad’s fall—further underscores Qatar’s interest in Syria’s future. Apart from general discussions on post-war collaboration, Qatar provided 200 MW of electricity, with plans for gradual expansion. Another crucial issue is securing Syria’s oil supply, which was 90% dependent on Iran before deliveries ceased following Assad’s fall. Additionally, Hezbollah’s oil trafficking routes from Lebanon were bombed by Israel, forcing Syria to seek alternative sources. Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and even Iraq are being considered for this purpose. Iran evacuated its personnel from Syria shortly before the regime’s fall but remains open to cooperation with the new authorities. Iran still has significant influence through its supporters in Syria, which it can leverage to advance its interests. Although initially stating its intention to maintain good relations with Moscow, the new Syrian government has annulled Russia’s 49-year lease of the Tartus naval base. A visit by Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister to Damascus in late January failed to resolve the issue, and Russian military equipment has begun to be evacuated by sea. However, Syria will need to maintain some level of normal relations with Russia, considering their historical ties and future dependencies. Syria’s external debt to Russia exceeds $15 billion, primarily for military procurement, and its armed forces rely on Russian technology, making a shift to alternative suppliers a long-term process. Moreover, Russia’s long-standing advisory presence in Syria’s security and defense sectors remains a strategic advantage for Moscow. The U.S. has shown interest in Syria’s developments, evidenced by a State Department delegation’s visit to Damascus shortly after Assad’s fall. The U.S. maintains around 2,000 troops in northeastern Syria, supporting the SDF, a stance opposed by Turkey. After December 8, 2024, the U.S. reportedly expanded Ain al-Assad airbase in western Iraq to serve as a logistics hub for American bases in the region. Additionally, it allegedly secured agreements for three new bases in Damascus, Daraa, and Quneitra, while expanding the Hasakah base. I personally believe that the regime change in Syria was linked to the changes underway in the Washington Administration, in order to align with the new intentions of the Trump administration in the Middle East, with Syria potentially playing an important role in the security architecture envisioned by the new American administration for the region. Israel was an active participant in the evolution of the situation in Syria and took advantage of the circumstances that emerged after December 8, 2024, to carry out over 400 air strikes against Iranian targets, Hezbollah, and the Syrian military—destroying missile and ammunition depots, striking the most important points of Syria’s anti-aircraft defenses and radar installations, and sinking a large part of the Syrian military fleet. Israel justified its actions as preventive, to ensure that the respective weaponry and military equipment would not be captured by terrorists. Furthermore, immediately after December 8, it proceeded to completely occupy the heights of the Golan as well as Mount Hermon (2,814 m), the highest in the area, overlooking Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. 'It is extremely important from a strategic point of view. There is no substitute for mountains,' explained Efraim Inbar, Director of the Institute for Strategy and Security in Jerusalem (JISS). Although Israel officially declared that it would not retain these territories, I doubt that it will not, in the not-too-distant future, proclaim the annexation of the entire Golan plateau and maintain control over Mount Hermon, where it could install specialized equipment for military electronic reconnaissance (if such equipment has not already begun to be installed). At present, I do not believe that Israel has established a long-term policy towards the new regime in Syria, given the multiple possible political scenarios regarding the developments in that country. Potentially, a normalization of relations between Syria and Israel could open new economic prospects, particularly in the energy sector for Israel. Ahmad al-Sharaa and the interim government established in Damascus face particularly heavy and complex challenges both domestically and internationally. The transition period is estimated to last around three years, after which a new constitution must be approved by referendum, followed by elections in the fourth year. The issues that the new government will confront are very different from the administration of a region such as Idlib, where errors were also made. Regarding the medium- and long-term evolution of the situation in Syria, I believe it can be grouped into two main scenarios, each with several variants: either Syria remains within its current territory—with some modifications in the Golan area that will be entirely annexed by Israel—or Syria is partially or completely divided (the latter being the least likely variant), depending on the evolution of the internal situation and the negotiations between various regional powers and global actors. In the event of a division, Turkey is best positioned, as it would like to bring under its control the area in the north, from immediately north of Latakia, through Aleppo and along the Euphrates to the border with Iraq. The coastal area, where the Alawite minority is predominant, could declare independence and come under the umbrella of Moscow, thereby saving its maritime bases in the Mediterranean. Jordan, as a maximalist plan, might lay claim to expand its territory even as far as Damascus, taking into account the historical traditions of the Hashemite dynasty, or only as far as Daraa and Suwayda. This, too, will depend on developments in Gaza. Of course, Israel will take the entire Golan as well as Mount Hermon. Will Ahmad al-Sharaa, at the age of 43, be able to successfully lead Syria through the transition period and subsequent reconstruction? Determination alone is not enough; the way in which internal and external factors will interweave, as well as how he will seize emerging opportunities, will determine the final outcome of Syria’s evolution in the first half of the 21st century. IV. Brief Conclusions The fall of the Assad regime in less than a month after nearly 14 years of civil war is a clear indication that regional and global geopolitical shifts in the second quarter of the 21st century will be more significant than before. The possibility of border modifications worldwide is no longer far-fetched. In the Middle East, Israel and Turkey emerge as the main winners, though each faces internal and external challenges. Syria’s situation remains highly complex and open to various possibilities. The new government must tackle a deepening economic and social crisis while preventing a descent into factional conflict, reminiscent of Lebanon’s historical turmoil. Syria’s developments will shape new regional and global power balances, potentially becoming the new litmus test for Middle Eastern and even global geopolitics.

Previously, in 2011, HTS was known as Jabhat al-Nusra and was affiliated with Al-Qaeda. It also had ties with the Islamic State, but these affiliations were severed with the formation of HTS. The organization has been designated a terrorist group by the UN, the US, Turkey, the EU, and other states. HTS controlled the northwestern region of Syria, known as the Idlib region, as well as parts of the Aleppo area, including the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. It established a Salvation Government composed of 10 ministers. The organization has received increased support from Turkey over the past year, including drones, military instructors, and weaponry. Additionally, it benefits from support from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, other Arab and non-Arab countries, and wealthy opponents of the Assad regime who have taken refuge abroad.

[5] According to the Financial Times, as early as 2019, the extended Assad family purchased 19 apartments in Moscow’s modern commercial center, valued at $40 million. The US State Department estimated in 2022 that the Assad family’s wealth was approximately $2 billion, spread across numerous accounts, shell companies, real estate portfolios, and tax havens.

At the age of six, he returned with his family to Damascus. Shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he joined Al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he fought for three years before being captured by American forces and imprisoned in various locations from 2006 to 2011. His release coincided with the start of the Syrian civil war, during which he established the Al-Nusra Front to support Al-Qaeda's fight against Bashar al-Assad’s Ba'athist regime. In 2013, he was placed on the US State Department's terrorist list, and four years later, a $10 million reward was set for information leading to his capture. In December 2024, the reward was canceled following his meeting with a US State Department delegation visiting Damascus.On July 28, 2016, al-Sharaa announced that Al-Nusra was severing ties with Al-Qaeda and renamed the organization Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS). In January 2017, he formed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) by merging with other groups. He prioritized combating Al-Qaeda and Daesh to improve relations with the West, particularly with Turkey, and succeeded in controlling most of the Idlib region, which he governs through the Syrian Salvation Government. [7] Reports have already surfaced of summary executions of approximately 35 people in central Homs and another 10 people in the Alawite area, from which the Assad family originates.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRRTRL8PLYtsU	2025-02-16T17:20:54-08:00	
Why India Matters To Singapore – Analysis	By Fiona Raval President of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam concluded a four-day state visit to India on 18 January 2025. The first Indian tour by a Singaporean president in a decade, it commemorated the 60th anniversary of India and Singapore establishing bilateral ties. This high-level visit follows the one made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Singapore in September 2024, when the two countries elevated ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP). India and Singapore have maintained amicable relations with strong economic and trade ties over the years. Singapore has been one of India’s foremost trading partners and its top Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) contributor. As of 2023-24, Singapore was India’s largest trade partner in ASEAN, with petroleum products, electronic machinery, coal, and ships being the most traded items. The two countries also have a sound defence partnership which manifests through joint drills, exercises, regular ministerial dialogues, and association in equipment manufacturing. 2024 onwards New Delhi and Singapore have seen a still further uptick in bilateral ties. From a Singaporean perspective, this growing partnership results from a combination of national and regional considerations that reflect its evolving strategic interests. What are the specific factors driving this robustness? Bilateral Incentives India-Singapore ties are primarily based on trade, commerce, and people-to-people linkages. In 2023-24, bilateral trade reached around US$ 35.62 billion. The annual compound growth rate of total trading volume since 2019-20 has been around 10.75 per cent, with the balance in Singapore’s favour. This relationship has been facilitated by the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), a Free Trade Agreement signed in 2005. The CECA reduces tariffs, protects FDI, and boosts market access. Additionally, it enhances cooperation in areas like knowledge-sharing, education, and skill-building, while also easing visa restrictions and recognising qualifications to allow easier exchange of professional talent. The relationship recently progressed to a CSP following CECA’s success. This endeavour reaffirms existing collaborations but also opens doors to new and emerging areas like healthcare, semiconductors, digital technologies, and sustainability. There is also hope that the CSP can help address the problem of reduced FDI flow into India. Although Singapore is the top contributor, its overall investments have seen sharp decline in the past year. Collaborative skill development and exchange of skilled labour further strengthens bilateral relations between India and Singapore. Singapore has long depended on foreign workers due to its small population size and shortage of native manpower. As of 2024, around 6,50,00 Indians were living in Singapore. Indians are a major source of the low wage migrant workforce in Singapore, with Indian Employment Pass holders nearly doubling between 2005 and 2021. This workforce also contributes to the rising demand of finance and tech-centric jobs at multinational companies that have set up shop in Singapore. Without this labour, the Singaporean economy, which depends on multinational corporations for 73 per cent of its corporate tax, would take a significant hit. This is why technical education and skill development are important areas of collaboration. In fact Singapore has associated with several Indian states for such initiatives, such as setting up the North-East Skill Centre in Guwahati, Assam, and the World Skill Centre in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. These efforts allow Singapore to capitalise on India’s demographic dividend by making people more employable. For example, the winners of the Singapore India Hackathon were incentivised by potential job opportunities at the Singaporean DSB Bank. While advantageous to its economy, the rise in foreign workers has also caused strains within Singapore. Singaporean natives have grown to resent foreigners for allegedly stealing professional opportunities. Indians face racial and xenophobic abuse in Singapore, where ‘CECA’ is used as a slur for Indian workers. In the absence of punitive action, the discrimination has not stemmed. The Singaporean government has however made statements saying that this nature of abuse won’t be tolerated, that economic agreements, including the CECA, don’t grant favour for employment. Singapore’s ongoing investments in Indian skill-building and the induction of Indians into its workforce underscore how vital this sector is to its economy. On the flipside, local hostility towards foreign workers from India continues to be a significant concern, though the Indian government is yet to raise the issue with Singaporean counterparts. Regional Drivers As a small country, Singapore’s success and stability depend on its partnerships and ability to adapt to major power competition. Despite Singapore’s longstanding and meaningful relations with both the US and China as well as deft attempts to walk the foreign policy tightrope, some problems persist. Regional flux has manifested in the form of protectionist trade practices, which create exclusion and hurt Southeast Asian economies. It has also increased competition in areas of key and emerging technologies. Always a proponent of regional collaboration, Singapore has highlighted the need to create diverse multilateral partnerships so as to not get caught in geopolitical crossfire. Singapore has adapted to the flux created by major power competition by diversifying and strengthening other relationships. In this light, expanding areas of collaboration with India is a strategic move to create dependable ecosystems in the region. For example, the India-Singapore semiconductor deal tries to bridge supply chain gaps created post the COVID-19 pandemic and to insulate from the impacts of China's stance against Taiwan. This not only adjusts to regional changes but also creates new opportunities by giving Singapore greater market access. Other areas of collaboration include setting up a green energy corridor to cooperate on critical and emerging technologies. This will achieve India and Singapore’s joint goal of sustainable development, and facilitate greater visibility for Singapore as a regional lead in clean technology. As a strong supporter of multilateralism, Singapore had thrown its weight behind ASEAN’s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). India’s sudden decision to opt out of RCEP negotiations in 2019 was thus met with concern. This concern was reportedly exacerbated when India was perceived as repositioning itself away from ASEAN. Singapore’s strategic position as a gateway to Southeast Asia plays a key role in ensuring ASEAN remains a priority for India. Given the unceasing crisis in Myanmar, this partnership as well as India’s active involvement in ASEAN become even more urgent. New Delhi and Singapore have significant investments and economic interests in Myanmar and share a common goal of maintaining peace in the ASEAN region. India’s participation is needed for developing a comprehensive and durable solution to the crisis, especially when ASEAN’s 5-point consensus has failed to make a difference. India’s Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that Myanmar was a topic of discussion during this presidential visit. Conclusion In their 60 years of partnership India and Singapore have maintained steadfast relations. The past year has seen a positive escalation in the relationship, with a deepening of ties through a blend of bilateral and regional strategic considerations. Bilaterally, CECA has helped further bolster trade and economic linkages and opened new pathways to cooperation, such as digital technologies. While racial tensions are an active concern, the high volume of labour and expertise flowing into Singapore also emphasises a critical interdependency. Regionally, Singapore's efforts to diversify partnerships due to major power competition further drive its engagement with India. This new phase in their partnership is not just to foster mutual growth and stability but is an acknowledgement of shifting global dynamics and an effort to navigate them jointly.

Sri Lanka Struggles To Deliver A New Era Of Post-Crisis Growth – ...	By Ganeshan Wignaraja Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP) government, led by the charismatic President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, entered office in late 2024 at a turning point in the country’s economic history. Sri Lanka experienced its worst post-independence economic crisis in 2022–23. While the economy is now stabilising, the challenges are far from over. The new government is struggling to balance economic growth with debt sustainability. Sri Lanka’s economic outlook offers cause for cautious optimism. The combination of prudent monetary and financial stability policy by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, fiscal policy reforms, a US$3 billion International Monetary Fund program and US$4 billion of Indian assistance appears to have steadied the economy after severe macroeconomic turbulence. A debt restructuring deal of US$17.5 billion reached with private bondholders and China gave Sri Lanka the breathing room it desperately needed, while earnings from tourism have accelerated, contributing to the recovery of foreign exchange reserves. The October 2024 World Bank growth forecasts point to growth slowing from a forecast 4.4 per cent in 2024 to 3.5 per cent in 2025. Despite a stabilising economy, over half the country’s population is experiencing what the UNDP terms multidimensional vulnerability to their standard of living. While the economic outlook is positive, there are risks that the new government will need to tackle head-on. One of the most pressing issues is the outflow of skilled professionals. Sri Lanka has seen a significant brain drain with over 300,000 people leaving Sri Lanka for foreign employment in 2024 alone. The country faces an ever-shrinking talent pool — talent which is desperately needed to propel growth. The newly elected parliament has little experience, as the country struggles with the repercussions of the brain drain. Of the 225 members of parliament, about 150 are untested first-term representatives. This raises questions about whether Sri Lanka’s politicians have the legislative and technical capacity needed to enact the economic reforms Sri Lanka so desperately needs. The government will need to focus on improving service delivery, retaining key talent within the state sector and developing expertise in governance and public administration. Sri Lanka will have to rejuvenate the elite cadre of the civil service by establishing a top-quality public policy school akin to The Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy or France’s Sciences Po. Tourism — which has long been a critical sector for Sri Lanka — is showing strong recovery, with significant potential to boost foreign exchange reserves and spur growth. Over 2 million touristsvisited Sri Lanka in 2024, a 38 per cent increase over 2023. But the government has to do more to ensure that the tourism industry is sustainable and its economic benefits extend beyond the capital, Colombo. Marketing Sri Lanka as a multicultural destination, coupled with targeted development of less-visited regions in the north and east of the country and small tourism businesses, will help create a more balanced and decentralised tourism industry. Fiscal sustainability is one of the most contentious issues facing the new government. While revenue has increased due to higher taxation, further reducing government spending and exposure to corruption risks are powerful means of reducing fiscal imbalances. Despite ruling out privatisation, the government plans to turn around state-owned enterprises through better management. But some of the larger loss-making state-owned enterprises — such as SriLankan Airlines and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation — should be reconsidered for privatisation or restructuring, as their drain on public funds threatens Sri Lanka’s long-term fiscal stability. With the support of international financial institutions, the government should pursue a strategy that right-sizes the state, encourages private-sector growth and ensures fiscal health in the coming years. Sri Lanka’s foreign policy choices are vexed. The geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific are dramatically changing after US President Donald Trump resumed office, with India emerging as a key player in Sri Lanka’s economic future. The government must strengthen economic ties with India and its southern states, ensuring that Sri Lanka benefits from Indian investments and partnerships. President Dissanayake will have to live up to his promises of non-interference in India’s security concerns, particularly given China’s increasing commercial presence in Sri Lanka. President Dissanayake’s visit to India in December 2024 was a promising foundation for stronger bilateral relations. The government must now focus on making concrete progress, particularly in business-to-business links, digitisation, cross-border energy projects and the deeper bilateral free trade agreement now under negotiation. Sri Lanka faces a serious risk of having to make capital repayments on its external debt in mid-2027 if it cannot increase its foreign exchange reserves through trade-led growth. In partnership with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, India should stand ready to help if Sri Lanka falters a second time. The new Sri Lankan government will need a comprehensive growth plan that addresses both immediate risks and long-term opportunities. Navigating these choppy waters will require pragmatic leadership, bold policy decisions and a clear vision for Sri Lanka’s future prosperity. The publication of the national budget in mid-February 2025 will provide important insights into the NPP administration’s economic plans.

Spring Is In The Air In US-Russia Ties As Trump’s Revolution Gain...	What emerges from the dramatic happenings of the past week is that the 3-year chronicle of US-Russia rivalry and the NATO’s proxy war in Ukraine was a crisis engineered with great deliberation by the Anglo-American nexus per a pernicious agenda conceived by the neocon liberals wedded to globalism ensconced in the Washington and London establishment to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. In less than a month since President Donald Trump returned to Oval Office, in a series of bold moves, he began dismantling the Iron Wall that descended on Central Europe. Its impact is already visible, as communication channels with Moscow have been flung open, as evident in the new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Saturday and their agreement to meet at delegation level in Saudi Arabia next week. The Trump administration will allow the resumption of normal diplomatic work as well as discuss the early return of diplomatic properties unilaterally seized by the Obama – Biden administrations in wanton acts of motiveless malignity and hubris, in violation of Vienna accords. Trust Russia to reciprocate! The downstream salience of the readouts in Moscow and Washington, here and here, on the Rubio-Lavrov phone conversation is the mutual agreement between the two leaderships — Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin — for US-Russian interactive exchanges at various levels is being followed through with a view to improve bilateral relations as well as 'on key international issues, including the situation in Ukraine, developments in Palestine and the broader Middle East, as well as other regional matters.' Furthermore, a team designated by the White House comprising apart from Rubio, the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and the president’s Middle East envoy (who also works on Ukraine-Russia issues) Steve Witkoff will meet a Russian team led by Lavrov as early as this week ahead. The inclusion of Witkoff, a ‘result-oriented’, pushy negotiator and old friend of Trump is particularly interesting. Witkoff flew into Moscow for an unpublicised solo visit last week, which appears to have been productive. Clearly, Trump has drawn lessons from this first term and is determined not to get emasculated again in the Washington ‘swamp’. This is where Witkoff comes in. Trump’s approach and political style is utterly fascinating. Trump began shifting gear no sooner than he managed to put together a team of like-minded people who are 'loyalists' to head the Justice Department, Pentagon, the Treasury, etc. — and, importantly, to forcefully regenerate the authority of the attorney general and the national intelligence agency to serve his agenda. Thus, in the final analysis, it is immaterial that his administration is packed with pro-Israel figures or has a sprinkling of hardliners on China. For, it is Trump who will call the shots. Surprises could be in store in policy twists and turns. This should already give sleepless nights to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu whom Trump has sensitised apropos his intention to improve relations with Iran. To my mind, Trump may not even follow through his dramatic announcement of 'taking over' Gaza, et al. The pattern appearing with regard to relations with Russia is that Trump levels with Putin first and passes down decisions to the state department and other agencies to follow through. Equally, the mechanism of summitry is being revived as the locomotive of big power relations. There is already talk of Trump holding summit meetings with Putin in Saudi Arabia and with Xi Jinping. Trump will likely look for a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at some point. Such an approach necessitates cutting down the role and influence of the Deep State which had throttled Trump’s presidency through the 2016-2020 period. The challenge facing Trump is formidable, given the nexus between the Democratic Party and the Deep State, and the mischief potential of mainstream media which is largely under their control and hostile towards Trump. In a glaring instance this week, Wall Street Journal deliberately misrepresented certain remarks by Vice-President JD Vance to vitiate the air in the nascent US-Russia tango. According to the story, Vance allegedly stated that the US might use economic and military leverage against Russia, and the option of sending the US military to Ukraine 'remains under consideration' in case Moscow refuses to resolve the conflict in good faith. Moscow immediately sought clarification and a rebuttal had to be issued by Vance himself to set the record straight. Vance wrote on X: 'The fact that the WSJ twisted my words in the way they did for this story is absurd, but not surprising considering they have spent years pushing for more American sons and daughters in uniform to be unnecessarily deployed overseas.' Trump has repeatedly expressed distrust of US intelligence agencies. According to CNN, all employees (approx. 22,000 people) at the CIA have received letters whereby they are given two options: to continue his/her service without guarantees of job retention in the future or to leave under the so-called deferred dismissal program at own request, while retaining salary and additional preferences until end-September. Interestingly, a code was sewn inside these letters that tracks the re-sending of the letter by the recipient, as a guarantee against leaks which was the practice used when dismissing employees of the former Twitter after its acquisition by billionaire Elon Musk, who is now considered one of Trump’s closest advisers and heads the quasi-Department of Government Efficiency overseeing the reduction of federal government! Again, the disbandment of USAID, which traditionally worked as the 'B Team' of the CIA to promote colour revolutions and regime changes, etc. can also be seen in the light. According to Vladimir Vasiliev, chief researcher at the Institute of USA and Canada of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who closely studies this topic, Trump has declared war on CIA, which he blames for his electoral defeat in 2020. Vasiliev estimates that so far, the fight against the deep state in foreign and domestic intelligence is proceeding steadily, but will now 'accelerate' with the confirmation of former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for the post of head of national intelligence, and Kash Patel for the post of FBI director. On the other hand, the Delhi grapevine, which is dominated by fellow travellers of the defunct Biden regime is that Deep State will ultimately have the last laugh and Trump may not even be allowed to complete his 4-year term. But to my mind, that is wishful thinking. Trump’s grit should not be underestimated. Nor the seamless resources and tools at his command to queer the pitch of the disarray within the Democratic Party, which traditionally provided the requisite political cover for the Deep State. There is, conceivably, a method in Trump’s provocative moves, with some able help from Elon Musk and Steve Bannon, to stir up the pot in European politics, including Germany and Britain, who constitute the high ground of Euro-atlanticism in the continent, which serves to prevent a coalescing of liberal-globalist cliques within the transatlantic system. Patel has hinted that sufficient incriminating evidence of misuse of power is available to damn the Old Guard all the way up to Biden himself. Trump cannot be unaware of the high importance of pre-empting a Democratic backlash. The federal judges in Democrat-ruled states are openly challenging Trump’s methods. Suffice to say, Trump’s credibility to entrap the Old Guard in a cobweb of protracted litigation will be a game changer. The latest poll shows that Trump enjoys a soaring 77% support for cleaning up the swamp. The optic of this crusade is going to be hugely consequential to Trump’s ability to push both his domestic and foreign policy programme.

Trudeau: What Went Wrong, And What Lies Ahead For Canada? – OpEd	By Julia Taleb When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office in 2015, he ushered in a wave of optimism, diversity and inclusivity. His charisma and vision propelled the Liberal Party from third place to a majority government. Trudeau promised a progressive agenda centered on climate action, gender equality and reconciliation with indigenous peoples — a stark departure from the policies of his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. Nearly a decade later, Trudeau’s popularity has steadily declined. While he did fulfill some campaign promises, he fell short on others, and some backfired, leading to a gradual decline in public trust. Economic challenges, internal party divisions and a series of controversies gradually destabilized both Trudeau and the Liberal Party. His resignation announcement on January 6 marked the culmination of years of dissatisfaction. The economic toll A key factor in Trudeau’s decline was his government’s inability to address the economic anxieties of ordinary Canadians. Housing affordability became a crisis, with skyrocketing prices and limited inventory in urban centers. Despite government measures such as theFirst-Time Home Buyer Incentive, Trudeau failed to address structural housing issues. Canada’s inflation rate peaked at 6.8% in 2022 before gradually declining, while GDP growth languished at 1.3%. Economic uncertainty, driven by external trade tensions and domestic policy shortcomings, further fueled voter frustrations. Under Trudeau’s leadership, Canada experienced its worst economic growth in recent history, with annual per-person GDP growth averaging just 0.3%. Trudeau’s government overspent, leading to a deficit of $61.9 billion for the 2023–2024 fiscal year, far exceeding the target of $40.1 billion. This fiscal shortfall raised concerns about the government’s ability to meet its financial commitments. The final blow came in December 2024 when Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland resigned over disagreements about economic management and the government’s response to US President Donald Trump’s threats to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports. This move could raise prices for consumers and businesses, trigger retaliatory measures by Canada and lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth in both countries. Freeland’s resignation exposed deep divisions within the party and signaled a loss of confidence in Trudeau’s ability to lead effectively. In the weeks before his resignation, Trudeau faced mounting internal pressure as multiple Liberal members of parliament (MPs) publicly called for his departure, citing concerns about his leadership and the party’s future. For instance, Ontario MP Chad Collins stated that the Liberal caucus was 'not united' on Trudeau’s continued leadership, suggesting the party needed a new vision. These internal divisions, combined with declining public support, left Trudeau with little choice but to step down. In his resignation announcement, he cited 'internal battles' as a distraction, stating that Canada 'deserved a real choice in the next election.' Public perception and scandals Controversies marred Trudeau’s tenure and undermined public trust. In 2019, reports revealed that Trudeau’s office had pressured then-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a major Canadian engineering firm facing corruption charges for allegedly bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau’s office sought to secure a deferred prosecution agreement for the company, allowing it to avoid a criminal trial. The ethics commissioner concluded that Trudeau had violated federal conflict of interest rules by attempting to influence the legal proceedings. Another major case was Trudeau’s approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, designed to transport oil from Alberta to British Columbia. It sparked widespread criticism from environmentalists and Indigenous groups, who cited concerns over oil spills and its environmental impact. The approval contradicted Trudeau’s earlier commitments to both environmental sustainability and Indigenous reconciliation, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Trudeau initially saw a surge in popularity due to his steady communication and swift government support programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. However, his popularity waned as the pandemic dragged on, particularly during the Freedom Convoy protests in early 2022. These demonstrations, sparked by vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers, evolved into broader opposition to government restrictions, leading to blockades in downtown Ottawa and key trade routes like the Ambassador Bridge. Trudeau’s response, including invoking the Emergencies Act, was divisive — praised by some as necessary to restore order but criticized by others as government overreach. What lies ahead for Canada? Trudeau’s resignation marks the end of an era in Canadian politics that began with immense promise but ended with significant challenges and disillusionment. The Liberal Party must now grapple with internal divisions, voter fatigue and a growing appetite for change as they prepare for the next federal election. Two key candidates have emerged: former Finance Minister Chrystia Freelandand former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. They signal a potential shift toward a more fiscally conservative and economically pragmatic approach. Freeland brings political experience, a strong party base and a proven track record as deputy prime minister and finance minister. However, she must overcome Trudeau’s legacy and the public’s growing frustration with the party. On the other hand, Carney offers a fresh alternative with strong economic expertise and a reputation as a global leader on climate and fiscal policy that may appeal to centrists and dissatisfied Liberals. However, his lack of political experience and grassroots support are key obstacles. Currently, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, known for his populist approach, is leading in the polls. His rise suggests a potential shift towards more conservative policies, reflecting public dissatisfaction with the status quo rather than a definitive embrace of conservatism. Poilievre’s focus on reducing inflation and increasing housing affordability has also resonated with Canadians seeking practical solutions to everyday challenges. The Liberal Party’s choice of leader will determine whether they can regain public trust or risk further decline. The next election will not only define the country’s political trajectory but also test the resilience of the Liberal Party’s legacy. The convergence of political shifts, trade uncertainties and economic challenges suggests a complex path ahead of Canada. Whether Canadians embrace new leadership, reject the Liberal brand altogether or simply seek change, one thing is clear: The decisions made in the coming months will shape the nation’s future for years to come.

Turkmenistan: Second Conscientious Objector Sentenced To Correcti...	By Felix Corley A second Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector is serving a corrective labour sentence, where the state takes a fifth of his wages. On 27 January, a Dashoguz Region court sentenced 20-year-old Agabek Rozbayew to 18 months' corrective labour. The indictment shows he informed the Military Conscription Office in September 2022 that he could not perform compulsory military service on grounds of conscience. More than 10 others appear to be under criminal investigation. An assistant to regime-appointed Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa told Forum 18: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow is paralysed in prison hospital. On 27 January, Shabat District Court in the north-eastern Dashoguz Region sentenced 20-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Agabek Rozbayew to one year and six months' corrective labour. This means that while he does not have to go to prison, he must pay the State 20 per cent of his salary from his employment during that period. Rozbayew did not appeal and the verdict has entered into force, a court official told Forum 18. Rozbayew's verdict marks the second time since December 2024 that a court has convicted a Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector for refusing compulsory military service. On 18 December 2024, the regime imposed a punishment on a conscientious objector for the first known time since 2021, when 16 jailed conscientious objectors were freed under amnesty (see below). On 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed down the maximum two-year jail term to 21-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Arslan Wepayew. On 7 January 2025, Mary Regional Court changed his sentence on appeal to two years' corrective labour (see below). 'We are deeply concerned that this is the second criminal case against a conscientious objector in recent times,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. 'We are greatly saddened that, after a brief period of calm since May 2021, Turkmenistan has resumed prosecuting and imprisoning conscientious objectors, in violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it acceded on 1 May 1997. The government has consistently ignored the UN Human Rights Committee's Views censuring Turkmenistan for violating the ICCPR and obligating it to provide a genuine alternative civilian service not under military command' (see below). More than 10 other Jehovah's Witness conscientious objectors appear to be under criminal investigation, Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from the capital Ashgabat: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Asked why young men who cannot perform military service on grounds of conscience cannot perform an alternative civilian service, the assistant responded: 'I'm not a lawyer. I need to clarify this' (see below). Yusupguly Eshshayew, the regime-appointed Chair of the Mejlis (lower chamber of Parliament) Human Rights Committee, did not answer his phone each time Forum 18 called (see below). Since autumn 2022, Rozbayew has repeatedly received summonses to appear at the Military Conscription Office. 'Each time he was summoned, he respectfully explained his Bible-based beliefs and why he refused to perform military service,' Jehovah's Witnesses noted (see below). On 20 December 2024, the Prosecutor's Office summoned Rozbayew. Officials told him verbally that a criminal case had been initiated against him. On 6 January 2025, Shabat District Prosecutor's Office issued the indictment against him. The indictment – seen by Forum 18 - quotes Wepa Cholukow of Shabat District Military Conscription Office confirming that when Rozbayew was first called up in September 2022, the young man had told officials that his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness do not allow him to serve in the military (see below). Rozbayew's older brother Rasul was twice sentenced for refusing military service on grounds of conscience (see below). The 51-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow remains in poor health in strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is one of five readers of the works of the late Muslim theologian Said Nursi jailed for 12 years in 2017. Three of the group are also held in the same labour camp (see below). 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 in January. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' His family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored' (see below). When in January Forum 18 asked an official at Labour Camp MR-E/16 – who did not give his name – about Shamyradow's poor health, the official put the phone down (see below). Shamyradow remains paralysed in prison hospital. 'He lies in bed,' the individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 on 12 February (see below). Asked why individuals like Shamyradow and the other Muslims have been jailed on long sentences, the assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Gurbannazarowa told Forum 18: 'I need to clarify this.' He declined to answer any other questions (see below). The 42-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Bahram Saparow is also held in Labour Camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is being punished for leading a Muslim study group in the eastern city of Turkmenabat. The regime arrested and jailed more than 60 of the group's participants from 2013. At least three are known to have died in prison of torture or neglect. At least four others are known to have been freed after completing their sentences. No alternative to compulsory military service Turkmenistan offers no alternative to its compulsory military service. Military service for men between the ages of 18 and 27 is generally two years. Article 58 of the 2016 Constitution describes defence as a 'sacred duty' of everyone and states that military service is compulsory for men. Young men who refuse military service on grounds of conscience generally face prosecution under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. (Article 241 replaced the almost identically-worded Article 219 when the new Criminal Code came into force on 1 January 2023.) Turkmenistan has ignored repeated international calls, for example by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, to introduce a genuine civilian alternative to compulsory military service, to stop prosecuting and punishing conscientious objectors, and to compensate those it has punished. The UN Human Rights Committee has published 14 Decisions in favour of 16 conscientious objectors from Turkmenistan, all of them Jehovah's Witnesses. The most recent – in March 2022 – was in the case of Arslan Begenchow (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses filed a complaint with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in May 2020 on behalf of 19 then-current or former jailed conscientious objectors. Legally-binding international human rights obligations The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has noted that conscientious objection to military service comes under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 18 ('Freedom of thought, conscience and religion') and has recognised 'the right of everyone to have conscientious objection to military service as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.' The OHCHR has also noted in its Conscientious Objection to Military Service guide that Article 18 is 'a non-derogable right .. even during times of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.' In 2022 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated (WGAD-HRC50) that 'the right to conscientious objection to military service is part of the absolutely protected right to hold a belief under article 18 (1) of the Covenant [the ICCPR], which cannot be restricted by States.' The Working Group also stated: 'States should refrain from imprisoning individuals solely on the basis of their conscientious objection to military service, and should release those that have been so imprisoned.' It added: 'All States should adopt appropriate legislative or other measures to ensure that conscientious objector status is recognized.' Second conscientious objector corrective labour sentence Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Agabek Ruslanowich Rozbayew (born 1 October 2004) is from a village in Shabat District of the north-eastern Dashoguz Region. He refused military service when first called up in autumn 2022 and on subsequent occasions, most recently on 9 December 2024. He explained to Shabat District Military Conscription Office why on grounds of conscience he could not take up arms and swear the military oath. Jehovah's Witnesses are conscientious objectors to military service and do not undertake any kind of activity supporting any country's military. But they are willing to undertake an alternative, totally civilian form of service, as is the right of all conscientious objectors to military service under international human rights law. On 19 December 2024, the Military Conscription Office sent Rozbayew's case to Shabat District Prosecutor's Office, which launched a preliminary investigation and questioned witnesses. On 6 January, prosecutors issued the indictment against Rozbayew. Deputy Prosecutor R. Rozymuradow prepared the indictment, which was counter-signed by District Prosecutor Shyly Pellayew. They brought charges against Rozbayew under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'), according to the indictment seen by Forum 18. This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. 'The Holy Scriptures that Jehovah's Witnesses read state that one must not take up arms and participate in war, nor take a military oath,' the indictment quotes Rozbayew as telling investigators. The indictment quotes Wepa Cholukow of Shabat District Military Conscription Office confirming that on 9 September 2022, when Rozbayew was first called up, the young man had told officials that his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness do not allow him to serve in the military. Rozbayew tried to challenge the opening of the criminal case in court. Forum 18 was unable to reach Shabat District Military Conscription Office or the Prosecutor's Office. Rozbayew's older brother Rasul was convicted twice for refusing military service on grounds of conscience. Niyazov District Court sentenced him for a second time to two years' imprisonment on 16 March 2021. He was freed under the general amnesty on 8 May 2021. On 27 January, Shabat District Court convicted Rozbayew. The Judge sentenced him to one year and six months' corrective labour. 'He has been given the written decision,' a court official – who did not give his name - told Forum 18 on 12 February. This means that while he does not have to go to prison, he must pay the State 20 per cent of his salary from his employment during that period. Rozbayew did not appeal and the verdict has entered into force, the court official added. Under the Criminal Implementation Code, those serving a corrective labour sentence live at home but are assigned to a place of work. They must report any change of address or place of work within 10 days, and must report to the authorities twice a month. The place of work is responsible for making the deductions from earnings and handing the money to the state. Jehovah's Witnesses 'deeply concerned' over second criminal case 'We are deeply concerned that this is the second criminal case against a conscientious objector in recent times,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. 'We are greatly saddened that, after a brief period of calm since May 2021, Turkmenistan has resumed prosecuting and imprisoning conscientious objectors, in violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it acceded on 1 May 1997. The government has consistently ignored the UN Human Rights Committee's Views censuring Turkmenistan for violating the ICCPR and obligating it to provide a genuine alternative civilian service not under military command' An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from the capital Ashgabat on 13 February that she was out of the office. Asked why two conscientious objectors have been sentenced to corrective labour, the assistant responded: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Asked why young men who cannot perform military service on grounds of conscience cannot perform an alternative civilian service, the assistant responded: 'I'm not a lawyer. I need to clarify this.' Gurbannazarowa's annual report for 2023 – her most recent available – makes no mention of any attempts to introduce an alternative civilian service for those who cannot serve in the military on grounds of conscience. Yusupguly Eshshayew, the regime-appointed Chair of the Mejlis (lower chamber of Parliament) Human Rights Committee, did not answer his phone each time Forum 18 called on 13 February. Court jails conscientious objector for two years Arslan Wepayew (born 7 February 2003) is a Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector from Bayramaly, Mary Region, east of the capital Ashgabat. In October 2024, the Military Conscription Office ordered Wepayew to report for military service on 19 December 2024. On 17 October, he submitted a written statement of conscientious objection to military service 'based on sincere religious beliefs', Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. He made clear to the Military Conscription Office that he was prepared to undertake alternative civilian service. On 19 October, prosecutors opened a criminal case against Wepayew under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). Formal charges were laid on 31 October 2024, but prosecutors did not inform Wepayew. Officials took him into custody on 13 November. On 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed Wepayew the maximum two-year jail term under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). Wepayew appealed against his conviction. Sentence changed to corrective labour On 7 January 2025, a panel of three judges at Mary Regional Court heard Arslan Wepayew's appeal. The court changed his sentence to two years' corrective labour, with 20 per cent of his earnings to be taken by the regime. This is the maximum corrective labour punishment under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service') Wepayew was then released from the detention centre, where he had been held since November 2024. Forum 18 is unaware of any previous cases where a conscientious objector's jail sentence was changed on appeal to corrective labour, However, from 2014 courts punished conscientious objectors with corrective labour or suspended prison terms, rather than imprisonment. However, jailings resumed in January 2018. In May 2021, the regime freed all the 16 then-jailed known conscientious objectors. This was the first known criminal conviction of a conscientious objector in Turkmenistan since May 2021, when the last 16 imprisoned conscientious objectors – all of them Jehovah's Witness young men - were released under a general amnesty. UN Committee notes regime's failure to implement 2022 decision On 4 November 2024, the United Nations Human Rights Committee reviewed implementation of its March 2022 decision in the case of another former jailed Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector, Arslan Begenchow. The Committee had found that the regime had violated his human rights (CCPR/C/134/D/3272/2018). In February 2023, Begenchow's lawyer had noted that neither he nor Begenchow 'were aware of any steps taken by the State party to implement the Committee's Views'. The UN Committee's November 2024 progress report on individual communications (CCPR/C/142/2) reviewed how the regime had responded to the Committee's three key recommendations:- Expunging Begenchow's criminal record;- Providing Begenchow with adequate compensation, including by reimbursing any legal costs he has incurred;- Non-repetition, including by reviewing the legislation of the State party with a view to ensuring the effective guarantee of the right to conscientious objection under Article 18 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 'for instance by providing for the possibility of alternative service of a civilian nature'. In all three provisions, the UN Committee found: 'Information or measures taken are contrary to or reflect rejection of the recommendation.' The Committee noted: 'One Expert noted there was no convincing evidence that the State party had contemplated compensation of any kind to [Begenchow].' The Committee decided: 'Close the follow-up dialogue, with a note of unsatisfactory implementation of the Committee's recommendation.' Paralysed religious prisoner of conscience 'lies in bed' in prison hospital Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow (born 7 May 1973) is one of five Sunni Muslims punished for meeting with others to pray and study their faith using the works of the late Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi. The authorities arrested the group in May and June 2017. On 15 August 2017, Balkan Regional Court in the regional capital Balkanabat in western Turkmenistan sentenced the five men to 12-year jail terms each in strict regime labour camps. The court ordered that religious literature, mobile phones and cash be seized from them. The Supreme Court in Ashgabat refused on 11 July 2018 to overturn the 12-year strict-regime jail terms imposed on the five prisoners of conscience. Four of the five - Shamyradow, Meret Hydyrowich Owezow, Ahmet Bayramberdiyewich Mammetdurdyyew and Begejik Begejikow – initially served their sentences in the isolated top-security prison at Ovadan-Depe (Picturesque Hill) in the Karakum desert 70 kms (45 miles) north of Ashgabat. They were transferred in mid-2022 to the strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 on the north-eastern edge of Bayramaly in Mary Region, where they remain. The fifth member of the group, Jumanazar Yuldashowich Hojambetow, is being held in the labour camp BL-E/6 in Balkan Region. The camp houses former police officers and other former officials. 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 in January. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' In view of his poor health, Shamyradow's family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored,' the individual told Forum 18. The duty officer at Labour Camp MR-E/16 put Forum 18 through on 8 January to a colleague. When Forum 18 asked about Shamyradow's poor health, the official – who did not give his name – put the phone down. Shamyradow remains paralysed in prison hospital. 'He lies in bed,' the individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 on 12 February. An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from Ashgabat on 13 February that she was out of the office. Asked why individuals like Shamyradow and the other Muslims have been jailed on long sentences, the assistant responded: 'I need to clarify this.' He declined to answer any other questions.

In Syria, The Barbarians Aren’t At The Gate, They’re In Power Wit...	Atrocities are being committed every day in Syria by the new rulers, according to Irish writer and peace activist Declan Hayes. However, the Western corporate-run media are ignoring or censoring the horrific reality because the Western governments backed the regime-change operation. He says that Syria – a cradle of civilization – is now being ruled by barbarians with the tacit support of Western governments and media. The population is living under a reign of terror because the new rulers are terrorists affiliated with Islamic State who espouse an extremist version of Islam that does not tolerate other religions or versions of Islam. Declan Hayes visited Syria as a peace activist and humanitarian many times during the decade-long war in that country. He witnessed the aftermath of atrocities carried out by insurgent groups in Latakia, Kassab, and Maaloula, among other places. These mercenary groups were proxy forces financed and armed by the United States and its Western allies in a covert war for regime change against the former Syrian government. The reasons for the regime-change operation were geopolitical due to the West’s support for Israel and antagonism towards Russia and Iran, as well as control of oil and gas resources. Hayes maintains close contact with religious leaders and other community figures in Syria, especially among the Alawite, Christian and Shia Muslim communities. He says that the appalling violence and killings that were carried out by the Western-backed terror proxies during the decade-long war are continuing to be inflicted today. Homes and villages are raided daily by armed supporters of Syria’s new ruling regime led by the de facto president, Ahmed al Sharaa, also known as Mohammad al Jolani, who is the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia. HTS was formerly an affiliate of Islamic State and other Al Qaeda-linked terror networks. HTS seized power two months ago in Damascus after former President Bashar al-Assad fled the country with his family. Assad is living in exile in Russia. The collapse of his government surprised the world but in many ways, it shouldn’t have been a surprise because Syria was worn down and destroyed by a 10-year war sponsored by the U.S., European powers, Israel and the Gulf Arab kingdoms. The country was also devastated by crippling Western economic sanctions. Assad’s allies, Russia and Iran, could not prevent the collapse and takeover by the Western terrorist proxies. Syria is facing an extremely dangerous future where the new regime is exacting brutal retribution against minorities and communities perceived as being loyal to Assad. What makes the situation all the more grim is that the United States and European Union governments and their media are propping up the new regime, whitewashing its violations and its terrorist links, or simply ignoring the daily atrocities being inflicted. However, Declan Hayes contends that the new rulers of Syria do not have a firm control over the country where resistance to the reign of terror is growing.

Was The AI Summit In Paris A Missed Opportunity? – OpEd	By Simone Galimberti Since the start of the Paris AI Action Summit, held on the 10th and 11th of February, the expectations were minimal. Yet there was a trickle of hope that the gathering would succeed at maintaining a modicum focus on safety and security of artificial intelligence. Instead, the speeches resembled more business pitches. There was a deliberate intent at attracting billions of investments to spur the unlimited potential of a new technology that has already become so pervasive to our lives. Those at the Summit, concerned with the implications of an unregulated and unchecked AI could not find neither a glimpse of a symbolic traffic light nor of a guardrail, two images often invoked to slow down the crazy pace of AI development. Instead, in the words of Kevin Rose of the New York Times, it was like 'watching policymakers on horseback trying to install seatbelts on a passing Lamborghini'. Many wondered if there was a real intention, on the part of the policymakers in questions, to seriously set any standards at all. Watching their speeches, each of them, from JD Vance, the new American Vice President, to the European Commission’s President, Ursula Von der Leyen, to President Macron of France to PM Modi of India, it seems like they were trying to outmatch each other. It was like every single of them was trying to outperform the competitors, all generously offering free passes to the 'racing circuit' of AI development. Only UN Secretary-General António Guterres tried with his speech, to take the moral high ground. He remembered the audience of the high risks of a race to the bottom in developing and deploying AI tools that humanity, sooner than later, might lose control of. Wide gap Yet, at the same time, I can’t possibly imagine of a wider gap between the key messages emerged from the leaders and the discussions on the sidelines of the big speeches. Lots of cross cutting discussions related to the transformational shifts posed by artificial intelligence indeed took place. Listening to the pro business talks by the political leaders, it comes easy to dismiss the fact that the whole initiative was grounded over five underlying central pillars of absolute importance. Indeed, talking and tackling issues like Public Interest AI, The Future of Work, Innovation and Culture, Trust in AI and Global AI Governance, the key themes at Paris, remains central to ensure that the AI can be truly a force for good, rather than a force for self-destruction. But, as anticipated, these complex discussions were inevitably overshadowed by the political impetus of harnessing the business potential of the AI revolution. The United Nations, despite immense efforts over the last few years, to lead a global conversation on ethical AI development, appeared powerless, unable to steer the conversation. This happened despite the engagement in Paris not only of the Secretary General but also of active presence of Mr. Amandeep Singh Gill, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology. It is not that the two final outcomes of the Summit, the Paris Charter on Artificial Intelligence in the Public Interest and Statement on Inclusive and Sustainable Artificial Intelligence for People and the Planet, did not contain some references to the ethical imperatives that comes with AI. But even a sympathetic reading of them cannot flip the narrative of an agenda brazenly centered on deregulating the rollout of AI. Then how counter such intentional purpose of doing whatever it takes to incentivize the rushing to develop Artificial General Intelligence, a technology that, at minimum, will equal human capacities and, over the time, surpass them? The only hope is that the United Nations won’t give up on its moral mission to promote AI safeguards, achieving a global consensus on deploying the 'traffic lights', 'seatbelts' or any other precautionary tools indispensable for an ethical development of AI. The problem is that global leaders do not care about them. Only PM Modi, in his speech, spoke of the SDGs and 'to ensure that the AI future is for Good, and for All'. But then even Mr. Modi was taken over by an overoptimistic view that AI won’t jeopardize millions and millions of jobs but rather will be a multiplier of them. So, at the end of the day, it will be up to Mr. Guterres and Mr. Singh Gill to find a way to, once again, bring into the global agenda, the need of AI as a real force of good. Nice words delivered in international summits like the upcoming 3rd UNESCO Global Forum on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to take place from 24 to 27 June 2025 in Bangkok, won’t be nearly enough. Nor the upgrading of Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology into a new UN Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies (ODET) always under Mr. Singh Gill, as positive development as it is, will be sufficient. The UN needs a new bold strategy that should include an effective public relation dimension that, even if cannot match the prowess of Silicon Valley, can at least challenge the mainstream narrative so dominating in Paris. Involving and engaging big personalities like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei who did not hesitate calling the Summit 'a missed opportunity', should be a top priority. The propositions set in Governing AI for Humanity, the groundbreaking report prepared by the UN AI Advisory Board, must be fully taken into consideration and they should become policies. In Paris, unfortunately, it did not happen. If you look at them, none of them are even radical nor bold enough. The UN’s efforts for truly setting up common rules and standards and a global governance architecture for the AI must be re-thought, starting from a complete re-branding. Indeed, if we need business-like pitches, these should come from the UN. The stakes are too high for the UN to give up on its core mandate, saving humanity from the very probable and realistic possibility of AI induced mayhem. Simone Galimberti writes about the SDGs, youth-centered policy-making and a stronger and better United Nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRanu0p5u7YVZ	2025-02-16T16:45:17-08:00	
German Elections Important For Middle East – OpEd	By Dr. Diana Galeeva Germany will hold federal elections on Feb. 23. Last week, during a discussion at Oxford University, a well-informed speaker who advises European governments responded to my question about how the results of the 2024 European Parliament elections may affect relations with the Middle East. He commented that the topic was not high on the agenda of the region’s countries. Arguably, the forthcoming German elections also do not seem to be on the agenda of Middle Eastern countries’ governments.However, this assumption ignores how Middle Eastern governments have been revising their international relations and I suggest that this should be regarded as a golden opportunity to plan and execute strategic policies toward the EU (and especially its traditional heavyweights). The bloc is struggling, especially with economic and immigration pressures, meaning new perspectives are more likely to receive a hearing.Now is the time for offering 'win-win' scenarios, when the Middle East’s energy-rich countries, with their accumulated experience of dealing with the most challenging matters in Germany (such as radicalism and terrorism), can boost relations between Europe and the region.Who are the main candidates in these elections in Germany and whose policies could Middle Eastern governments deal with profitably? What are their agendas and, based on these, what are the potential areas for collaboration?Briefly, there are five candidates who aim to become German chancellor. At this stage, Friedrich Merz’s conservative Christian Democratic Union leads the polls. Merz’s slogan is 'A Germany we can be proud of again.' He suggests restricting immigration and cutting taxes. He has also promised to boost Germany’s aid to Ukraine.Olaf Scholz, who has been chancellor for the past three years, heads the Social Democratic Party, but his government has struggled, largely because of the impact of the Ukraine war.Alice Weidel, of the far-right Alternative for Germany, backs the deportation of migrants and has suggested ending the sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine war. Meanwhile, the Greens’ Robert Habeck, who was vice chancellor and economy minister in the Scholz government, instead propounds strong support for Ukraine.Sahra Wagenknecht of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance suggests closer relations with Russia and offers strong support to her base in eastern Germany. Her policies include strict limits on asylum and immigration.In short, the candidates’ manifestos focus on the economic crisis and political orientation toward Russia, as well as possible reforms in immigration and asylum — all topics that are very much related with the Middle East.The German economy is Europe’s biggest, but these days it seems in need of revival. External actors, including Middle Eastern countries, have an unusual opening to provide solutions. The region’s energy-rich countries might be useful in overcoming several of the challenges that Germany is facing, such as its energy crisis, in addition to becoming key investors who could bolster the German economy in such challenging times. These mutually beneficial shifts could also be used for building diplomatic dialogue. Previously, Germany largely built its economic relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries based on non-energy exports, in the infrastructure, manufacture and service sectors. However, because of the Ukraine war and the energy crisis — which seems set to continue, perhaps not least because several of Germany’s chancellor candidates want to boost aid to Ukraine — Qatar and Germany in 2022 signed a declaration to boost their energy collaborations through trade in hydrogen and liquefied natural gas. And at the beginning of this month, Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power and Germany’s SEFE energy company signed a deal to deliver green hydrogen to Europe. Under the deal, Saudi Arabia aims to export 200,000 tonnes of green hydrogen to the continent by 2030.Another possible area for collaboration relates to the series of deadly terrorist attacks, including those in Mannheim, Aschaffenburg, Solingen and Magdeburg, which have put pressure on the mainstream parties to reform Germany’s asylum and immigration rules. There will be pressure on the incoming government to introduce new and effective ways to control immigration.Counterintuitively, at a time of increased social tension, as most of the suspects in these attacks are from Middle Eastern countries, I suggest that there are opportunities for the region’s moderate nations to build constructive relations based on their expertise on antiterrorism and antiradical reforms. Contrary to some populist narratives, violence is not integral to these suspects’ ethnic background, but a radicalization of it. Centrist candidates, in particular, might welcome dialogue that makes the discussion less binary and more political and human instead.The countries of the Middle East have strong experience in this regard, which might be helpful for Germany and the rest of Europe. For example, at the UN General Assembly in 2017, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the current UAE deputy prime minister and foreign minister, stressed his country’s resolve to fight terrorism, suggesting working together to eradicate the threat and its radical ideological roots. This becomes especially urgent with the implications of the Gaza and Lebanon wars.Finally, regional transformations offer further opportunities for closer collaboration. As a result of the Angela Merkel government’s decision in 2015-2016 not to close Germany’s borders to refugees fleeing Syria’s civil war, there are about 1 million people with a Syrian passport in Germany. Jens Spahn, deputy leader of the CDU, has suggested chartering planes and giving Syrians €1,000 ($1,049) to return to their home country following the collapse of the Assad government. Weidel has suggested that 'whoever in Germany celebrates ‘free Syria’ obviously has no reason any more to have fled.'Both the German and French foreign ministers have met Syria’s new leaders. Germany’s Annalena Baerbock spoke (guardedly) of Europe’s support for Syria’s transitional government in Damascus, stating: 'A political new beginning between Europe and Syria, between Germany and Syria, is possible.'It seems that, using the example of collaboration with a new Syrian government to deal with immigration and asylum, it could also be useful to form strategies and future policies with Syria and beyond. In other words, while acknowledging the failures and mistakes of previous German governments, it might be useful for the next government, in collaboration with Middle Eastern actors and stakeholders, to form effective policies toward immigration and refugee problems. This might set a good example for other EU countries that face similar problems.To sum up, the most challenging topics for German society today include issues that are closely connected to the existing resources and accumulated knowledge of the Middle East. These could be harnessed through 'win-win' policies. This is why the elections are important to the region and could prove to be a golden opportunity to cement relations with a troubled European heavyweight.

Europe Scrambles After Exclusion From Ukraine Talks – Analysis	By Frud Bezhan (RFE/RL) -- European leaders will meet on February 17 for an emergency summit to discuss Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine. The hastily arranged meeting in Paris is in response to mounting fears that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia will negotiate an end to the war alone, leaving Ukraine and its European allies on the sidelines. European leaders are expected to present a united front and discuss new proposals to support Ukraine and bolster European security. 'There seems to be a group of EU countries who are clear that they are not going to be part of a poorly designed and hasty Trump deal, and who are focused on continuing their support to Ukraine,' said Majda Ruge, senior policy fellow at the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations. Concerns in Europe have intensified after Keith Kellogg, Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said on February 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in peace talks. On the same day, it emerged that U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to start talks on ending the war -- possibly without Ukraine itself. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 16 arrived in the neighboring United Arab Emirates seeking to boost economic ties after attending the Munich Security Conference. He said he would later travel to Saudi Arabia, but Ukrainian officials said he had no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials there. Just days earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Washington was no longer 'primarily focused' on Europe’s security, in another blow to the continent. The moves by Washington have triggered alarm and left European leaders on the continent scrambling over how to respond to what they see as Washington’s unilateral approach to ending the Ukraine war. But it is unclear if the continent can overcome its deep divisions and come up with its own concrete strategy to end the Ukraine war and deal with Russia. 'Europe has spent more time discussing, making statements, and making calls than actually putting its money where its mouth is and stepping up to give concrete support to Ukraine or to pursue any other policy of its own choosing,' said Ian Garner, a Russian expert at the Warsaw-based Pilecki Institute. European officials have warned that a hurriedly agreed peace or cease-fire deal will undermine Ukraine and wider European security. Europe is the largest financial supporter of Ukraine, even overtaking the United States. But it lags in military support, despite pledges to boost defense spending and arms production in recent years. With the exceptions of Hungary and Slovakia, there is broad support for Ukraine in Europe. But there is also disagreement 'Everybody is technically on the same page,' said Garner. 'The problem is when you actually look at finer details of the plans, everybody disagrees.' The creation of a European army is a prime example. Some European leaders have called for deploying European military forces to Ukraine to ensure security if a peace deal is agreed. But the idea has been rebuffed by other officials, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. 'All these European leaders are still trapped in potential maybes,' added Garner. 'Nobody has come up with a cohesive, comprehensive, and collaborative plan to say, ‘here’s what we would actually be willing to definitely do.’ And so, of course, Trump, Putin, and even Zelenskyy don’t take Europe seriously.'

Sudan, ‘The Most Devastating Humanitarian And Displacement Crisis...	Sudan’s ruinous civil war is approaching its third year, leaving a legacy of malnutrition, massive population displacement and chronic insecurity. As the UN system prepares to launch a call for record funding of $4.2 billion to support aid operations in the country, here are some of the main things to know about what has been described as the largest and most devasting displacement, humanitarian and protection crisis in the world today. 1) The war: 2023 Khartoum clashes herald end of peace process By the end of 2022, there were hopes that a UN- backed peace process would finally lead to a civilian administration in Sudan, after a tumultuous period which saw the fall of long-term dictator Omar al-Bashir in a military coup, followed by the harsh suppression of protests in favour of civilian rule. 'A final political agreement should pave the way towards building a democratic State', said former UN Special Representative for Sudan, Volker Perthes, in December 2022. Ominously, however, he warned that 'critical contentious issues' remained, not least a merger of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), separate military groups which had teamed up to depose al-Bashir. Tensions between the two sides grew in early 2023, marked by intermittent clashes, but the start of the current civil war came with the RSF attack on the capital Khartoum on 15 April. The fighting, which then spread to other parts of the country, forced the UN to evacuate Khartoum, and base operations in the relatively stable city of Port Sudan, on the Red Sea. On Friday, the Secretary-General, described the situation in Sudan as a catastrophe of 'staggering scale and brutality' at the AU's high stakes annual meeting in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and warned that it is increasingly spilling into the wider region. The UN has strongly condemned the fighting, and the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy to Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, continues to support peace efforts, in close collaboration with regional organizations, including the African Union (AU). 2) Humanitarian crisis: More than 30 million need aid The war has been catastrophic for Sudan’s civilians and the numbers are staggering. Some 30.4 million people – over two thirds of the total population – are in need of assistance, from health to food and other forms of humanitarian support. The fighting has led to an economic collapse, sending the prices of food, fuel and other basic goods soaring, putting them beyond the reach of many households. Acute hunger is a growing problem. Over half the population faces high levels of acute food insecurity, and famine conditions have been confirmed in five locations in North Darfur and the eastern Nuba mountains. Famine is expected to spread to five more areas by May of this year. 'This is a critical moment, as the consequences of food insecurity are already being felt in parts of South Kordofan, where families are surviving on dangerously limited food supplies, and malnutrition rates are rising sharply,' warned Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan. Humanitarian efforts are severely hampered by the lack of security, which is putting severe constraints on humanitarian access, complicating the movement of supplies and endangering aid workers. Despite the dangers, the UN and its humanitarian partners continue to reach vulnerable populations. The World Food Programme – the UN’s emergency food aid agency – is saving thousands of lives every day and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) successfully distributed seeds to over half a million households during the planting season. In all, some 15.6 million people received at least one form of aid from the UN in 2024. The country’s health system is on its knees, with health facilities attacked and many health workers forced to flee. The World Health Organization and UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are still operational, supporting immunization for cholera and malaria, and deploying mobile medical teams. 3) Massive displacement: Equivalent to the entire Swiss population Huge numbers of people have been forced to flee their homes for areas of relative safety, both within Sudan and in neighbouring countries, adding to regional instability. Over three million people are classified as refugees, and almost nine million are internally displaced. The total displaced population is greater than the entire population of Switzerland. Because of the shifting frontlines, there have been successive waves of displacement, making the task of reaching those in need increasingly complicated. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has described the situation in Sudan as 'the largest as well as the fastest growing displacement crisis globally.' The displaced population, whether they remain in Sudan or have moved abroad, face reduced access to food, scarce natural resources and limited access to essential services. In addition, outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and measles are rampant in camps for refugees and internally displaced people. Many of the surrounding nations have their own economic and security problems, and some are among the poorest in the world, with limited and overstretched services. Where possible, the UN migration agency (IOM) and UNHCR are protecting lives, supporting states hosting refugees, and ensuring that the needs of those fleeing are met with dignity. 4) Insecurity: Women and girls highly vulnerable Over 18,800 civilians have been reported killed since the beginning of the conflict, and the levels of violence in Sudan are getting worse. At the beginning of February, at least 275 people were killed in just one week, a threefold increase on the previous week’s death toll. Civilians are being hit by artillery shelling, airstrikes and aerial drone attacks: the worst affected regions are South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. As well as the general population, aid workers have been targets of intimidation and violence, with reports that some have been falsely accused of collaborating with the RSF. A UN fact-finding mission has documented a range of harrowing human rights violations committed by both the SAF and RSF, and called for investigations into the violations, and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. In an interview with UN News, Edmore Tondhlana, the deputy head of the UN humanitarian office (OCHA), explained that women and girls are the most severely impacted by the conflict, with reports of rape, forced marriage and abductions. 'If you look at the recent attack in South Kordofan, in which about 79 people were killed, the majority of victims were women and girls.' However, teenage boys are also at high risk. 'They cannot easily travel between frontlines. They will be suspected of spying,' added Mr. Tondhlana. Large numbers of children have been recruited into armed groups, forced to fight or spy against the other side. 5) Funding: Billions needed A lack of sufficient funds is severely limiting the UN’s ability to help Sudan’s population. UNHCR and partners have been able to provide less than the bare minimum of support for refugees, and food rations have been drastically cut, adding to food insecurity. On Monday, OCHA and UNHCR will launch an appeal for funding, based on their respective response plans to the crisis. Humanitarian needs have been estimated at a record (for Sudan) $4.2 billion, with an additional $1.8 billion needed to support those hosting refugees in neighbouring countries. Whilst the amount needed might seem large, Mr. Tondhlana emphasizes that, given the numbers in dire need, it barely scratches the surface. 'We’re trying to reach 21 million people, so this essentially $200 per person over the whole year. If we break it down even further, this is around $.0.50 per day.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRcr0OsSzQsSr	2025-02-16T16:34:36-08:00	
Kirill’s Crack About Critic Possibly Being From Western Ukraine S...	Until very recently, it was a commonplace among Western commentators on Ukraine that Western Ukraine, the portion that Stalin annexed to the USSR, was fundamentally different from the rest of that republic and even was the primary source of anti-Russian attitudes in Ukraine as a whole. But sociological investigations by Ukrainian scholars have shown that there has been almost a complete convergence in attitudes about Russia between Western Ukraine and the rest of that country (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/01/putins-invasion-has-led-to-almost.html). Consequently, talk in the West about divisions between Western Ukraine and Eastern Ukraine as far as attitudes toward Russia are concerned has become less common. But strikingly, it remains a prominent feature of discussions in Moscow about Ukraine and even appears to shape Kremlin views about how Ukraine might be partitioned to Moscow’s advantage. The latest example come from Moscow Patriarch Kirill who snapped back at a priest from Mozhaisk who said the church should be trying to help Russians find the way to Christ rather than to become better patriots of the Russian state and active supporters of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine (meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/12/are-you-from-western-ukraine). Kirill said that he’d 'never heard that before' and then pointedly asked whether the priest was 'by any chance from Western Ukraine?' The Meduza news agency reported that the hall 'filled with the sound of laughter and applause,' especially after the patriarch told the priest to 'go sit down and seriously reflect on what you just blurted out.' But Kirill’s remark is no laughing matter. Instead, it reflects both his unstinting support of almost anything Putin does and the belief both in the Kremlin and in the Patriarchate that Ukrainian opposition to Moscow is rooted in Western Ukraine rather than being part of the mentality of Ukrainians in the country as a whole. That has not only sparked suggestions in Moscow that Stalin made a major mistake by annexing Western Ukraine but also forms the core of Putin’s ideas about partitioning Ukraine where he assumes that without Western Ukraine, an eastern Ukraine annexed to Russia won’t be a problem (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/02/stepashin-says-stalin-made-major.html). That notion is almost as certainly wrong as it is widespread in Moscow, and that in turn means that even if the West stops supporting Ukraine and Moscow is allowed to annex large swaths of Ukraine to Russia, that will not end the conflict. Ukrainians in the east just like Ukrainians in the West will continue to resist whatever Moscow elites think.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRUR1Of0-r8cc	2025-02-16T16:31:00-08:00	
Bangladesh: Islamists Attack Book Fair For Promoting Women’s Mens...	Since Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge of an interim government in Bangladesh after the ouster of the Awami League regime , the country has witnessed a surge of radical Islamist activity. More than 250 Hindu and Buddhist temples, Christian churches and shrines of the Liberal Sufi Muslim saints have been vandalised and all institutions promoting liberal secular Bengali culture have been targeted. Even an annual fair organised in the memory of the legendary saint Lalon Fakir was closed down. Now the annual book fair in Dhaka, organised to observe the 1952 Bengali language movement in what was then undivided Pakistan, has been targeted. And the Yunus government, instead of clamping down on the Islamists have sought to appease them. The Annual Book Fair is one of Bangladesh's most cherished cultural events, where book lovers gather to celebrate Bengali heritage, intellectual freedom, and the power of ideas. However, under the rule of the Muhammad Yunus-led unelected government, the very essence of this festival is under attack as extremist forces tighten their grip on the nation. After months of violence against religious minorities, radical groups have now turned their attention to the book fair itself. In a shocking display of extremist Islamist fascism, Islamist militants targeted a stall selling sanitary napkins, branding it 'immoral' and demanding its removal. Instead of ensuring protection for the stall operators and upholding the rights of women and progressive entrepreneurs, Bangla Academy's Director General, Professor Mohammad Azam, chose to appease the extremists, recommending that the stall belonging to the Pran-RFL group, be shut down. Traditionally, the book fair has welcomed companies that support social progress, feminism, and health awareness. But under this regime, even essential healthcare products for women are being vilified in a disturbing push to erase progress in gender rights and public health awareness. The decision to dismantle the stall not only emboldens the radical forces but also signals the government's complicity in dismantling Bangladesh's hard-earned social advancements. The alignment of the Yunus administration with the extremist agenda is no longer subtle—it is open and unapologetic. By siding with religious radicals instead of safeguarding free expression and women's dignity, this government has shown that it is not only failing to protect its citizens but is actively enabling the spread of fundamentalism. As Bangladesh slips further into the hands of militant Islamists, the question remains: How much more of Bangladesh's heritage, rights, and freedoms will be sacrificed before the nation rises against this oppression? In fact, many fear that thos year , the celebration of 21st February ( locally Ekushe February) may be a muted affair. Bengalis remember the martyrs of the language movement who fell to police bullets on this day in 1952 . The Bengali language movement is seen as the starting point for the independence of Bangladesh from Islamist Pakistan. But under the Yunus regime, relations have sharply improved with Pakistan and there seems to be a conscious effort to play down the legacy of the Bengali language movement and the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. More than 700 Islamist radicals have either been released from jails or forcibly freed much before their sentence ended, even as the administration has been a silent spectator. Islamic State flags have been noticed in rallies or during mob attacks on libraries and museum which showcase the legacy of the Liberation War. Earlier this month, the museum in the ancestral house of Bangladesh's founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was bulldozed and destroyed. Many feel the Islamist groups who provide the muscle for Yunus' interim government are creating an environment to transform Bangladesh into an Taliban type Islamist Republic.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRWCGwBvgWqf8	2025-02-16T16:25:25-08:00	
Rubio: Hamas ‘Must Be Eradicated’	The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet to be negotiated. Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S. diplomat, told Netanyahu that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own and redevelop. While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a 'common strategy' for Gaza's future. Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over 17,000 militants. Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of Gaza. Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario. Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Hamas described the attack as a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRY41McruRy_8	2025-02-16T16:22:07-08:00	
Breaking Barriers: Can ASEAN Unlock Peace On The Korean Peninsula...	The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most volatile regions in the world with ongoing tensions between South and North Korea threatening regional and global security. Despite efforts for reconciliation summits including peace talks deep-rooted mistrust and political differences persist. In this context, ASEAN (Association of Asian Southeast Nations) holds significant potential to contribute and peace stability in the Korean Peninsula by leveraging its experience in multilateral diplomacy, economic cooperation, and confidence-building measures. ASEAN through its mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and ASEAN Plus Three (APT) can facilitate and promote dialogue, and economic collaboration and support de-escalation efforts. By engaging both Koreas within a regional framework that prioritizes dialogue and cooperation ASEAN can help reduce tensions and foster a path lasting toward peace. However, ASEAN faces challenges such as divisions political security concerns and the limitations imposed by international sanctions. Despite these ASEAN's challenges’neutral s and inclusive offers approach a valuable pathway toward progress on the Korean Peninsula. Economic cooperation initiatives serve as a crucial tool for building trust and interdependence between the two Koreas. According to 2024 a report by the ASEAN Secretariat regional intra-trade between ASEAN and South Korea reached $200 billion reflecting deep economic ties. However, trade with North Korea remains minimal due to sanctions. Despite ASEAN's potential to play a pivotal role, it can promote multilateral projects such as the development of tourism infrastructure and initiatives in areas like the Kaesong Industrial Complex, especially if sanctions are eased. Additionally, ASEAN + 3 which includes China Japan and South Korea could facilitate trilateral economic dialogues that incorporate North Korea into regional supply chains. Economic engagement has historically proven to reduce hostilities created by shared interests and ASEAN’s success in fostering regional economic integration makes it a credible facilitator. Confidence-building measures (CBMs) are another area where ASEAN can contribute meaningfully. The ASEAN Forum Regional (ARF) established in 1994 is the only multilateral security forum that includes both North and South Korea. In 2024, the ARF held its 31st session, focusing on preventive diplomacy and regional peacebuilding. Track II diplomacy, which involves civil society dialogues, complements Track I (official) efforts by enhancing understanding and reducing misconceptions. ASEAN's experience in resolving disputes, such as those in the South China Sea, can be applied to the Korean Peninsula. People-to-people exchange programs, along with cultural and sports diplomacy, can further foster goodwill. For instance, ASEAN's Youth Exchange Program in 2024 featured participants from both North and South Korea, fostering mutual understanding among younger generations. De-escalation of the Korean Peninsula requires addressing military and tensions security concerns. Can ASEAN promote transparency and risk reduction through joint initiatives such as management disaster exercises and military observer programs? In 2024 the ARF proposed a regional mechanism for crisis communication which if implemented could as a hotline for North and South Korea to prevent accidental conflicts. Moreover, ASEAN's principle of non-interference is advantageous because it allows both Koreas to engage without the fear of coercion. ASEAN's success in managing regional conflict, such as its role in resolving the Cambodian conflict in the 1990s, demonstrates its potential to mediate on the Korean Peninsula. However, ASEAN’s efforts are not without significant challenges. Politically the deep-seated animosity and mistrust between North and South Korea hinder dialogue. North Korea often views initiatives as multilateral with suspicion, fearing they serve as tools for international isolation. Additionally, within ASEAN there is a lack of consensus on how to engage North Korea. For instance, countries like Indonesia and Vietnam maintain diplomatic relations with Pyongyang while others such as the Philippines align more closely with U.S. policies. Economic challenges persist also primarily due to international sanctions on North Korea under United Nations Security Council resolutions. These sanctions limit ASEAN’s ability to promote economic cooperation restricting projects to engagement of humanitarian assistance. Security concerns are equally daunting with North Korea’s ongoing nuclear weapons program remaining a major obstacle to regional peace. In 2024 North Korea conducted missile tests that heightened tensions and fragile environment security. Lastly, ASEAN's interference policy, while a cornerstone of its diplomacy, limits its ability to intervene directly or mediate in Korean disputes. Despite obstacles, there are opportunities for ASEAN to overcome challenges that contribute to peace on the Peninsula of Korea. By strengthening ASEAN-led platforms such as ARF and East Asia Summit (EAS) ASEAN can sustain dialogue engagement between the two Koreas. ASEAN's economic engagement through humanitarian aid, educational exchanges, and public health cooperation not only circumvents sanctions but also fosters trust. Additionally, ASEAN’s ability to work externally with partners such as China the United States and Japan through the ASEAN+3 mechanism can enhance its influence and coordination in addressing the Korean Peninsula issues. In conclusion, ASEAN holds substantial potential to support peace on the Korean Peninsula through economic cooperation, confidence-building measures, and de-escalation strategies. Despite ongoing challenges like political divisions, sanctions, and security concerns, ASEAN's experience in regional diplomacy and its neutral stance position it as a credible facilitator for dialogue and cooperation. By leveraging existing platforms and fostering multilateral partnerships, ASEAN can help reduce tensions and establish a foundation for lasting peace between North and South Korea. The road to peace is arduous for ASEAN but’s consistent engagement and commitment to dialogue can play a crucial role in promoting stability on the Korean Peninsula.

Trump Lacks The Minerals For Ukraine Deal	By Aurélie Pugnet (EurActiv) -- Volodymyr Zelenskyy's rejection of Donald Trump's offer to trade US military aid for access to half of Ukraine's critical raw materials has teed up a back-and-forth neogtiation that could become key to peace talks. The US president has honed in on the mineral riches of Ukraine, just as he has done with Greenland. In both cases, he has used the US's military might to try and stack the odds in his favour. While he refused to take an invasion of Greenland off the table, in the case of Ukraine Trump has used military support as a bargaining chip to coax the Ukranians into surrendering vast amounts of their critical raw materials – possibly to the value of $500 billion, he said on Tuesday. But a deal has so far eluded even the world's most self-assured negotiator. Though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had initially signalled interest in an arrangement, on Saturday the Ukrainian answer was 'no'. A 50-50 deal in which the US would take half the country's raw minerals was unsatisfactory for Kyiv, the Financial Timesreported.Ukraine ranks in the world's top 10 suppliers of mineral resources. The main issue in exploiting them is that most of the deposits are located in the east of the country, close to or in Russian-controlled territory. Zelenskyy is, however, pressed for time when it comes to military aid – and not just because the US wants a deal done in 'days and weeks,' not months. At the moment, the country’s forces struggle to make any significant advancement on the battlefield, a pre-requisite if they are to have the upper hand in any negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy is at a crossroads, as his army heavily relies on US military aid. The US provided 40% of all support last year, even despite the Republicans in the US senate blocking deliveries of fighter jets, air defence systems and long-range weapons.If Zelenskyy's efforts to entice Trump into a reasonable arrangement on raw minerals were sucessful, the floodgates could open for massive flows of weapons to Kyiv. According to the Financial Times, Zelenskyy is also interested in doing similar minerals-for-weapons deals with European countries, alongside the US. Europe has so far been relegated by the US to planning post-deal security guarantees, with no seat at the table in talks. A domestic bargaining chip Many of Trump's Republican allies have stood against more aid to Ukraine, in a nod to the views of their voting base. But the influential Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the mineral deal's major advocates, said on a panel in Munich on Saturday that a trademark Trump quid pro quo could see the American public get on board with keeping the aid tap running. 'President Trump can go to the American people and say 'Ukraine is not a burden, it is a benefit'', Graham said. 'They are sitting on top of a trillion dollars worth of minerals that we can benefit from… I do know [Putin] is going after the money, don’t let him steal what Ukraine has to enrich itself'. 'If those agreements happen, it's a nightmare for Putin because we have something to defend that we did not have before', he added. He did not explicitly mention the significant opportunity that such a deal would present for US industry – whose support is vital for the likes of Graham, up for re-election in 2026. Nonetheless, Zelenskyy seemed to agree with the latter part of Graham's assessment on Friday. 'We need to protect Ukraine and our resources,' he said. 'Why do we need to protect them? So that they do not fall into the hands of Russia and their allies.' Ukraine to compete against China and Russia? The critical nature of Ukraine's raw materials comes from surging demand as key components in vital technologies, especially for space, defence and electric vehicles. Control over those will give Western countries a major competitive advantage, especially against Russia and China. Despite the vice president's assertions to the contrary on Friday, the US administration sees China as the 'real' bad guy, said a source in direct contact with senior US officials. The NATO military alliance has listed 12 critical materials 'essential' for the defence industry, for a whole range of products, from fighter aircraft to missiles and submarines. Aluminium and graphite are on top of the list of at-risk supplies. China, the largest global and EU supplier of critical raw materials, cut off exports to the US of gallium and germanium in December. It already requires foreign importers to explain to the Chinese government how such materials should be used. Even though the US has alternative suppliers, Western countries are looking for reliable trade partners to guarantee them visibility in supply. When it comes to the environmental risks, they seem to be a secondary thought. 'If I have to choose between the threat of contaminating these territories with Russia or contaminating them with the byproducts of exploration of raw materials, I would definitely go for the second option,' former Ukrainian Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRadj5xVOforT	2025-02-16T16:13:42-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: Challenges For New Chairperson Of The ...	Saturday the 15th of February 2025 will go into the annals of the history of the Horn of Africa States region. It marks the election of the first leader from the region to become the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. It is the main office of the Union which manages and runs the day-to-day affairs of the organization, which brings together some 55 member states, the largest grouping of countries in the world. Djibouti’s Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf was elected in a secret ballot and replaces the outgoing AU Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat of Chad. Mr. Youssouf was Djibouti’s foreign minister since 2005. He inherits an organization which has many bags full of troubles around the continent from its east to its west, from its north to its south and, indeed, in its center. These include among others the following main challenges: Streamlining the Regional Blocs H.E. Mahmoud Youssouf has ahead of him many challenges but the first is perhaps realigning the current regional infrastructure of the continent. He was elected on the basis of a set structure of the continent which composes of five regions – the Western region, the eastern region, the northern region, the southern region and the central region. Yet there are eight and growing other regional blocs, which sometimes overlap each other in the continent. This presents a confused map of the continent and complicates its administration, the job he is to do over the next four years. It looks mostly like quicksand the way these regions are structured. They include the ECOWAS of West Africa, which has now given an offshoot called the Alliance of the Sahel States. There is the SADC of Southern Africa, the EAC of East Africa, the Arab Maghreb Union, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), and of course the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), with a potential offshoot of this organization, the Horn of Africa States (HAS) region. Many countries are in multiple regional blocs, and this does not make sense, if one has to manage a streamlined organization. Economic Development The continent is said to be poor, but its poverty is not related to its rich natural resources both above soil and sub-soil and in its oceans and seas. It is mostly mismanagement, wars (civil or otherwise) and, of course, foreign interferences of different kinds, be it religious terrorism or mercenaries, and hypocritical aid. The United Nations reports that the continent holds some 30 per cent of all natural minerals, 12 per cent of all oil reserves and 8 per cent of natural gas. It is said to hold 40 percent of the world’s gold reserves and up to 90 percent of its platinum and chromium reserves (Al Jazeera.com – Mapping Africa’s Natural resources). The continent is home to some 1.5 billion youthful population which is still growing. These present themselves as both a large market and a large source of labor. It should not be a poor continent, and there it is, a more serious challenge for the newly elected and younger Chairperson. He has to work hard and put a lot of efforts in improving the economic status of the continent and bargaining for more reasonable returns for its natural resources in the place of dependency on foreign aid from other continents. There should be a revisit of the status quo. When the economic imbalances of the continent are corrected, the instabilities and the political upheavals of the continent will naturally disappear or be reduced drastically. It is all related to surviving from Dinosauric times to the present. Most troubles in the continent are rooted in the unequal distribution of the small economic pie that is currently available, as a result of mismanagement and wrong leaderships. It is where a common bargaining tool, the African Union, which he has just taken over, becomes a relevant organization than has hitherto been the case. It is a tough job ahead. Correcting the AU financing Capital is the original source of finance for any organization, be it private or public. Private businesses raise enough capital before they launch any business venture and public organizations raise capital through taxes to deliver the services they are supposed to deliver to a country. When there is a shortfall, different organizations raise the required capital and financing for a job through different means. Private business may raise capital and invite new investors through issuance of new shares or borrow from credit institutions at a price. Public organizations do also borrow or may raise taxes. International organizations are funded through the contributions of the member states, which should include a new heading in their budgets for the amounts they are supposed to pay and/or agreed that each country should pay and they should pay! It is a responsibility they have taken and they must fulfill their obligations. The African Union and many other African organizations are created in the hope that other countries will finance them not only for their economic initiatives, but even for their administrative machineries. This what has failed many African organizations, including the African Union. It is reported that approximately 75% of financing of the African Union’s financing come from foreign sources including European, American, and other countries. The 55 African member states hardly pay or pay little to the activities of the AU. How do they expect it to succeed in its endeavors? Do they expect the elected leaders, Mr. Youssouf, in this instance, to carry a begging bowl and go around the world to beg for more? This is a challenge, which H.E. Chairperson Youssouf will have to address, to ensure that governments in Africa should include in their budgets a heading with respect to the contributions they should be making and this should be a function of the financial needs of the organization, whether these are related to its administration or other initiatives on which the institution is working on. Financial independence of the African Union is a must. How much the new chairperson will deliver of the works in this respect will, of course, depend on how much effort he and his team will put on this matter. Avoiding the Old Pitfalls Most African leaders are kept busy on dealing with security issues, delivery of democratic values and other benign issues that do not add one iota to the lives of people. On the contrary, they only cause more problems. Should there be a better economic and financial infrastructure, better employment opportunities and educational and health services, most people would mind their lives and their businesses. It is when these are not delivered that volatility and violence, two issues which mark the continent, arise and keep leaders of the continent busy and occupied. The new chairperson would be well advised if he avoids these old pitfalls. He would also do better if he truly works on securing adequate and sustainable financing from the member states of the African Union. The member countries can provide such funding for they have the funds but waste it either on personal enrichments or other personal gains or in accounts beyond the reach of the continent in other continents – Dubai, London, Paris or Geneva and more recently in Shanghai and other Asian cities. Africa is a young continent when one looks at its population. The new Chairperson of the African continent should cater for the needs of that population. It is one of the main reasons the new chairperson was elected, as he was seen to be much younger than his rival from Kenya, more vigorous and more in line with the growing youthful population and leaders of the continent, who know what they want and have the capacity to attain and achieve them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRWi-9s6TRpQW	2025-02-16T16:10:29-08:00	
Gaza: Which Country Has Best Claim? – OpEd	President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed reporters at the White House last week, during which the president laid out his plan for the US to 'take over' Gaza. The president elaborated further that his plan is to temporarily relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries during rebuilding efforts of up to 10 years and redevelop the war-torn enclave into what he described as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Before Trump proceeds, the issue of which country has the best claim to Gaza must be established. The Gaza Strip (roughly the size of Washington DC) was occupied in turn by the Ottoman Empire until 1917 and the British Empire until 1948. It forms the smaller of two territories inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. The other is the ancient land of Israel (Samaria and Judea) – termed the 'West Bank' by the international community and inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. Subsequent to the creation of Israel by the UN in 1948, Egypt controlled Gaza for nearly two decades. After Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War against 3 Arab nations which attacked it, Israel (having fought a purely defensive war) invoked its legal right (under customary international law at the time – prior to UN Resolution 242) to claim Gaza and the 'West Bank' as its territories. Israel, therefore, gained legal control over them. For the next 38 years, it controlled the strip and pursued the construction of 21 Jewish settlements there. Two Questions Before Trump proceeds, the issue of who has the best claim to Gaza must be established. There are two pivotal questions that must first be answered if Trump is to follow through with his plans for Gaza. An appropriate response to either of these could lead to his gaining legal control over that coastal enclave. The first interrogative deals with borders: What were the borders of Israel when it was first established? What defines this is the borders at the moment of independence. Israel was created, like many countries, after a successful war where no one came to its aid. In international law, there is a clear rule regarding the establishment of new countries: The country’s borders are determined in accordance with the borders of the previous political entity in that area. So, what legal entity existed before Israel – the British Mandate. And what were the established borders of the British Mandate? From the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. The UN General Assembly’s declaration on November 29, 1947, was a 'recommendation for partition' rather than an operative resolution. What actually defined the situation was what the Mandate did, and it neither accepted the recommendations nor put them into force. During Israel's War of Independence, Jordan and Egypt conquered territories from Israel illegally (by aggression – in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter). It was almost universally agreed that neither Jordan nor Egypt had any legitimate claim of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria (West Bank) or Gaza – Israel did. When Israel liberated the territories in 1967 – a fortiori – it renewed its control over lands that it had sovereignty over based on the original Mandatory borders and consistent with international law. Gaza and the West Bank are not occupied territories. These are lands over which Israel has sovereign claims. In fact, there are many examples where a nation has sovereignty, but it provides a uniquely different governing arrangement with one of its territories. One example is American Samoa. It has its own administration, but without independence. The residents don’t have citizenship, and they can’t vote in U.S. elections. The second question that could be answered affirmatively for Trump to proceed is: Does the UN recognize the inherent right of self-defense if an armed attack occurred and there is loss of territory by the aggressor nation to the defending state? The signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945 marked a turning point in the international legal order. Two key provisions of the Charter influenced the discourse on territorial conquest: Article 2(4): Prohibited the use or threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Article 51: Recognized the inherent right of self-defense if an armed attack occurred. While these provisions emphasized the importance of territorial integrity, they did not explicitly prohibit land acquired in self-defense. By remaining silent on the matter, this left land acquisition ambiguous, especially when defensive wars were deemed necessary to ensure national security. Customary International Law Customary international law, historically, treated defensive wars as an exception to the total prohibition on territorial conquest. A state acting in self-defense could retain captured territory essential to its future security. This view was used to legitimize territorial acquisitions following defensive conflicts. Despite the growing focus on territorial integrity, legal precedents before 1967 demonstrated the legitimacy of territorial gain in defensive wars. For instance: World War II Aftermath The Allied Powers justified retaining or redistributing territory for security reasons, such as the division of Germany and the annexation of parts of Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union. China and Tibet China asserted control over Tibet after a military invasion in 1950, formalizing its claim through the Seventeen Point Agreement in 1951 India and Goa India’s annexation of Goa from Portugal was defended as a measure of self-defense, reflecting how states could have territorial acquisition in defensive terms. Indonesia and West Papua Following military pressure and a UN-brokered agreement, Indonesia took control of West Papua from the Netherlands under the 1962 New York Agreement. Israel’s Defensive Wars The 1948 Arab-Israeli War offers a notable example of how international law treated territorial gains resulting from defensive wars before the Six-Day War. Following its War of Independence, Israel retained territory beyond the boundaries outlined in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. While armistice agreements established ceasefire lines, they were not recognized as formal borders but indicated a degree of acceptance of territorial realities resulting from defensive actions. As the only emerging state after the end of the British Mandate and based on the principle of Uti possidetis juris the entire territory between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea is sovereign Israeli territory, according to customary international law. The Six-Day War marked a watershed moment in the discourse on land conquest in defensive wars. Israel, acting in preemptive self-defense, captured Judea, Samaria, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights. The international response dealt more with political agendas regarding the Middle East and oil than any basis in law. The result was UN Security Council Resolution 242 – declaring the 'inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,' reflecting the shift toward a rejection of Israel's right to defensive acquisition of territory. Before 1967, international law treated the conquest of land in defensive wars with notable ambiguity. While aggressive conquest was increasingly condemned, defensive wars often provided a legal basis upon which states justified territorial acquisitions. Yet, even after 1967, there are several examples where the UN did not strongly condemn territorial acquisitions, even when they were framed as 'defensive actions.' These include: Turkey's Invasion of Cyprus (1974): After a Greek-led coup in Cyprus, Turkey invaded the northern part of the island, citing self-defense and the protection of Turkish Cypriots. While the UN condemned the invasion and called for a ceasefire, it did not demand that Turkey withdraw immediately. This evolution of customary international jurisprudence reflects a double standard in the commitment to territorial integrity, peaceful conflict resolution, and the rule of law. Understanding this historical trajectory reveals politically driven inconsistencies in sovereignty under international law. Yet, the answer to the first question is controlling and sufficient to provide the basis for recognition of Gaza as Israeli territory. A country’s borders are determined in accordance with the borders of the previous political entity in that area. Even with the subsequentpromulgation of 242, when Israel liberated the territories (Gaza and the 'West Bank') in 1967, it renewed its control over lands that it had sovereignty over based on the original Mandatory borders: From the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Israel has the best claim to Gaza; thus, Trump needs Israel's acquiescence to legally proceed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRb9UNBIUD0HN	2025-02-16T16:07:27-08:00	
Transatlantic Twilight: European Public Opinion And The Long Shad...	By Jana Puglierin, Arturo Varvelli and Pawel Zerka Lamps going out On the evening of August 3rd 1914, a friend visited the British foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey in his office in London. They gazed out of the windows at the dusk street as the lamplighters moved along it. 'The lamps are going out all over Europe,' commented Grey, as he later observed in his memoirs. 'We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.' To draw comparisons between now and then might seem absurdly catastrophist. After all, Grey was referring to the imminent outbreak of the first world war. And yet that melancholic image captures something of the transatlantic alliance today as Donald Trump settles in for a second presidential term. Where once it burned bright, now it is dimming. The shadows are lengthening. Gloom is setting in—for how long is not yet clear. That, at least, is the mood captured by ECFR’s sweeping poll of Europeans conducted in November (after the US presidential election) and December 2024. It covered 11 EU member states and Switzerland, the UK and Ukraine—as well as ten other countries around the world as part of a wider exercise already covered in a separate ECFR report. Across those 14 European states, the poll found a newly pessimistic and transactional view of the transatlantic partnership. The growing shadows do not fall evenly. In some parts of the continent and its politics—especially its populist right, in power in states like Hungary—affection for the US burns on. Even elsewhere, as it fades, more moderate leaders like Emmanuel Macron in France and Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, rage against the dying of the light. They hope to use their personal ingenuity or charisma to keep the transatlantic flame burning. But as they do so, they should heed the twilight scene that our polling paints, constituted by four main findings. Firstly, Europeans see the US less as an ally sharing the same interests and values, and more as a necessary partner with whom they must strategically cooperate. They are broadly aligned on this, but the poll also finds evidence that respondents of different political outlooks view Trump quite differently. That could point to divisions on the sort of transatlantic relationship that they would like to see in future. Secondly, Europeans are largely united in expecting Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, a significant shift over the second half of 2024. But here too, the pattern of light and shade is uneven. Views on what those negotiations should entail and what approach to the theatre Europe should adopt in the long term vary greatly, in ways European leaders must heed if Trump increases the pressure for talks. Thirdly, a similar picture of division is already visible on China policy. Views among Europeans vary significantly and do not correlate neatly with views on America or Trump. That gives the US administration room to exploit differences. Finally, Europeans tend to see the EU in a gloomier light than most counterparts elsewhere in the world. But few believe that darkness has fallen entirely. Between the groups most optimistic and pessimistic about the union’s prospects and power are two other camps that recognise shades of grey. As the glow of the transatlantic alliance fades, leaders can turn to those groups for support as they seek to illuminate Europe’s own path. Twilight is usually understood as the period just after the sunset, when the light is fading. Technically speaking, however, it corresponds to any time of day when the sun is just below the horizon. Thus it can also refer to the dawn: the moment before a new day. That very ambiguity well describes current relations between Europe and America. The old Atlanticism is disappearing. But a new one will need to be born—either soon, or after a long night. For leaders favourable to European interests and cooperation, this marks an opportunity to set transatlantic relations on a new footing. It is a chance to make Europe a more autonomous, flexible and, ultimately, more secure and self-confident partner. But if Europeans allow Trump to transfix and divide them, they will cede the task of lighting a way forward to a new, nationalist, MAGA-style transatlantic project already emerging, confident, from the shadows. An unsentimental Atlanticism ECFR’s poll shows Europeans converging in their perceptions of the US. The most common view is that the US is not an 'ally' but rather a 'necessary partner' with which Europeans must strategically cooperate. This is even true in traditional Atlanticist strongholds—like Poland and Denmark—that one-and-a half years earlier saw the US primarily as an ally. Though our polling cannot confirm causality, we contend that Trump’s political return and ultimate election victory may be the main contributing factor. A notable sub-trend within this is that supporters of Europe’s far-right parties, many of them traditionally sceptical about the transatlantic alliance, buck the continental trend—but not all. Supporters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party now see the US in a more positive light, but attitudes among supporters of France’s National Rally (RN) remain largely unchanged. This reflects the parties’ leaders: Alice Weidel, the AfD’s chancellor candidate, welcomed Trump’s re-election with warm words, but the RN’s Marine Le Pen was more subdued in her reaction A more consistent shift is seen in the European political mainstream. Supporters of parties like the Christian Democrats (CDU), Social Democrats (SPD), and Greens in Germany, the Socialists (PSOE) in Spain, or Macron’s Renaissance in France have all revised their perception of America downwards since 2023. Further evidence suggesting that Trump’s election is part of this shift comes from respondents’ disinclination to view this event positively. In ECFR’s recent global polling paper authors Timothy Garton Ash, Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard noted that, among respondents from all over the world, Europeans are the least likely to consider Trump’s re-election a good thing for American citizens. Alongside South Koreans, they are also the least likely to consider it a good thing for their countries and peace in the world. There are differences between and within European countries—especially between supportive respondents in south-eastern Europe and detractors in northern and western parts. But the average European citizen is more likely to be pessimistic than optimistic about Trump’s return—on all three accounts. This apprehension could create the basis for a pragmatic European approach to the US over the next four years—neither starry-eyed nor entirely rejectionist—that commands broad majorities in most societies. But there is clear scope for greater divergence among Europeans over time if the internal political differences sharpen. For the moment, our polling shows that supporters of (for example) the AfD and RN chiefly see the US as Europe’s partner—rather than close ally. That restrained enthusiasm for the transatlantic alliance may be rooted in those parties’ traditional view that it is an elite project—the realm of NATO summits and Davos round tables—alien to ordinary European voters. But a Trump presidency that draws the European far-right closer, both personally and ideologically, could change that. After all, present in Washington for the inauguration on January 20th were few conventional European figures, but rather the likes of Giorgia Meloni, Viktor Orban, and the AfD’s Tino Chrupalla. Trump’s speech evoked favourite topics of those politicians and their European comrades: anti-'wokeism', anti-greenery and anti-migration. Elsewhere Elon Musk, for his part, has established friendships with the Italian prime minister as well as with Weidel. In January he interviewed the latter on X, his social media platform, and later beamed into her party’s election campaign launch to emphasise once again that 'only the AfD can save Germany.' This nascent realignment within Europe is seen, in ECFR’s poll, in the political breakdown of respondents’ optimism about Trump’s re-election. Most upbeat are supporters of right-wing populist parties: for example, not even a fifth of voters for Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) and Confederation (Konfederacja) parties, or Meloni’s Brothers of Italy (FdI), believe his re-election is a 'bad thing' for American voters, their own country, or peace in the world. Supporters of the AfD and RN are more split, with pluralities believing Trump’s election is a bad thing for their countries. But overall, our findings hold out the possibility that, while some lights go out on the traditional, mainstream European commitment to the transatlantic relationship, new ones start to flicker on what have until recently been the European margins. If Trump hits Europe with tariffs that hurt working-class European voters, or if his peace plan for Ukraine turns out be a disaster, he may lose some of the good will from the European far-right that he currently seems to enjoy. But for the moment, the trend points to a warm glow between Trump and his European followers, which could well evolve into a new, MAGA-style Atlanticism. United on Ukraine talks, divided on what comes next Arguably the most pressing transatlantic topic as the new Trump term gets underway is how the president acts on Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine. The president has indicated that he will pressure both sides to negotiate. That, combined with Ukraine’s struggles on the battlefield, could explain why the most prevalent expectation among European publics is a 'compromise settlement' between Kyiv and Moscow. This was the leading view in every country polled, including more hawkish ones like Estonia, Denmark, Poland, the UK and indeed Ukraine itself—where previous polls found greater confidence about Ukrainian victory. That could bode well for achieving common European positions on any such talks. But the backdrop—the transatlantic twilight that has set in since the US election campaign and result—colours that view. Europeans are broadly sceptical about the returning president’s peace-making efforts. In half of the countries polled, absolute majorities of respondents (or, in the case of France, 49%) believe that reaching peace in Ukraine will either become less likely under Trump or remain as unlikely as it was before. Admittedly, only a minority of respondents believe Trump will reduce the chance of peace in Ukraine; just 26% on average across the 11 EU countries polled. And in several European countries—not just in generally Trump-positive Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, but also in Estonia, Italy and Ukraine itself—quite a few people believe that he will make it more likely. But the overall picture is darker. In several countries, many of those who consider peace negotiations as the 'most likely' outcome of the war do not consider this the 'best' outcome for their own countries or for peace in the world. The tendency is particularly strong in northern Europe. There, respondents tend to believe that it would be better for Ukraine to win and, consequently, many of them want Europe to support Kyiv to continue fighting instead of pushing it to negotiate. In other words, pluralities (and in some cases, majorities) of respondents anticipate that Russia’s war in Ukraine will end in negotiations. But they do not necessarily trust Trump to help with that or to further the wider cause of peace globally. In some cases, they do not believe talks now are even desirable. There is therefore significant potential for transatlantic and intra-European splits, especially if negotiations either fail entirely or drift towards an outcome highly unfavourable to Ukraine. Within Europe the main rift is between countries that are keen to support Kyiv in continuing its fight (like Denmark, Estonia, Poland and the UK) and those that would rather push it towards peace negotiations. The latter are further divided between a select few (like Spain) where many would prefer to invite Ukraine to NATO first and others (especially Bulgaria and Hungary) where the largest group of respondents would rather push Kyiv to negotiate without such an offer. Those divisions should concern anyone who sees the need for a common European position on Ukraine—especially given the arrival of a less predictable and amicable partner in the White House. So too should divides that would matter particularly in the event that a peace deal is indeed reached between Kyiv and Moscow. Poll respondents in some countries (most notably, Bulgaria and Hungary again) are already fairly Russia-positive and tend to believe that Ukraine bears some, most, or all of the blame for the war’s continuation thus far. This points to the possibility that, after any peace deal, those countries’ governments would seek a reset with Russia that others (like Poland or Germany) might find unpalatable. Another question that could arise in that event—if not as part of the negotiations themselves—is Ukraine’s future integration into the EU. There too the scope for division is obvious, with a wide range of views on whether the country is even part of Europe. That around half of respondents even in two big western states, France and Italy, doubt this should be a particular concern to supporters of that integration process. The China conundrum If the poll makes it all-too-easy to imagine how Europe’s divisions over Ukraine could prevent it from establishing common positions towards Trump’s Washington, the same could also be true of China. At the time of writing, the president has fired the opening salvo of a new trade war with Beijing, imposing a sweeping 10% tariff on Chinese imports. He is also threatening the EU with tariffs. Does Europe, however unsentimentally, align with the president on China in order to placate him? Or does it turn to China as a new beacon as the transatlantic glow fades? Our poll suggests that neither course would enjoy resounding support among Europeans. True, a plurality of respondents agree that China is a 'necessary partner' more than an ally, rival or adversary. But the proportions vary greatly, with southern Europeans most positive towards it (perhaps a reflection of perceived economic advantages) and northern Europeans more dubious (perhaps the sign of cautionary lessons learned about interdependence with China, especially in Germany’s and Denmark’s cases.) Our poll also finds a slight negative shift in views towards China since May 2023 in countries like Denmark, France, Germany and Poland. That appears to reflect Europe’s ongoing reassessment of its relationship with the Asian giant, including a shift in emphasis at the EU level towards 'de-risking.' At the World Economic Forum summit in Davos on January 21st, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, advocated 'a more balanced relationship with China' overcoming 'economic imbalances.' Her address evoked a Europe capable of making its own choices on the relationship rather than (implicitly) being pressed into a course of action by either Washington or Beijing. Yet the poll also points to the challenges in doing so if, for example, Trump pressures Europeans to join the US in ratcheting up pressure on Beijing. Some of the most China-sceptic countries are also some of the most Trump-sceptic (though Germans are also divided internally, reflecting the varying interests and outlooks of the country’s different industrial sectors). Meanwhile some of those states most open to China, particularly in southern and eastern Europe, are most upbeat about Trump. Finding a consistent European way forward will therefore be difficult. Even if that middle way involves a transactional bargain—ongoing American security for Europe in return for some European support on China—this will strain elements of public opinion in much of the continent. The alternative, of course, is that Europe fails to find any such common position and allows others, whether Washington, Beijing, or both, to set its course. Avoiding that will mean preparing, and preparing electorates, for negotiation and compromise. From gloom to shades of grey Can Europeans light their own path forward during the era of Trump 2.0? The poll suggests a profound lack of self-confidence. Most respondents are either sceptical of the EU’s power, or believe the union could collapse within the next 20 years, or both. As such, they see the EU in a gloomier light than respondents in most of the rest of the world, as ECFR’s recent global polling report showed. Absolute majorities in Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa believe that the EU will have much more or somewhat more influence in the world over the next decade. By contrast, that expectation is shared by only 29% in the EU (taking an average across the 11 EU countries polled) and even smaller contingents in the UK and Switzerland. There are, however, differences within Europe. Notably, respondents in geographically marginal states outside the old core of the European project—Estonia, Portugal, Romania and Spain—see the EU’s power shining more brightly than counterparts in France, Germany and Italy. One possible interpretation of this finding is that newer and (in the past, at least) peripheral members are more likely to see the EU as strengthening their own voices in the world and helping to compensate for the limitations of national governments. Another, more dispiriting interpretation is that Europe’s old core is closer to the realities of the EU’s limitations and its struggle to reconcile national differences. To capture fully this complex picture, it helps to segment European citizens into four different groups reflecting their views of both the EU’s resilience and its great-power potential. Those who believe that the EU is a great power, and that its collapse is unlikely, are the largest camp, constituting 29% of the public, on average, in the 14 European countries polled. This group is particularly big in Denmark, Estonia, Portugal and Spain. Only in one country, France, does its size fall below 20%. We call these citizens 'Euro-optimists.' They dominate in the electorates of Macron’s Renaissance, Spain’s governing PSOE and its opposition Popular Party (PP), and the German Greens. But taken alone, this group’s sunny disposition would not be enough to light the EU’s way. The second-largest camp (22% on average) sees shadows consuming the union. It comprises those believing that the EU both is not a power and is doomed to collapse. We call them the 'Euro-pessimists.' They are preeminent in the electorates of some of the most radical far-right or otherwise Eurosceptic parties, like the AfD, RN, PiS, Confederation, as well as Orban’s Fidesz, and Vox in Spain. In five EU members from our sample—Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary and Poland—they make up at least a quarter of the national population. Between the bright outlook of the Euro-optimists and the despondency of the Euro-pessimists are two groups that need to be taken into consideration and that reflect different combinations of light and shade. Members of the third camp, the 'Euro-realists', have perhaps the least dramatic perspective. They do not think the EU is bound to collapse, but do not see it as a great power either. On average, they account for one sixth (17%) of the population in the European countries polled, and are particularly present in Denmark, Germany, Italy and Poland. This group is rarely ever the single-largest camp among any one political party’s electorate. But it is a significant contingent in several of the most powerful parties in the EU, from the CDU and SPD in Germany to Meloni’s FdI and Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition in Poland. Unlike the Euro-pessimists, many of the Euro-realists believe the EU’s power will grow in the future. This might suggest that, for them, the EU is simply not a great power yet. Alongside 'Euro-optimists', they are often (especially in Germany, Poland and the UK, among others) of the opinion that Europe should support Ukraine in continuing its fightback against Russia rather than pushing for peace talks. The fourth camp, which we call 'Euro-mortalists', is a mirror image of the Euro-realists. It is composed of people who believe the EU is vulnerable to collapse but, at the same time, view it as a great power comparable to the US or China. They are thus likely to agree with Macron when he warned at the Sorbonne in April 2024 that the EU is mortal and could die, because its geopolitical awakening is too slow and weak amid the 'generalised rearmament of the world'. This group accounts, on average, for 11% of the European populations polled, with particularly high numbers in Bulgaria, Portugal and Romania. But they do not dominate in any country or party. Identifying these shades of grey may help Europeans avoid shades of Grey (he of the catastrophist 'lamps going out' observation in 1914). In other words, as twilight settles over the transatlantic relationship and neither luminous boosterism nor the darkest fatalism offer viable ways forward, the nuances of the Euro-realists and Euro-mortalists may help light that path. By drawing them together with those Euro-optimists most confident about Europe’s future, pragmatic leaders can build broad majorities in favour of concerted action. Hopeful but grounded; aware of the limits of European power but not imprisoned by them; cognisant of the EU’s mortality but not transfixed by it: such nuances show the way. In a speech to France’s ambassadors on 6th January 2025, Macron warned against succumbing to a 'spirit of defeat'. This is as much of an imperative—avoiding Europe succumbing to its own shadows—as his earlier warning about the eventual death of the EU. The answer is found in reconciling the two. Glimpses of a new dawn If Grey’s 'lamps going out' comment resonates today, that is not necessarily because the world is on the brink of war, even though escalating conflict and big-power rivalry are a significant part of the crepuscular backdrop. More precisely, it captures the sense of the lights going out on a fading order born on the second world war battlefields of Europe and enshrined in the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. For decades, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have subscribed to the form—and broadly, the substance—of a values-based partnership of committed allies with deep shared interests. Donald Trump, along with the wider shift away from established Western liberalism, is putting an end to all that. Already in his first term in office he referred to the EU as a 'foe' and Brussels as being 'like a hellhole'. Since then, his willingness to tear up institutional conventions and norms has only grown. His 'America first' designs on Greenland, his demand that NATO partners spend 5% of GDP on defence and his moves towards unilateral trade tariffs (initially on others, seemingly with the EU up next) all confirm it. Darkness does indeed seem to be falling for some as-yet indeterminate period stretching into the future. This paper has made one argument with two sides. On the one side, it has made the case for recognising that the old transatlantic light is failing; that interests and values in America and Europe are diverging and that romantic notions about the Atlantic community have had their day. It has shown that European publics recognise that—whether they regret this or, in the case of Europe’s own rising radical right especially, view it as a positive. On the other side, we have argued for seeing the light and shade. Europe’s future is not uniformly dark, it is not doomed to succumb to Trump’s will, and the continent has a reasonable degree of agency over what comes next. America’s president sees everything as negotiable, so Europeans need to be ready to negotiate hard in support of their interests—on Russia and Ukraine, Europe’s disposition towards China, or its wider security and prosperity. Readers should take away from this paper a sober sense of the deep divisions the polling exposes, and their vulnerability to exploitation by a Trump administration whose disdain for European cooperation and integration is obvious. The risks of bilateralised relations, fragmentation, and even paralysis are real. Leaders should guard against them assiduously rather than seeking short-term gains by, for example, breaking with common European positions. No European country has the strength to deal on equal terms with the US administration. And European political and economic interests are so interlinked that one country’s problems will almost inevitably become problems for others, too. But it is on the opportunities, those bright spots in the darkness, that this paper concludes. ECFR’s polling shows room for collaboration across a broad coalition of voters that see Europe’s power and resilience (as well as its relationships with the US and China) in somewhat different ways, but not without hope. By bringing together Euro-optimists, Euro-realists and Euro-mortalists especially, leaders can rally together those Europeans with at least some degree of faith in the project. The weeks since Trump’s second election win have brought glimpses of European leaders, in Brussels and national capitals alike, grasping towards those coalitions. The French, German and Polish governments—whose political bases are dominated by 'Euro-optimists' and 'Euro-realists'—have started exploring new diplomatic formats based on their 'Weimar triangle', but also taking in Italy and in some cases Spain. Poland, the Nordic countries and the UK are working towards a coalition of forces aimed at sustaining Ukraine’s fightback. Even Meloni has declared herself willing to play a constructive bridging role between a demoralised Europe and an antagonistic Trump on topics like tariffs. A new emphasis on ambitious but hard-nosed collective action also marks recent interventions by EU leaders and upcoming developments like the European Commission’s white paper on defence. Speaking in Davos, von der Leyen announced that the EU would be pragmatic towards Trump’s US, but would 'always stand by our principles; to protect our interests and uphold our values.' Antonio Costa, the new European Council president, has told the EU ambassadors that 'despite geopolitical challenges, this is not a world for us to despair, but a world with opportunities for the European Union.' Their contribution, as well as that of Mark Rutte as NATO secretary general, will be vital to shaping European responses alongside national leaders. The transatlantic twilight is a moment of opportunity and clarification. It forces European leaders to relearn the art of pragmatism in foreign policy. It allows them to clarify to their voters the stakes associated with the different kinds of peace for Ukraine, and with Europe’s excessive dependency on the US for security. And it may let pro-European parties renew their bonds with voters by distinguishing themselves from the Trumpian far-right. All of that, however, will require a mix of practicality and creativity. It also allows Europeans to take the lead in moulding a new transatlantic relationship. This might well be less ideals- and values-based than what came before, and more based on calculations of concrete benefits. It will probably be a more distant one, in which Europe must more often defend its interests when they come under pressure from American actions. And it will certainly need to be one with more European leadership, initiative and responsibility for the continent’s own fate. There is not just peril but also possibility in this reset. The twilight can yet become a new dawn. Methodology This report is based on a public opinion poll of adult populations (aged 18 and over) conducted in November 2024 in 14 European countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United Kingdom). The overall sample included 18,507 respondents. The polls were conducted by Datapraxis and YouGov in Bulgaria (1,014; 7-29 November); Denmark (1,099; 7-26 November); France (2,017; 7 November-2 December); Germany (2,003; 7-28 November); Hungary (1,023; 7-28 November); Italy (1,531; 7-29 November); Poland (1,063; 7-29 November); Portugal (1,000; 7-27 November); Romania (1,010; 7-26 November); Spain (1,030; 7-27 November); Switzerland (1,082; 8-26 November), and the UK (2,073; 7-26 November). Polls were conducted by Datapraxis and Norstat in Estonia (1,061; 11 November – 5 December); and by DataPraxis and Rating Group in Ukraine (1,501; 15-20 November). In Ukraine, polls were conducted by DataPraxis and Rating Group (1,501; 15-20 November) via telephone interviews (CATI), with respondents selected using randomly generated telephone numbers. The data was then weighted according to basic demographics. Fully accounting for the population changes due to the war is difficult, but adjustments have been made to account for the territory under Russian occupation. This, combined with the probability-based sampling approach, strengthens the representativeness of the survey and generally reflects the attitudes of Ukrainian public opinion in wartime conditions. The segmentation into different 'EU camps' used in this paper is based on responses to two questions: 'Which of the following best reflects your view on the EU’s global standing?' (a) The EU is a power that can deal on equal terms with global powers, such as the US or China; (b) The EU is NOT a power that can deal on equal terms with global powers, such as the US or China; (c) Don’t know 'Looking ahead, how likely do you think it is that in the next twenty years the European Union will fall apart?' (a) Very likely, (b) Fairly likely, (c) Fairly unlikely, (d) Very unlikely, (e) Don't know Respondents were sorted into four different categories based on the following criteria: 'Euro-optimists'—if they consider the EU a power and think it’s unlikely to fall apart 'Euro-pessimists' —if they consider the EU as NOT a power and think it’s likely to fall apart 'Euro-realists'—if they consider the EU as NOT a power but think it’s unlikely to fall apart 'Euro-mortalists'— if they consider the EU as a power but think it’s likely to fall apart The remaining respondents—who responded 'Don’t know' to at least one of the two questions—were not put into any of these five categories, and were instead considered as 'The rest'.

Is Trump Giving US Companies The Green Light On Bribery? – Analys...	Trump’s suspension of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act turns back the clock 50 years on global anti-corruption efforts. By Peter Fabricius United States (US) President Donald Trump’s executive order this week suspending the operation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) will likely be felt particularly sharply in Africa, where corruption drains about US$10 billion a year. Some estimates are as high as US$140 billion. The FCPA was introduced in 1977 and prohibits US companies and individuals – as well as foreign entities with a US connection – from bribing foreign public officials. The ‘connection’ can be as minor as a telephone call, email or text sent or received from the US in a corrupt business deal, giving the law its broad scope. David Lewis, who founded South Africa’s Corruption Watch, told Currency that the FCPA was ‘the most effective anti-corruption instrument in the world, without a doubt,’ and said suspending it would definitely increase corruption. He was referring mainly to South Africa, but the act has been used to prosecute many cases across Africa. Trump suspended the FCPA for 180 days pending a review of its operations. He said the act had been increasingly ‘stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States.’ It had done so by reducing US companies’ competitiveness in ‘gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure or assets.’ FCPA prohibits US companies, individuals and foreign entities with a US connection, from bribing foreign public officials In other words, Trump was saying the FCPA’s criminalisation of US companies that bribe foreign governments was putting them at a disadvantage against companies from other countries that don’t criminalise bribery. This decision was similar to other orders Trump has issued in his first three weeks in office, slashing restrictions, regulations and other controls on US businesses – and in doing so, putting their interests ahead of those of ordinary people in America and beyond. ‘[The FCPA] was the first law of its kind in the world,’ Transparency International (TI) said this week. It said that by suspending it, Trump had delivered a major blow to the fight against foreign bribery worldwide. ‘It risks undermining decades of progress in tackling cross-border corruption and puts international stability at risk. This pause will work to the advantage of unscrupulous business actors around the world who until now feared US criminal pursuits.’ TI said the US had long been respected as a global leader in foreign bribery enforcement. In 1997 the FCPA was internationalised with the adoption of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention, which now has 46 parties. According to TI Chair François Valérian, ‘US enforcement of the FCPA has long been a gold standard in the fight against corruption. Weakening it will empower wrongdoers and send a dangerous signal that bribery is back on the table. Foreign bribery is by no means, as suggested by last night’s decision, a routine business practice.’ Using the FCPA, the US has long been respected as a global leader in foreign bribery enforcement As an example of FCPA achievements, TI cited a recent case where a multinational mining company was found to have bribed officials in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria to secure lucrative business deals. Since the company was US-listed, authorities could take action for violating the FCPA. This appeared to reference the US Department of Justice (DOJ) case brought against the Swiss-based mining conglomerate Glencore for violations of the FCPA and commodity price manipulation. The DoJ said in 2022 that, among other bribery schemes, between 2007 and 2018, Glencore and its subsidiaries paid about US$79.6 million in bribes to obtain and retain business with state-owned and state-controlled entities in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea. This included corrupt deals to buy crude oil and petrol from Nigeria’s state-owned oil company and to win crude oil contracts. ‘In the DRC, Glencore admitted that it conspired to and did corruptly offer and pay approximately $27.5 million to third parties, while intending for a portion of the payments to be used as bribes to DRC officials, in order to secure improper business advantages,’ the DoJ said. Glencore pleaded guilty and agreed to pay over US$1.1 billion to settle the cases. The FCPA has also been used to prosecute many other cases in Africa. Last December consulting firm McKinsey’s South African subsidiary was ordered to pay over US$122 million to settle an FCPA case in which the company bribed Transnet and Eskom officials to win contracts. This was part of the state capture saga under former president Jacob Zuma. McKinsey South Africa was ordered to pay over US$122 million in an FCPA case relating to Transnet and Eskom In 2023 the multinational mining company Rio Tinto agreed to pay a US$15 million fine under the FCPA for paying US$10.5 million to a Guinean government official to retain certain mining rights in that country. In 2018 the US DoJ used the FCPA to indict Jean Boustani, an executive of the international shipbuilding company Privinvest, for bribing, among others, then Mozambican finance minister Manuel Chang. This was to authorise US$2 billion of loans to Chang’s government to buy patrol and tuna fishing boats. Chang was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering in a New York court last year, and was sentenced to eight and a half years in jail, plus a US$7 million fine, with more to come. Adriano Nuvunga, Director of Mozambique’s Centre for Democracy and Human Rights and former chair of the Forum de Monitoria do Orçamento (Forum for Monitoring the Budget), which pursued Chang in the courts, lamented Trump’s decision to suspend the FCPA. ‘In vulnerable regions like Africa, especially Mozambique’s extractive sector, corruption has long exploited natural resources, damaging local communities,’ he told ISS Today. ‘Mozambique is already suffering from the consequences of corruption – embezzlement, mismanagement, underdevelopment, environmental degradation and widespread poverty. ‘Suspending the FCPA will only encourage further exploitation and corruption without accountability. Instead of promoting transparency and justice, this decision weakens crucial protections for human rights and sustainable development. It’s a dangerous step backward that deserves global condemnation.’ With a stroke of his overworked pen, Trump turned the clock back about half a century to an era when corporations mostly from the industrialised north routinely bribed officials mostly from the developing south to win natural resources or infrastructure contracts. Bribes that some European governments even allowed their companies to claim as tax deductions.

The EU And ASEAN Aim For A Smooth Landing In Aviation Cooperation...	By Louise Shania Sabela The Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement (CATA) between the EU and ASEAN is reshaping air travel between the two major economic regions. CATA is the first-ever air transport agreement negotiated between two regional blocs, replacing more than 140 bilateral air service agreements with a unified framework designed to simplify operations for airlines on both sides. It aims to create a smoother, more integrated aviation market, encouraging better collaboration and increased efficiency. While the vision is ambitious, the path to realising it is not without obstacles — especially for ASEAN. Achieving the vision requires balancing regional integration with national sovereignty. Article 1 of the Chicago Convention (1944) grants every state complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. As the legal foundation for CATA, this principle underscores the rights of individual nations to regulate and control activities within their airspace, including granting or denying access to foreign carriers (Article 6). The convention also ensures fair competition by establishing safeguards against market distortions and emphasising financial transparency among carriers (Article 44(f)). While the Chicago Convention respects each state’s sovereignty and allows them to negotiate access independently, varying national approaches have resulted in challenges for regulatory harmonisation. Under Presidential Regulation No. 12/2016, Indonesia applies the ‘open skies’ framework to only five cities — Jakarta, Bali, Medan, Surabaya and Makassar. This reflects a protectionist policy designed to safeguard domestic airlines, such as Garuda Indonesia, from regional competition. The regulation enables open access to these key airports, but access to other cities remains restricted and subject to bilateral negotiations — even for other ASEAN states. Airlines like AirAsia have had to establish separate regional units in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Their operations are mostly restricted to flights originating from their home countries. ASEAN–Europe connectivity is still largely dependent on country-pair agreements due to fragmented regional aviation policies. This raises questions about how international trade law principles regulate CATA, since CATA aims to improve air travel efficiency and create a more integrated aviation market between Europe and Southeast Asia. Academics argue that CATA is likely to benefit the EU more than ASEAN due to protective aviation regulations, insufficient supply, limited infrastructure and differing priorities in ASEAN countries. This imbalance allows EU carriers greater operational flexibility and strategic reach, while ASEAN airlines remain constrained by national-level restrictions. One of these imbalances is caused by the non-existence of single market regulations in ASEAN. ASEAN is still in the process of developing its ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM), which was initially set to launch in 2015. Two agreements — the Multilateral Agreement on Air Services and the Multilateral Agreement on the Full Liberalisation of Passenger Air Services — have so far been ratified. While this marks progress, other challenges hinder the full optimisation of ASAM. In Indonesia and the Philippines, domestic markets are much larger than international markets. Indonesia’s domestic market alone surpasses the entire international market of Singapore. This disparity is further reflected in the rankings of ASEAN airlines by seat capacity, where carriers from Indonesia dominate. Given these dynamics, airlines from Indonesia and the Philippines naturally prioritise serving their expansive domestic markets. This divergence in market orientation influences their positions in regional aviation negotiations. Unlike the EU, where train and road networks provide connectivity, ASEAN countries rely heavily on aviation to link their markets. Vietnam struggles with insufficient domestic flight routes and a severe shortage of aircraft, both of which threaten to limit its role to that of a destination for international carriers. Vietnam’s airlines also face financial instability, which has led to operational downsizing. Both Pacific Airlines and Bamboo Airways have had to reduce their fleets due to economic pressures. This shortage of aircraft affects the availability of both domestic and international services, further limiting Vietnam’s ability to capitalise on the opportunities presented by CATA. In Laos, airport infrastructure presents a significant challenge. The quality of air transport infrastructure in Laos was rated at 4 on a scale from 1 to 7, in comparison to the global average of 4.55 points. These infrastructure limitations can impede the ASAM from realising its full potential. Singapore has taken the approach of focusing entirely on the international market. Airlines operating from Singapore benefit from unrestricted Fifth Freedom Rights allowing an airline from one country to transport passengers or cargo between two foreign countries as part of its international route, which Singapore has successfully bilaterally negotiated. Singapore’s success shows the potential advantages of more open aviation policies as a model for other ASEAN countries considering deeper cooperation to boost their own aviation sectors. This approach not only enhances connectivity but also stimulates economic growth by attracting more airlines and increasing passenger traffic. To address these challenges, the EU has been actively supporting ASEAN through initiatives like the ARISE Plus Civil Aviation Project. This program focuses on improving regulatory capabilities, aligning safety standards with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines and enhancing air traffic management efficiency across ASEAN member states. The project also aims to establish mechanisms for mutual recognition of certifications and licenses, enabling smoother cross-border operations. Member states must align their aviation policies with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices and commit to transparent, non-discriminatory regulatory practices. The development of an ASEAN Air Traffic Management Master Plan seeks to create a seamless ASEAN sky similar to the EU’s integrated airspace. Investing in infrastructure and developing capacity-building programs are practical steps forward, with the EU’s Global Gateway Initiative providing strategic funding and expertise.

The Emerging Of Close Produce Model In Global Manufacturing – Ana...	By Zhao Zhijiang The impact of the wave of de-globalization on global trade is most directly felt, but its influence on the production and layout models of multinational companies is even more profound. During the peak of globalization, multinational companies focused on 'profit' and pursued profit maximization. However, the global market no longer exists as it once did, and outdated theories are simply ineffective. Therefore, adjustments are inevitable. The question is, how should these adjustments be made? Based on research on the changes in global market space and tracking the process of de-globalization, ANBOUND has proposed a new theory for multinational companies, namely 'close produce'. This theory represents the restructuring and re-layout of large multinational corporations. Regardless of the company, even if they do not adopt this model now, they will eventually follow its path. While supply chain layouts in the future will still prioritize 'profit', 'resilience' will be even more important. The global supply chain restructuring and the widespread adoption of the close produce model by multinational companies are actually not favorable to China's development. This is their voluntary adjustment, driven by an internal motivation to distance themselves from the Chinese market, which can even be seen as another way to explain 'decoupling'. Of course, some Chinese companies expanding overseas are also adopting the same model to expand their growth space. However, geopolitical pressures between the U.S. and China, as well as other factors will create significant uncertainty, disrupting the growth of Chinese companies overseas. I. Supply Chain Adjustments of Multinational Corporations in the Era of De-globalization The statement 'globalization is dead' is not an exaggeration, but an objective reality. As early as the beginning of this century, when protests against the World Trade Organization emerged around the world, a senior researcher at ANBOUND predicted that an era of fragmented global space had arrived. The world would become increasingly regionalized, the United States would move toward isolationism, and geopolitical crises would arise globally. Unfortunately, such predictions have now become a reality. The U.S.-China trade war in 2018, the global lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022, the Israel-Hamas conflict in 2023, and Donald Trump's second term leading the U.S. toward isolationism are all clear examples of this. Multinational companies that are accustomed to the benefits of globalization are the ones that struggle to adapt to the changes in the world order. In the past, multinational companies centered around 'profit', aiming for profit maximization and engaging in production and layout on a global scale. This was also the core idea of mainstream economic and supply chain theories. For example, Canadian economist Stephen Hymer and his American mentor Charles P. Kindleberger believed that multinational companies could leverage their monopolistic advantages in advanced technologies, industrial organization, and other areas to earn excess profits through direct foreign investment. Whenever the production costs in a particular place or region were lower, these multinational companies were highly motivated to set up industries and production there. Following this theory, during the peak of globalization, multinational companies made huge profits. Particularly, the period from the end of the Cold War in the 1990s to the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 is often referred to by some scholars as the 'golden age' of multinational corporations and supply chains. In less than two decades, political barriers between nations were eliminated, and political barriers were dismantled, paving the way for markets to play a decisive role in global industrial and supply chains. The result was the combination of low-cost labor from developing economies with abundant capital from developed economies, leading to production, with products easily crossing borders multiple times. From a business perspective, this meant that multinational companies could allocate resources globally based on economic costs. However, times have changed, and the world today is vastly different, now heavily constrained by factors such as geopolitics. Multinational companies, in their pursuit of extreme cost-efficiency and profit, are now facing attacks. Take the Red Sea crisis, which stemmed from the Israel-Hamas conflict, as an example. According to The New York Times, many companies are facing difficult decisions: If shipping companies want their vessels to use the Red Sea route, they risk being attacked by Houthi militants from Yemen and must pay significantly higher insurance fees. Alternatively, they could take a detour around Africa, adding over 6,400 km to their journey, which would increase travel time by 10 days and consume more fuel. Both options are less than ideal and raise costs, which will ultimately likely be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Therefore, multinational companies have started to realize that the traditional production and supply chain theories are outdated and need to be adjusted. Even professors from business schools, who have long been secluded in their ivory towers, admit that de-globalization has dismantled the classic textbooks used in classrooms. Companies need to change their models to adapt to the new global economic situation, and multinational production has evolved from a purely corporate behavior to a spatial production behavior constrained by complex spatial factors. In this process, geopolitical costs within transaction costs have risen significantly, and changes in costs due to spatial conflicts and contradictions have made geopolitics a risk factor that needs constant adjustment. Geopolitics now drives and even determines changes in overall costs. If companies only consider 'profits' without focusing on 'resilience', then in today's era of de-globalization, multinational corporations not only fail to make profits, but also cannot ensure their sustainable operation. Based on tracking research and analysis of the de-globalization trend, researchers at ANBOUND believe that there will be three significant changes in supply chains: First, supply chains will be shortened. In the new geopolitical and geo-economic environment, long supply chains represent uncertainty and high risk, making security and stability a higher priority than cost. Consequently, shortening supply chains has become a key trend in supply chain restructuring. Second, supply chains will place greater emphasis on regionalization. As supply chains face disruptions, distance from customers and markets introduces new risks, with companies potentially losing orders due to rising uncertainties. In response, global supply chains will likely be regionalized, forming multiple, distributed regional supply chain systems that cater to local market demands. Third, supply chains may become more selective. What was once a straightforward business model is now heavily influenced by geopolitical factors, including national security, alliances, ideology, values, and human rights. As a result, we are likely to see the emergence of selective supply chains in the future, where such factors shape global industry networks. In fact, since the Obama administration began promoting 'nearshoring' and 'friendshoring', some multinational companies have already been taking steps towards 'shortening' and 'regionalizing' their production layouts. This shift is also closely tied to the United States' desire to reduce its dependence on China. Mark Green, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Civilian Security, Migration, and International Economic Policy, once proposed the 'Western Hemisphere Nearshoring Act'. Green claimed that the bill would achieve three goals at once: reducing America's reliance on Chinese manufacturing, creating more jobs and economic growth opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and alleviating the immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border by reducing the number of illegal immigrants. Most importantly, this initiative would provide the United States with an effective path to counter China's growing influence in LAC. As for 'friendshoring', it is designed to achieve the aforementioned objectives. The term 'friend' refers to countries that share similar values with the U.S., including traditional allies. In this way, multinational companies have more options: they can establish supply chains in LAC or set up production in European countries like Denmark and Sweden, which are closer to the U.S. East Coast. Some viewpoints suggest that, despite the U.S. vigorously promoting 'friendshoring', Chinese capital still plays a crucial role. In early September 2023, at the annual meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, research presented by experts showed that despite changes in global trade patterns, the U.S. supply chain remains heavily dependent on China, albeit in a less direct manner. The dependence on Chinese supply chains has shifted from being overt to covert, but the path to fully breaking this dependency remains difficult. As a result, some commentators argue that whether it is 'decoupling' or 'de-risking', and whether outsourcing is 'nearshore' or 'friendshore', the U.S. and the West will not be able to truly break free from their reliance on Chinese supply chains, hence that this policy is unlikely to have a fundamentally 'negative impact' on China. However, a senior researcher at ANBOUND stated that the process of de-globalization will be very long and complex, and the adjustments in industrial chains, as a manifestation of this fundamental trend, will not follow a simple, linear path. It is crucial to summarize and analyze the stage-specific characteristics. Regarding the current wave of industrial chain adjustments, the most effective way to summarize its phase characteristics is not simply 'nearshoring' nor just 'friendshoring', but rather 'close produce', which combines certain aspects of both and presents a highly diversified form, a concept introduced by ANBOUND in August 2022. It serves as a macro tool for understanding and analyzing the adjustments in industrial chains within the de-globalization process. II. The Basic Theory and Core Principles of 'Close Produce' 'Close produce' refers to the deployment of major component industries around central markets and centers of productivity, forming a production system that is as closely integrated as possible. The term 'close' here has two aspects, namely spatial and social-environmental. It means that companies should choose to deploy and organize production in regions with minimal conflict and contradictions. While multinational companies in the past prioritized 'profit', under the 'close produce' theory, businesses must now strategically organize around three core factors: technology, capital, and consumption, all with the goal of reducing overall production and operational costs. (1) Technology as the core to reduce monopoly costs: As global competition intensifies, advanced technology plays a crucial role in leading the way and enhancing the comprehensive strength of multinational companies. On one hand, it helps businesses improve production processes and equipment, increasing production efficiency; on the other hand, it enhances product design, improving product quality and added value. However, the current global level of technological monopolies continues to rise, hindering the multinational flow and global sharing of advanced technologies. According to data analysis from 2004 to 2017, Associate Professor Lu Bing of the Beijing Normal University and his collaborators found that, compared to other products, high-tech products are more concentrated in certain countries, exhibiting higher levels of monopoly. This concentration has shown a self-reinforcing trend in recent years. For example, even in the past common bicycle production, there is a monopoly on gear mechanisms, with just two companies controlling the market. In semiconductor production, apart from the absolute monopoly of high-end photolithography machines, there are also numerous technological monopolies, such as photolithography resist chemicals, which are mainly monopolized by two companies from the U.S. and Japan. Therefore, multinational companies need to organize around the core of technology, focusing not only on their own technological research and innovation but also on strengthening cooperation with countries that possess advanced technologies. The goal is to narrow the gap with technological hubs as much as possible, maximize sustained technological leadership, and reduce monopoly costs. (2) Laying out surrounding the core of capital to reduce financing costs: This not only allows for broader financing channels, including stock issuance, bond issuance, etc., but also access to more financial support, thereby beneficial for global business expansion, research and innovation, and other strategic investments. However, in recent years, the global capital allocation pattern has become rather different due to dramatic changes in global conditions. Data shows that as of February 2025, the stock market capitalization rankings of various countries and regions are as follows: the United States with USD 60 trillion, ranked first; China with USD 10 trillion; Japan with USD 6.5 trillion; Hong Kong with USD 5.4 trillion; India with USD 4.5 trillion; the UK with USD 3.2 trillion; Canada with USD 3.2 trillion; Germany with USD 2.5 trillion; Australia with USD 1.6 trillion; and South Korea with USD 1.6 trillion. At the same time, the overall scale of global capital flows has shrunk. From 2022 to 2023, global capital inflows, compared to 2017 to 2019, dropped from 5.8% of global GDP to 4.4%, or from USD 4.5 trillion to USD 4.2 trillion. The trend of capital outflows follows the same pattern. In addition, the allocation structure of global capital has also undergone dynamic changes. From 2022 to 2023, the U.S. attracted 41% of global capital inflows, while its outflow share rose from 14% to 21%. China's capital flow decreased significantly, and the capital flows of financial centers also dropped sharply. Therefore, in the future, multinational enterprises will need to take various measures for industrial layout based on the new trend of global capital allocation, shortening the distance to the capital core and reducing financing costs. (3) Laying around the core of consumption to reduce logistics costs: This can make product sales more effective. Since products can reach consumers more quickly, it reduces distribution costs and time. On the other hand, it helps companies better grasp market dynamics, understand changes in consumer demand, and technological shifts, enabling the adjustment of production and marketing strategies when needed. However, more critically, this can significantly reduce the enormous costs of transportation and storage. During the era of globalization, global shipping costs continue to rise due to increasingly expensive human resources, threats from wars and conflicts, and rising port and canal tolls. The impact of geographical distance on costs has never been as significant as it is today. On February 6, Maersk released its 2024 financial report, reporting a revenue of USD 55.48 billion, an 8.65% year-on-year increase, and a net profit of USD 6.23 billion, up 59.47% compared to the previous year. It is worth noting that even though the Red Sea crisis is easing due to changes in the situation between Israel and Hamas, Maersk and other container shipping giants remain cautious about returning to the Red Sea. Many European shippers still refuse to ship goods via the Red Sea due to security concerns. Therefore, the layout around the core of consumption has become an inevitable choice for multinational enterprises for safety and stability reasons. In addition, 'close produce' has four other conditions: (1) Ideological emphasis on the same type of people; (2) Market space emphasis on consistency; (3) Logistics costs being relatively low; (4) Proportion of production costs in total costs being reduced. Considering the first condition, in recent years, as a set of values and ideas, ideology has gradually gained prominence worldwide. As it stands, ideology is manifested in the rise of nationalist thoughts, driving a broader politicization, securitization, and ethnification, becoming an objective fact that all countries and companies must pay attention to. Nationalism emphasizes the protection of national and ethnic interests and seeks equal economic rights and independent development. Economic nationalism is reflected in economics characterized by trade disputes and regional economies, and cultural nationalism is characterized by the protection and revival of national or local cultures. Meanwhile, political nationalism, marked by national division and ethnic opposition, is also on the rise, further strengthening economic and cultural nationalism. The experiences of Chinese companies in India serve as a clear example of this. A well-known Chinese mobile phone brand was forced to negotiate with a local Indian company to sell the majority of its shares and form a joint venture to comply with India's 'government requirements'. In 2023, India's law enforcement agencies arrested several senior executives of the Chinese mobile company's local office on charges of 'money laundering', including the temporary CEO and CFO. Such experiences mean that the global industrial layout in the future will largely have to be based on ideology, or else various uncertainties and risks will arise. Taking the U.S. as another example, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath pointed out that in recent years, geopolitical risks have risen, and the free flow of capital and goods is facing increasing threats. Geopolitics has widened trade rifts between groups. It has also caused the fragmentation of global supply chains, which in turn affects global trade and investment activities. According to WTO statistics, in the first half of 2023, the share of intermediate goods trade in global trade, which serves as an indicator of global supply chain activities, was 48.5%, 2.5 percentage points lower than the average of the previous three years. According to UN polling results also indicate that the proportion of parts trade between the U.S. and countries with similar political views fell to 73% in 2020, but this figure rose to 74% in 2022 and reached 77% in 2023. The WTO warns that signs of global supply chain fragmentation have begun to appear and will continue to pose a threat to global trade. Looking at the second condition, the market order and value principles followed by both parties are similar or the same, especially in terms of law and finance. In recent years, due to differences in market and value principles, legal risks for enterprises have become increasingly common. These risks mainly fall into four categories: (1) Market access risks, including tariff barriers, environmental standards, and the like; (2) Tax compliance risks, involving tax disputes and penalties; (3) Intellectual property management compliance risks, including accusations or lawsuits related to intellectual property infringement; (4) Human resources compliance risks, including labor contract disputes and project management issues. To provide an example, according to data cited in the Blue Book on Overseas Rights Protection of Chinese Enterprises (2023-2024), U.S. regulatory authorities have detained 9,791 batches of goods, with a value of approximately USD 35.6 billion, including electronic products, textiles, footwear, clothing, and industrial and manufacturing raw materials. It should be noted that countries around the world are at different stages of economic development, resulting in different legal systems and financial environments. Among them, the First World, primarily developed countries, has already established relatively complete legal systems and formed relatively open financial environments. The Second World, mainly developing countries, has established numerous legal systems but with more government control. The Third World is advancing industrial internationalization processes, with fewer legal and financial restrictions. The Fourth World, on the other hand, is relatively least developed in terms of legal and financial environments. Therefore, in the future, multinational enterprises will tend to choose countries or regions with market principles and orders that are similar to their own in order to reduce various risks, whether visible or hidden, in their production and operations. This will, in turn, create the basic conditions for a common market when globalization rises again. From the perspective of the third condition, based on the aforementioned factors, multinational companies may choose locations as close as possible to significantly reduce logistics costs. In recent years, with changes in the global economic situation, international logistics costs have experienced dramatic fluctuations, even showing a continuous upward trend. This is mainly due to increasingly expensive labor resources, threats of war and conflict, as well as various fees such as port and canal passage fees, ship maintenance fees, cargo insurance fees, and fuel costs. The impact of spatial distance on costs is becoming more and more significant. Therefore, multinational companies are bound to lean towards selecting countries or regions that are as close as possible. The United States promotes 'nearshoring', encouraging manufacturing to concentrate in North America through agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Inflation Reduction Act. Mexico benefits from these policy advantages and has seized development opportunities. Domestic manufacturing continues to experience high growth, with exports significantly increasing and becoming the largest source of goods imports for the United States. From 2021 to 2023, Mexico's foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow grew at an average rate of 8.6%, mainly flowing into sectors benefiting from the global industrial chain restructuring, such as transportation equipment, metals, computer equipment, and chemicals. In 2023, the share of FDI inflow into manufacturing industries was 41%, 13%, 9%, and 8%, respectively.' Looking at the fourth condition, production costs are placed last because smart factories are becoming increasingly common, which has led to a significant decrease in the proportion of labor costs in the total cost of finished products. In the past, one of the main considerations for developed countries to transfer industries to underdeveloped or developing countries was the cheap labor costs. However, as these underdeveloped and developing countries' economies have grown, their labor costs have risen year by year, significantly narrowing the gap with the labor costs in developed countries. Data shows that labor costs in China have now risen to about three times those of countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and India. At the same time, labor costs in Southeast Asia have also been rising. Since last year, countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia have all raised their minimum wage standards. Starting in July of last year, Vietnam's national minimum wage increased by an average of 6%. In major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, workers can now earn a minimum wage of VND 4.96 million (about USD 190) per month, an 80% increase compared to 10 years ago. Vietnam has set minimum wages in four regions, with wages in large cities being over 40% higher than in the least developed areas. Thailand plans to raise the minimum wage to THB 400 baht (about USD 11) per day, which is about a 14% increase from the current 300-350 baht. This new minimum wage means workers' monthly salary will be at least around USD 230. The Philippines has raised the minimum wage in the Greater Manila area since last summer, from PHP 610 (about USD 10.5) to PHP 645, a 6% increase, with a monthly salary of around USD 240. Malaysia already raised its minimum monthly wage from MYR 1,200 (about USD 254) to MYR 1,500 (about USD 340) in 2022, a 25% increase. It should be noted that while some analysts in these countries view wage increases positively, multinational companies may hesitate to establish operations locally in order to save costs. For example, business communities in Vietnam have indicated that due to concerns about rising labor costs, more and more companies are considering moving to areas outside the major cities, leading to instability in business development. At the same time, with the rapid development of modern internet technology and artificial intelligence, smart factories are becoming increasingly common. Traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany and the U.S. have made many explorations and practical attempts based on the concept of smart factories. China, along with other global industrial manufacturing giants, has also strongly promoted this development, introducing various digital development plans and documents. This has greatly facilitated the expansion of the scale and scope of global smart factories, further reducing the demand for labor. In the context of de-globalization, close produce represents a global production and supply chain layout and organization model that is different from the profit-centered approach of the past. Multinational companies will make remarkable reorganizations and realignments in the global market. This will be a significant structural adjustment and is likely to be accompanied by technological advancements, such as the establishment of more intelligent, labor-saving super factories. This adjustment is inevitable and may induce responses from the capital markets. Therefore, as a trend that has already occurred, it is crucial to pay attention to it and take prompt action. III. The Impact and Lessons of Close Produce to China The global supply chain restructuring and the increasing adoption of the close produce model by multinational companies are actually not beneficial to China's development. This can be viewed from two aspects. The first is from the perspective of multinational companies. This is a voluntary adjustment on their part, driven by an internal motivation to distance themselves from the Chinese market, which can even be seen as a form of 'decoupling' from another angle. For example, a number of foreign automotive companies are withdrawing from China. While many believe this is due to geopolitical factors, it is also the result of the 'close produce' reason. These companies no longer need to 'exchange market access for technology' familiar to China. Instead, they are reorganizing their production methods around new production hubs. The results of foreign companies adopting the close produce model are already evident. Taking the U.S.-China relationship as an example, China has long been the largest source of imports for the U.S., but this situation has changed. Data from 2024 shows that Mexico has surpassed China for the first time in 20 years, becoming the largest official source of imports for the U.S. In 2023, the U.S. trade deficit with China significantly narrowed, with imports from China dropping by 20% to USD 427.2 billion. While U.S. consumers and businesses have shifted to purchasing auto parts, shoes, toys, and raw materials from Mexico, Europe, South Korea, India, Canada, and Vietnam, a closer examination of trade relations among the U.S., China, Canada, and Mexico reveals an inverse correlation. As the U.S.-China trade relationship declines, trade between Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. is rising. This has effectively created a large 'close produce' zone, effectively creating the world's largest industrial park that can evade geopolitical influences, making it a haven for manufacturing. Despite tariff pressure being applied to Mexico and Canada following Trump's second term, it is clear that, as neighboring countries, these three nations will increasingly integrate their supply chains and production layouts in the future, leaving little to no opportunities or space for China. It has almost been a month since Trump took office as the President of the United States. Amid the intensifying competition between the U.S. and China, researchers at ANBOUND have found that multinational companies that have yet to adopt the 'close produce' model are now considering or accelerating the implementation of this strategy. According to a survey released by the Conference Board earlier this year, by the end of 2024, 85% of global business executives plan to make significant reforms to their supply chains, a 15-percentage-point increase from the previous year, and significantly higher than the levels at the beginning of the pandemic. The survey also shows that 45% of global CEOs believe trade wars represent the biggest geopolitical risk in 2025, a figure that is double that of the previous year. Among them, U.S. executives stand out with 47% listing trade wars as their biggest challenge. Dana Peterson, the Conference Board's chief economist, noted that 'there were a lot of executives, particularly CEOs, focused on changing their supply chains . . . it's returned to the top of the agenda'. The survey by the Conference Board found that executives from Southeast Asian companies are the most concerned about supply chain risks, with 90% of them planning to implement changes. In addition, 34% of business executives plan to use artificial intelligence to optimize supply chain performance and tracking capabilities, while also strengthening supply chain diversification. Recently, Taiwan's regional organization on economic development announced that it has launched several countermeasures and through the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), it will actively assist companies in adjusting their supply chain and investment strategies to ensure stable development. The organization stated that it will offer customized services to Taiwanese businesses looking to reorganize their operations overseas. For Taiwanese companies considering relocating their factories to the U.S. or shifting part of their production processes to Southeast Asia, India, and other countries, the organization will provide relevant information and insights into target markets, including potential states for U.S. investment, local investment laws, market opportunities, and assistance in finding business partners. For those deciding to convert part of their production capacity to supply local markets, it will provide information on local laws and help find potential partners. It will also establish task force teams at its overseas units in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, working with the main office to provide consultation and immediate services to affected businesses. Additionally, it will set up a direct service hotline. Furthermore, it plans to establish a 'Taiwan Investment and Trade Center' in the U.S. to assist Taiwanese businesses in evaluating the investment environment in U.S. states, supply chain relocation options, and local partner networks. It is understood that many Taiwanese businesses are also producing AI servers or related components in Mexico to be closer to the U.S. market. Some sources report that two Taiwanese companies are planning to move their production lines out of Mainland China. This highlights the need for China to pay close attention to the risks previously warned by ANBOUND's researchers, that Mainland China may not be part of the new global structure in the restructured globalization. This is, to some extent, caused by 'close produce'. The second aspect is viewed from the perspective of Chinese companies' overseas operations. 'Close produce' is also a supply chain model highly favored by many Chinese companies expanding abroad. To some extent, policymakers also encourage businesses to adopt this approach. A report from Bloomberg in September last year cited sources revealing that the Chinese government strongly advised the country's automakers to ensure that advanced electric vehicle (EV) technologies remain in China to prevent competitive pressure on the Chinese automotive industry after the loss of the industrial chain. The report stated that relevant departments encouraged these automakers to export component assembly kits to their foreign factories, meaning that key automobile parts would be produced in China and then sent to target markets for final assembly. Chinese automakers were also told not to invest in EV-related projects in India, to protect proprietary technology in China's EV industry and reduce regulatory risks. Furthermore, manufacturers wishing to invest in Turkey were instructed to first notify the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which oversees the EV industry, and relevant foreign affairs departments. In fact, Chinese EV companies, from BYD to Chery, are finalizing plans to build factories in countries such as Spain, Thailand, and Hungary. It is reported that neither the relevant authorities nor the car companies have responded to requests for comment. Bloomberg's analysis, however, believes that this will have a significant impact on the global transfer of automotive manufacturing technologies, especially presenting major obstacles for emerging countries like India. Bloomberg's report perfectly illustrates the two key features of the 'close produce' model: First, in this model, the production of key components is crucial, and these components will be organized in a systematic way; second, 'close produce' means that businesses should choose to deploy and organize production in areas with minimal conflict and contradictions. BYD can be considered one of the most representative enterprises in China practicing 'close produce' models. On July 9, 2024, the Turkish government announced that BYD plans to invest USD 1 billion in building a factory in Turkey with an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles, set to start production in 2026. Data summarized from relevant research indicates that, as of last July, BYD's overseas layout and production capacity plans include 150,000 units in Thailand, 300,000 units in Uzbekistan, 150,000 units in Brazil, about 150,000 units in Hungary, 150,000 units in Turkey, with operations spread across Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Central America, South America, Central Europe, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe. These factory-building plans highlight BYD's overseas expansion strategy and indirectly reflect its pursuit of a 'resilient' supply chain. Analyses show that, for example, BYD's strategy in Asia focuses on countries with relatively stable domestic politics and strong automotive industry ecosystems. Among Southeast Asian countries, Thailand, in particular, has experience as Toyota's industrial base in the region, with a well-established industry chain. The Uzbekistan factory not only supplies the local market but also covers Central Asia and, with the Belt and Road railway, it also supplies the Russian market to the north and Iran and other Arab regions to the south. The company currently has no plan to set up factories in Japan and South Korea in East Asia, nor is there a need for them, as Chinese production capacity can cover these regions. This way, its layout in Asia is relatively complete. Though some regions have slightly insufficient capacity, this can be addressed by expanding production. Regarding its market in the Americas, in February 2024, there were reports that BYD was considering building a factory in Mexico. The Wall Street Journal analyzed that such plans indicate that, despite the risks, the enthusiasm within China's automotive industry for expanding into North America is rising. Manufacturing cars in Mexico for the U.S. market would allow automakers to avoid the hefty import tariffs they would face when directly shipping cars from China to the U.S. At the time, BYD stated that the company had no urgent matters regarding new markets to announce. However, by mid-2024, BYD confirmed that it had identified potential factory locations in Mexico and was close to finalizing its decision. Yet, the resurgence of Trump in the presidential race significantly disrupted BYD's plans. Since the second half of 2024, reports have indicated that BYD has abandoned its search for a factory site in Mexico. Although BYD issued a statement saying it had not delayed its decision to build a factory in Mexico, it seems the company's 'Mexico plan' has effectively been put on hold. At the same time, in an effort to align with the new U.S. administration, Mexico has introduced a series of policies aimed at blocking Chinese companies, including BYD, from entering the local market. These policies target not only Chinese automakers but other industries as well. Since 2024, Mexico has imposed tariffs on Chinese steel and low-priced clothing. At the end of last year, Mexico even 'raided' markets where Chinese vendors gathered to sell goods. The newly-elected Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has promised a series of measures to support local manufacturing. It is foreseeable that Mexico will introduce more protectionist policies regarding Chinese and other Asian products. In other words, the path of 'close produce' for Chinese companies in Mexico is facing significant obstacles due to the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. This unfavorable trend for China is likely to manifest in other parts of the world as well. IV. Conclusion 'Close produce' is a new theory and concept for multinational corporations, with a wide-reaching impact. Today's multinational companies no longer only pursue 'profits'; 'resilience' is equally important. Specifically, in the context of de-globalization, the organizational methods and strategic directions of multinational corporations' global layouts focus on systematically addressing three core areas: technology, capital, and consumption, so as to reduce overall production and operational costs. With the deepening of geopolitical tensions and advancements in technology, structural adjustments in multinational companies are inevitable, and these changes will be reflected in the capital markets. When it comes to China's development, on one hand, the withdrawal of multinational companies and global adjustments may weaken China's position in the restructuring of globalization in the future. On the other hand, the process of Chinese companies implementing 'close produce' will be influenced by factors such as U.S.-China geopolitical pressure. As this trend has already emerged, for China, it would be crucial to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions and countermeasures. ______________ Zhijiang Zhao is a Research Fellow for Geopolitical Strategy programme at ANBOUND, an independent think tank.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZuoS0YcuoUPp	2025-02-15T16:43:56-08:00	
India’s AI-Driven Army: Smart Tech, Smarter Warfare – Analysis	India’s AI-powered military transformation is redefining modern warfare, reshaping defence operations, and redefining how battles are fought. In recent years, the Indian military has embarked on a transformative journey by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its operational framework. This technological evolution is reshaping modern warfare, particularly along sensitive borders with China and Pakistan, where enhanced surveillance and rapid threat assessment are paramount. AI is not merely an add-on but a force multiplier that improves situational awareness, decision-making, and operational efficiency across a variety of domains. The integration of AI into the military framework has been multifaceted, spanning surveillance, ground operations, cyber defense, and information warfare. The Indian Army now employs AI-powered surveillance drones, autonomous ground vehicles, cyber defense algorithms, and sophisticated battlefield analytics to enhance operational readiness. This technological infusion is not merely about improving efficiency; it represents a paradigm shift in defense strategy. In an era where algorithms, automation, and information warfare are as critical as traditional firepower, real-time situational awareness becomes indispensable, particularly along India’s volatile borders with China and Pakistan. The Line of Actual Control, a longstanding flashpoint with China that has witnessed heightened tensions since the 2020 Galwan clash, now serves as a testing ground for these innovative defense systems. Advanced machine-learning vision systems onboard autonomous surveillance drones now patrol the rugged, high-altitude terrains, detecting unauthorized incursions with unprecedented precision. This shift from a reactive to a predictive defense posture is transforming military operations. A senior Army official encapsulated the change by noting that AI is enabling forces to pre-empt threats before they escalate. This proactive approach is bolstered by multi-sensor data fusion technology, which consolidates satellite imagery, ground sensor data, and AI-driven analytics into a real-time digital map of potential threats. By merging diverse data streams into a single, coherent operational picture, commanders can make rapid, informed decisions under pressure, significantly enhancing field effectiveness. Artificial intelligence also plays a critical role in securing cyberspace and countering information warfare. Cyberattacks on military networks have become more frequent and sophisticated, with adversaries using state-sponsored hackers, espionage groups, and even AI-generated deepfakes to breach security. In response, India has deployed AI-enhanced cyber defense systems capable of identifying and neutralizing such threats in real time. Central to this digital transformation is the Situational Awareness Module for the Army (SAMA). Developed in collaboration with the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics, SAMA integrates inputs from the Army’s Command and Control Communication System, battlefield surveillance systems, and electronic situational reports to offer a unified, real-time decision-support tool for commanders. This comprehensive integration not only consolidates diverse information sources but also provides a strategic advantage in identifying and countering emerging threats. At the same time, the use of AI in disinformation warfare has led to military planners adapt. Adversaries now deploy AI-generated deepfakes and bot-driven propaganda to manipulate narratives and destabilize security. In response, the Indian Army is developing counter-disinformation measures designed to detect, trace, and neutralize deceptive efforts before they can influence decision-making or compromise public trust. The evolving battlefield now encompasses both physical and digital domains, compelling defense strategists to adopt a multifaceted approach that blends technological innovation with human expertise. Despite these significant advancements, challenges remain. One of the foremost concerns is the reliability of data used to train AI systems. Incomplete or biased datasets can result in misidentifications or erroneous threat assessments, potentially jeopardizing mission outcomes. Ethical debates surrounding autonomous weaponry also persist. Although the Indian Army has embraced AI-driven targeting and analytics, it maintains a strict 'human-in-the-loop' policy for lethal decisions, ensuring that critical judgments remain in the hands of experienced commanders. This commitment to human oversight reinforces the belief that while AI can enhance operational capabilities, it must not replace the instinct and judgment developed through years of field experience. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities further compound these challenges, as adversaries continuously seek ways to manipulate or corrupt AI models through sophisticated cyber techniques. In parallel with these technological strides, India is actively nurturing innovation through initiatives such as iDEX (Innovations for Defence Excellence). This government-backed program fosters collaboration among the military, startups, and academic institutions, driving rapid advancements in AI and other cutting-edge technologies. The momentum behind this collaborative approach was recently showcased at the AIDef Symposium 2024, where the Indian Army presented 75 AI-powered defense products. This event highlighted the rapid adoption of AI in decision-making, automation, and battlefield analysis, highlighting the nation’s commitment to integrating advanced technology into its defense architecture. Furthermore, the Military College of Telecommunication Engineering in Mhow has been designated as the Army’s AI Center of Excellence, further cementing India’s leadership in research areas such as autonomous warfare, cognitive electronic warfare, and AI-enhanced logistics. Looking to the future, India’s strategic deployment of AI is set to expand into new dimensions. The evolution of AI-powered Unmanned Ground Vehicles promises to introduce autonomous systems capable of patrolling conflict zones, identifying threats, and neutralizing hostile elements with minimal human intervention. Additionally, the application of predictive AI for strategic planning is poised to revolutionize military strategy by analyzing historical conflict data, enemy movements, and geopolitical trends to inform real-time operational decisions. While these technological advancements are profound, military officials should remain mindful of the enduring importance of human judgment. No algorithm can fully replace the instinct and experience honed through years of rigorous training and real-world engagement. Instead, the integration of AI serves as a force multiplier, enhancing capabilities and providing a critical edge on the modern battlefield while ensuring that human oversight remains at the core of strategic decision-making. This balanced approach, which fuses advanced technology with seasoned expertise, is key to navigating the complex and dynamic challenges of contemporary warfare. India’s AI-powered military revolution is reshaping the nation’s defense strategy by merging state-of-the-art technology with traditional combat doctrines. The comprehensive adoption of AI from advanced surveillance and multi-sensor data fusion to robust cyber defense and strategic predictive analytics is creating a dynamic and responsive battlefield environment. As India continues to embrace these innovations, it is poised to achieve a level of operational excellence that could redefine military supremacy in the Indo-Pacific region. Although challenges such as data bias, ethical concerns, and cybersecurity threats persist, the successful fusion of AI with human insight heralds a new era in military operations, one where rapid, informed decision-making and technological agility work in concert to secure national sovereignty in an increasingly complex global landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZu6mFSNniVz8	2025-02-15T16:41:39-08:00	
Banning Khmer Rouge Denialism Is A Bad Move For Cambodia And The ...	By David Hutt Quite soon, possibly to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover in April, Cambodia will pass a new law making it a jailable offense of up to five years to 'deny, trivialize, reject or dispute the authenticity of crimes' committed during that regime’s 1975-79 rule. The bill, requested – and presumably drafted – by Hun Sen, the former prime minister who handed power to his son in 2023, will replace a 2013 law that narrowly focused on denial. The bill’s seven articles haven’t been publicly released, so it remains unclear how some of the terms are to be defined. 'Trivialize' and 'dispute' are broad, and there are works by academics that might be seen as 'disputing' standard accounts of the Khmer Rouge era. Is the 'authentic history' of the bill’s title going to be based on the judgments of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia? If so, there will be major gaps in the narrative. Cambodia’s courts are now so supine that one presumes the 'authentic history' will be whatever the state prosecutor says it is, should a case come to trial. There are two concerns about this. First, the Cambodian government is not being honest about why it’s pushing through this law. There is some scholarly debate about the total number of deaths that occurred between 1975 and 1979, and estimates range from one to three million. There also remain discussions about how much intention there was behind the barbarism or how much the deaths were unintended consequences of economic policy and mismanagement. No nostalgia Yet, in Cambodian society, it’s nearly impossible to find a person these days who is worse off than they were in 1979, so there’s almost no nostalgia for the Khmer Rouge days, and the crude propaganda inflicted on people some fifty years ago has faded. There are no neo-Khmer Rouge parties. 'Socialism', let alone 'communism,' is no longer in the political vocabulary. Even though China is now Phnom Penh’s closest friend, there is no affection for Maoism and Mao among Cambodians. Moreover, as far as I can tell, the 2013 law that covers denialism specifically hasn’t needed to be used too often. Instead, the incoming law is quite obviously 'political', not least because since 1979, Cambodia’s politics has essentially been split into two over the meaning of events that year. For the ruling party – whose old guard, including Hun Sen, were once mid-ranking Khmer Rouge cadre but defected and joined the Vietnam-led 'liberation' – 1979 was Cambodia’s moment of salvation. For today’s beleaguered and exiled political opposition in Cambodia, the invasion by Hanoi was yet another curse, meaning the country is still waiting for true liberation, by which most people mean the downfall of the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) of Hun Sen and his family. The CPP is quite explicit: any opposition equates to supporting the Khmer Rouge. 'You hate Pol Pot but you oppose the ones who toppled him. What does this mean? It means you are an ally of the Pol Pot regime,' Hun Sen said a few years ago, with a logic that will inform the incoming law. Crackdown era The ruling CPP has finished its destructive march through the institutions that began in 2017 and is now marching through the people’s minds. A decade ago, Cambodia was a different sort of place. There was one-party rule, repression, and assassinations, yet the regime didn’t really care what most people thought as long as their outward actions were correct. Today, it’s possible to imagine the Hun family lying awake at night, quivering with rage that someone might be thinking about deviations from the party line. Now, the CPP really does care about banishing skepticism and enforcing obedience. What one thinks of the past is naturally an important part of this. Another troublesome factor is that, with Jan. 27 having been the 80th anniversary of Holocaust Remembrance Day, there is a flurry of interest globally in trying to comprehend how ordinary people could commit such horrors as the Holocaust or the Khmer Rouge’s genocide. The publication of Laurence Rees’ excellent new book, The Nazi Mind: Twelve Warnings from History, this month reminds us that if 'never again' means anything, it means understanding the mentality of those who supported or joined in mass executions. Yet we don’t learn this from the victims or ordinary people unassociated with the regime, even though these more accessible voices occupy the bulk of the literature. Listen only to the outsider, and one comes away with the impression that almost everyone living under a despotic regime is either a passive resister or an outright rebel. There are a few devotees who find redemption after realizing their own sins – as in the main character in Schindler’s List. Yet no dictatorship can possibly survive without some input from a majority of the population. Thus, it’s more important to learn not 'why they killed,' but 'why we killed' – or 'why we didn’t do anything.' Remembrance is vital The world could do with hearing much more about other atrocities, like Cambodia’s. For many in the West, there is a tendency to think of the Holocaust as a singular evil, which can lead one down the path of culture, not human nature, as an explanation. One lesson of the 1930s was that the people most able to stop the spread of Fascism were the same people least capable of understanding its impulses. The left-wing intelligentsia was content to keep to the position until quite late that Fascism was just a more reactionary form of capitalist exploitation, while conservative elites had a self-interest in thinking it was a tamable version of Marxism. Their materialism, their belief that life could be reduced to the money in your pocket and what you can buy with it, didn’t allow them to see the emotional draw of Fascism. These intense feelings brought the torch parade, the speeches, the marching paramilitaries, the uniforms and symbols, the book burnings, and the transgressiveness of petty revenge and bullying. Perhaps the best definition of Fascism came from Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, who said: 'there lives alongside the twentieth century the tenth or the thirteenth. A hundred million people use electricity and still believe in the magic power of signs and exorcisms.' Likewise, the same people now who were supposed to stop the rise of new despotisms have been as equally ignorant about the power of signs and exorcisms. Europe kidded itself that Russian strongman Vladimir Putin was as much a rationalist as Germany’s Angela Merkel. The notion that all the Chinese Communist Party cared about was economic growth blinded world leaders to its changing aspirations: Han supremacy, jingoism, revenging past humiliations, national rebirth and territorial conquests. In Cambodia, it is possible to find books by or about Khmer Rouge perpetrators, yet the curious reader must exert a good deal of effort. Those who do that find that a temperament for the transgressive and the cynical motivated the Khmer Rouge’s cadres. It won’t be long before the world marks a Holocaust Memorial Day without any survivors present at the commemorations. Cambodia’s horror is more recent history, yet anyone who was a teenager at the time is now in their sixties. We haven’t too long left with that generation. Even aside from the clear political reasons for introducing the new law, it might give historians pause before writing about the more gray aspects of the Khmer Rouge era – or exploring the motives of the perpetrators. Once it becomes illegal to 'condone' the Khmer Rouge’s crimes, whatever that means, revealing what one did as a cadre could skirt the border of criminality. My fear is that the law will confine history to the study of what the Khmer Rouge did, not why it did it. This would be much to the detriment of future generations worldwide.

Why DOGE Should Leave The Penny Alone – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen It’s been reported that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is looking at changing money forever. Musk’s plan? Kill the penny. Killing the penny is a popular idea, and it sounds like a no-brainer when you look at some of the details. After all, when was the last time you actually used a penny? For most people, it’s rare. Hardly anyone carries change anymore. It seems like pennies don’t have much upside. The downside of pennies also seems clear. According to the US Mint, producing one penny costs 2.72¢. In other words, the government loses money when it mints pennies. According to The Hill, 3.23 billion pennies were minted in 2024. Since 1.72¢ is lost per penny minted, that comes to a $56 million loss minting pennies. This seems like low-hanging fruit for a money-saving organization like DOGE. However, I think getting rid of the penny would be a mistake. Why would I defend the penny? Because I don’t want the government to get rid of cash. The last time the government stopped minting a coin was the half-penny in 1857. The US government and its officials aren’t used to halting production of coins, and the American public isn’t used to it either. If our politicians and bureaucrats start taking coins out of circulation, they’ll build up knowledge and experience about the process. Economists call investment knowledge and skills that help improve future productivity in doing a task human capital. I don’t want bureaucrats building human capital in removing coins from circulation because this same knowledge and experience could be used to remove cash more generally. After all, many of the arguments against the penny could apply to the nickel or dime. When was the last time you really needed a dime? And if you’re removing those, it may be time to consider doing away with change in general. You can see how this process could continue. Note, I’m not claiming that once you stop minting pennies, a cashless society becomes inevitable. It just becomes cheaper to go cashless once we build the capital necessary to do away with particular forms of cash. Some slopes are slippery. Some argue that a cashless society is inevitable and that it would be a good thing. You can already see society moving in that direction. In some cities, there are already restaurants that don’t accept cash payments. What percentage of your weekly transactions use cash? But why would a cashless society be a problem? The biggest issue is that it would be easier for Uncle Sam to invade our privacy. In a cashless world, every financial transaction you make is tied to your name. Any government agency with an ill-gotten warrant could scrutinize every payment you’ve made or received. The bigger fear is that the government may someday 'replace' cash in the form of government digital cash. The Trump administration has come out against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), but there’s no telling how future administrations will feel about it. In that case, the warrant point will be moot. The government will simply have access to every transaction you make outside of farmer’s market bartering. Ultimately, I’m not opposed to the idea of trying to minimize waste in minting pennies, either by slowing down production or making the underlying chemical formula even cheaper (something that has already happened in 1982). However, I prefer we hold off on taking 'useless' forms of cash out of our system. There’s no shortage of experts who think we could do without cash as a whole, and making it more difficult for them is more important than making the mint slightly more economical. Long live the penny. About the author: Peter Jacobsen is a Writing Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.

Is Our Five-Year Nightmare Finally Over? – OpEd	Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s confirmation as the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the US is the ultimate repudiation of the Covid policy response. The scheme of lockdown-until-vaccination was the biggest effort of government and industry on a global scale on historical record. It was all designed to transfer wealth to winning industries (pharma, online retail, streaming services, online education), divide and conquer the population, and consolidate power in the administrative state. By 2021, RFK, Jr., had emerged as the world’s most vocal, erudite, and knowledgeable critic of the scheme. In two brilliant books – The Real Anthony Fauci and The Wuhan Cover-Up – he documented the entire enterprise and dated the evolution of the pandemic industry from its postwar inception to the present. There was simply no way to read these books and think about the corporatist cabal in the same way. The circumstances that led to his appointment at HHS are themselves implausible and remarkable. Perceiving President Biden to be a weak candidate – one who had forced masks and shots on the population and brutally censored tech and media – he decided to make a run for president, presuming that there would be an open primary. There wasn’t one, so he was forced into an independent run. That effort was chewed up by the usual political dynamic that befalls every third-party effort – too many ballot-access barriers plus the usual logic of Duverger’s law. That left the campaign in a difficult spot. At the same time, two huge political shifts had become clear. The Democratic Party had become a vessel and a front mainly for the administrative state with a veneer of woke ideology, while the Republican Party was being taken over by refugees from the Democrats, in effect creating a new Trump party out of the remnants of the other two. The rest is legendary. Trump linked up with Elon Musk to do to the federal government what he did when he took over Twitter, taking the company private, gutting the place of embedded federal assets, and firing 4 out of 5 workers. In the midst of this, and faced with a terrifying flurry of legal attacks, Trump dodged an assassin’s bullet. That triggered terrible memories of RFK, Jr.’s father and uncle, and thus sparked discussions about coming together. Within a matter of weeks, we had a new coalition that brought together old antagonists, as many people and groups seemingly in the same instant realized their conjoined interests in cleaning up the corporatist cartel. With the newly freed platform of X to reach the public, MAGA/MAHA/DOGE was born. Trump won and chose RFK, Jr., to lead the most powerful public health agency in the world. The barrier was Senate confirmation, but that was achieved through some incredible triangulation that made it extremely difficult to vote no. In the big picture, you can measure the size of this titanic shift in American politics by the way the votes in the Senate lined up. All Republicans but one voted for the most prominent scion of the Democratic Party to head the health empire while all Democrats voted no. That alone is striking, and a testament to the power of the pharma lobby, which, during the hearings, was exposed as the hidden hand behind the most passionate opponents of the confirmation. Is our nightmare over? Not yet. Writing not even a month into the second presidential term of Donald Trump, it is still unclear just how much authority he truly exercises over the sprawling executive branch. For that matter, no one can even agree on how large this branch is: between 2.2 million and 3 million employees and somewhere between 400 and 450 agencies. The financial bleed in this realm is unthinkable and far worse than even the biggest cynic can imagine. Five former secretaries of the Treasury took to the pages of the New York Timeswith a shocking claim. 'The nation’s payment system has historically been operated by a very small group of nonpartisan career civil servants.' This has included a career employee called 'fiscal assistant secretary—a post that for the prior eight decades had been reserved exclusively for civil servants to ensure impartiality and public confidence in the handling and payment of federal funds.' There is no reason even to read between the lines. What this means is that no person voted into office by the people and no one appointed by such a person has access to the federal books since 1946. This is startling beyond belief. No owner of any company would ever tolerate being barred from the accounting offices and payment systems. And no company can offer any public stock without independent audits and open books. And yet almost 80 years have gone by during which time neither has been true for this gigantic enterprise called the federal government. That means that $193 trillion has been spent by an institution that has never faced granulated oversight from the people and never met the normal demands that every enterprise faces every day. The usual habit in Washington has been to treat every elected leader and their appointments as temporary and transitory marionettes, people who come and go and disturb little to nothing about the normal operations of government. This new administration seems to have every intention to change that but the job is inconceivably challenging. As much public support as MAGA/MAHA/DOGE enjoy for now, and as many people from those groups are getting embedded in the power structure, they are outnumbered and outmaneuvered by millions of agents of the old order. This transition will not be easy if it happens at all. The inertia of the old order is mighty. Even on the issue of health and pandemics, there is already confusion. CBS News has reported that Fauci-loyalist and mRNA pusher Gerald Parker will head the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response or OPPR. The report cited only unnamed 'health officials' and the appointment has been celebrated by Scott Gottlieb, the Pfizer board member who nudged Trump into backing lockdowns in 2020. All the while, this appointment has not been confirmed by the White House. We do not know if OPPR, created by Congressional charter, will even be funded. The reporter will not reveal his sources – raising the question of why any appointment having to do with health should be surrounded by such cloak-and-dagger machinations. If Dr. Parker becomes ensconced in this position and another health emergency is declared, this time for Bird flu, HHS and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., will not be in any kind of decision-making position at all. The larger problems have to do with a broader question: is the president really in charge of the executive branch? Can he hire and fire? Can he spend money or decline to spend money? Can he set policy for the agencies? One might suppose that the whole answer to these questions can be found in Article 2, Section 1: 'The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.' And yet that sentence was written almost 100 years before Congress created this thing called the 'civil service' that nowhere appears in the Constitution. This fourth branch has grown in size and power to swamp both the presidency and the legislature. Courts are going to have to sort this out, and already an avalanche of lawsuits has hit the new administration for daring to presume control over agencies and their activities of which the president is and must necessarily be held accountable. Lower federal courts seem to be demanding that the president be that in name only, while the Supreme Court might have a different opinion. The much-ballyhooed 'constitutional crisis' consists of nothing other than an attempt to reassert the original constitutional design of government. This is the background template in which RFK, Jr., takes power at HHS, and oversees all the sub-agencies. These agencies played a huge role in covering for the attack on liberty and rights over five years. His confirmation is a symbolic repudiation of the most egregious public policies on record. And yet, the repudiation is entirely implicit: there has been no commission, no admission of error, no one truly held responsible, and no real accountability. The trajectory on which we find ourselves affords many reasons for champagne celebrations, but sober up quickly. There is a very long way to go and enormous barriers in place to get us to the point that we are really safe again from the marauding corporatist/statist complex and their plots and schemes to rob the public of rights and liberties. In the meantime, to invoke a common phrase, keep these new appointees in your thoughts and prayers.

The Fed Has Stopped Pretending That Price Inflation Is Going Away...	By Ryan McMaken At its September 2024 meeting, the Fed’s FOMC cut the target federal funds rate by a historically large 50 basis points and then justified this cut on the grounds that 'The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.' The FOMC again cut the target rate in November and then again in December. Each time, the FOMC’s official statement said something to the effect of '[price] inflation is headed to two percent. Specifically, the November statement said '[Price inflation] has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective.' The December statement said exactly the same thing. It remains unclear what motivated the FOMC to slice the target rate so drastically in September. Was it a cynical political ploy to stimulate the economy right before an election? Or was the Fed spooked by weak economic data? We don’t know, and the Fed is a secretive organization. But whatever the Fed actually believes, the committee’s claims about 'greater confidence' in falling price inflation is now gone. The FOMC announced in January that it would not lower the target rate, and the FOMC also removed from its official statement the line about making progress 'toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective.' That sentence disappeared from the written statement, although Powell, in the press conference, apparently felt the need to remind the audience that 'Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal…' He nonetheless failed to mention anything about continued progress. It looks increasingly like all that confidence about 'sustainable progress' on price inflation back in September—in the heat of election season, of course—was just one of the Fed’s many bogus, politically motivated forecasts. Even if the Fed truly is motivated by the official data, though, it’s clear that the Fed now has good reason to downplay talk of declaring victory on the Fed’s two-percent inflation goal. Recent official data—which generally reflects the best scenario that government bean counters can muster—shows plenty of bad news in this area. According to the Fed’s preferred inflation measure—PCE inflation—year-over-year price inflation reached an eight-month high in December, at 2.6 percent. (December is the most recent available number on PCE.) If we look at January’s headline CPI inflation, released on Wednesday, the picture is even worse. Year-over-year CPI inflation hit a nine-month high in January, at 3.0 percent, and month-to-month growth was at an eighteen-month high of 0.5 percent. Thanks to the Fed’s unrestrained embrace of monetary inflation from 2020 to 2022, American consumers are still facing the grim reality of rising prices on basic necessities. In January’s CPI report, some of the largest jumps in prices were in food (2.5 percent), energy services (2.5 percent), other services (4.3 percent) and shelter (4.4 percent). Wholesale prices also suggested that we won’t be seeing much relief from price inflation. According to new producer price index numbers, released on Thursday, year-over-year growth in the PPI reached a 24-month high of 3.5 percent. This is bad news for those hoping that the Fed’s predictions of falling prices might somehow come true. CNN delivered the bad news on Thursday: 'The stronger numbers seen in Thursday’s PPI will tend to translate into continued consumer price inflation through the middle of the year.' So much for the Fed’s dog-and-pony show of late summer 2024 when Jerome Powell repeatedly assured the public that the economy was in great shape and that price inflation was rapidly disappearing. What the Fed Should Do So, what should the Fed’s FOMC do now? The answer: 'nothing.' Observers of Fed policy often speak in terms of the Fed 'setting' interest rates or 'raising' the target rate. In truth, the Fed doesn’t set rates, and it doesn’t raise interest rates, either. The Fed can allow interest rates to rise by intervening less in debt markets. If the Fed just backs off from its endless manipulations through its open market operations, the Fed won’t be buying assets with newly created money and directly driving more price inflation. After so many years of forcing down interest rates, if the Fed just took a break from its constant meddling, interest rates would naturally rise. That would lead to bankruptcies among zombie companies and other enterprises that can’t survive without a constant infusion of new, cheap money. On the other hand, the bubble economy would start to heal, prices would fall, and prospective first-time home buyers might have a chance of actually buying a home. Ordinary people who can’t afford hedge fund managers might be able to actually make some money on investments again as interest rates on ordinary investments rise to more normal levels. This is what the Fed should have been doing in September instead of manufacturing new excuses as to why it needed to cut rates again. Of course, the Fed never just sits back and lets the market function freely, because it is a political institution. It does what the regime asks of it, whether it’s for short-term stimulus, or when the federal government asks the Fed to push down interest rates to keep interest payments on the huge federal debt manageable. With Trump in office, it looks like there’s no break in the usual politicians’ calls for easy money. Indeed, it only took six weeks in office, and Donald Trump is back to demanding that the central bank force down interest rates. According to Bloomberg on Wednesday: 'President Donald Trump called for lower interest rates, seeking to raise pressure on the Federal Reserve as he moves to implement a second-term economic agenda high on tariffs and expanding tax breaks. ‘Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs,’ Trump said Wednesday in a post on social media.' Is this a tacit admission that tariffs are a tax and will therefore slow the economy? Is Trump admitting he needs more easy money to keep up the appearance of a growing economy? Whatever the thinking is, forcing down interest rates even further will not benefit ordinary people. They’ll just bring price inflation, malinvestment, and more of the same stagnation that that only looks like growth thanks to runaway government spending and record-breaking deficits.

As Cubans Flock To Russia’s War, Is Havana Playing Dumb? – Analys...	By Valeria Yehoshyna, Olya Ivleva, Kyrylo Ovsyaniy, Kira Tolstyakova and Schemes (RFE/RL) -- In a room far behind the front lines in central Ukraine, a Cuban man wearing Russian military fatigues smiles widely as he taps out a rhythm on a table. But his mood soon turns somber. Frank Dario Jarrosay Manfuga, 36, joined Russia's army in January 2024.By March he had been captured by Ukrainian forces, and he is now hoping for a way out of a desperate situation.'I never intended to kill anyone. I never wanted to participate in a war. I have a family,' said Manfuga, who claimed he was tricked into boarding a Russia-bound plane with the promise of a job in construction.'Maybe some organization could save me,' he said, adding he has no desire to return to Russia or Cuba.Manfuga's claim that he was duped could not be verified. A former geography teacher who later became a professional musician to increase his income, he is now a captured mercenary. His interview with Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was arranged through contacts in the Ukrainian military, which is keen to demonstrate just how wide the Russia has cast its net in a search for foreign manpower to bolster the invasion and offset an unpopular conscription drive at home. In Manfuga's case, that distance is more than 9,500 kilometers from Moscow. And he is not alone. 'Based on passports obtained by Ukrainian hackers, our own information from Cuba, numerous videos we've seen, and reports of some Cubans killed in combat, we can estimate that around 5,000 Cuban soldiers are fighting for Russia,' Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, co-founder of the Cuban Democratic Directorate, a U.S.-based NGO advocating for democratic change in communist Cuba, told Schemes. 'This network could not function without the Cuban regime's approval.' If that figure is accurate, it would amount to under half the number of soldiers from North Korea reportedly participating in Russia's war with their government's open backing -- most notably in the effort to counter Ukraine's shock offensive in Russia's Kursk region. But unlike North Koreans, Cuban fighters in Russia have left a significant social media footprint, with many openly embracing the Kremlin's militarism and ideology, a Schemes investigation found. Those posts helped Schemes identify hundreds of mercenaries, find previously unreported training facilities with the aid of satellite imagery, and discover the location and the nature of some of the Cubans' military activities in Russia and on Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. They also raise questions about how hard Cuba's pro-Russian government is 'working to neutralize and dismantle a human trafficking network,' as its Foreign Ministry claimed in September 2023, when evidence of Cubans fighting in the war was beginning to emerge. Dead In The Battle For Bakhmut Important indications of the scale of Cubans' involvement in the war came just days after the Cuban Foreign Ministry's statement, when a document hack unearthed nearly 200 Cubans serving in the Russian military, initially posted to the Tula region south of Moscow. That trove was first discovered by the Ukraine-focused investigative group InformNapalm, with the documents proving the Cubans' service coming from the e-mail account of a Russian major hacked by Cyber Resistance, a Ukrainian hacker group. Since then, RFE/RL journalists have found new evidence of hundreds of other apparent Cuban mercenaries on the Russian social network VKontakte. In many cases, their accounts were created in 2024 -- seemingly the year they arrived in Russia for pre-deployment training. The Schemes investigation tied many of the Cuban mercenaries with an online presence to the 106th Airborne Division. In one example, a photo posted in July 2023 by a man named Aliesky Anache included the geotag Promyshlenny Proyezd, an area of the city of Tula known to host the 106th Airborne Division and its 51st Parachute Regiment.Journalists were subsequently able to geolocate the blue-walled military building where that photo was taken. Satellite imagery of the region suggests there is no other military unit stationed anywhere in the surrounding area. Units of the 106th Airborne Division participated in the battle for Bakhmut. Known grimly as 'the meat grinder,' the monthslong battle concluded with the Russian occupation of the city in May 2023 and was the one of the bloodiest chapters of the war to date. And at least one Cuban, a 41-year-old fighter with the call sign Chiki, appears to have died there before being buried in Moscow, according to a post on VKontakte found by RFE/RL journalists. Another Cuban with the same call sign became a minor celebrity in Russia after appearing on the military TV channel Zvezda.In a segment of a Zvezda program on August 2, 2024, the fighter, whose real name is Rafael, was seen scrawling 'Hasta la vista, baby' ('Goodbye, baby' in Spanish) on military projectiles and informed the interviewer that he had 'fallen in love with buckwheat,' a Russian staple, during his military service.Rafael's VKontakte profile features photos of him wearing patches associated with Russia's Wagner Group.From August on, Rafael posted several images from combat positions in Ukraine's Kherson region. But many of his social media posts before then featured photos with other Cubans during training exercises and outings to bars in Tula. The bar photos and the fighters that featured in them helped RFE/RL journalists geolocate a second military facility used by the Cubans of the 106th. This previously unpublicized facility in the Tula region is the paratrooper training ground, unofficially called Krym (Crimea) in VKontakte geotags. Rush For Rubles, Assist For Russia Grueling poverty in Cuba helps explain the appeal of Russian military service to Cubans. Historically friendly ties with Moscow dating back to Soviet times mean that citizens of the island nation can enter the country as tourists without a visa. A typical monthly salary for a foreigner enlisting in the Russian army on a yearlong contract is the equivalent of $2,000. That was seemingly enough for Odin Rivas, who featured in one of Rafael's posts from Tula, to swap running a small business in Cuba for active military duty. Rivas has been posting frequently from military positions, promoting Russian and Soviet propaganda symbols. Back in 2022, he was being celebrated as a hero in the Cuban press after he volunteered as a firefighter to help extinguish a giant fire at the Matanzas oil terminal. Matanzas is at the heart of Moscow's patronly ties to Cuba, since it receives large oil deliveries from Russian tankers. Using the ship-tracking service Marine Traffic and satellite images from Planet Labs, RFE/RL journalists found satellite images showing that Russian oil tankers had docked in Cuban ports in 2022, 2023, and 2024. According to data obtained by Schemes from the KSE Institute and Kpler, in 2024, tankers transported more than 1.8 million barrels of Russian oil products to Cuba. From the beginning of 2025, they carried more than 700,000 barrels to the Caribbean island. One of those deliveries came at a vital time as Cuba witnessed its worst protests in several years in March 2024 amid energy and food shortages. Havana has never formally endorsed Russia's invasion. But on March 1, a day when Russia targeted civilian infrastructure and killed hundreds of civilians in cities across Ukraine, its Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Pedro Luis Pedroso Cuesta, criticized the West for 'assuming that Russia would remain defenseless in the face of direct threats to its national security.' And in May 2024, Russian state media reported Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel had wished Russian President Vladimir Putin success in 'the special military operation,' as the Kremlin calls the war, during talks in Moscow that coincided with Russia's May 9 military parade commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. In comments to Schemes, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Cuba 'has clearly chosen Russia's side in the full-scale war because of its anti-American stance.' In addition to extensive open-source research, Schemes journalists obtained copies of Russian military documents from Ukrainian military sources concerning other Cubans who are serving in Russian military units. One of the documents was a questionnaire belonging to Julio Pelaez, a 38-year-old man who last September appealed in Russian on VKontakte for help getting a plane ticket to Moscow in order to report to 'any recruitment center.' In the questionnaire, Pelaez, who said he had never been abroad before, appeared to lean into a Kremlin propaganda trope concerning Ukraine when stating his motivation to join the war. 'I consider it the duty of every free person who hates Nazis,' Pelaez wrote.By the end of October, according to his profile page, Pelaez was in Russia, and had posted a photo of his military gear complete with the pro-war 'Z' symbol, a patch featuring the Cuban flag, and a document resembling a Russian passport Valeria Yehoshyna is a journalist for Schemes (Skhemy), an investigative news project run by RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. Yehoshyna was recognized as one of the 'Top 30 Under 30' by the Kyiv Post in 2019 and has won a number of awards, including the top prizes at the V. Serhienko Investigative Journalism Competition in 2017 and the Mezhyhirya Festival in 2018.

Trump’s Ukraine Envoy: EU Won’t Be Part Of Peace Talks	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- US President Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, told Europeans on Saturday that their inclusion in talks to end the war in Ukraine was 'not going to happen'. Kellogg dropped the bombshell at the Munich Security Conference after Europeans for a week had scrambled to emphasise no Ukraine peace talks should happen without Kyiv or them. Asked whether Europeans should have a role in future talks, Kellogg said he was 'from the school of realism, and that is not going to happen'. The comments are the most explicit confirmation yet by a senior US administration official that they intend for Europe to follow the talks from the sidelines, beyond preparing any post-deal security guarantees for Ukraine. 'To my European friends, I would say: get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending,' Kellogg said. Kellogg is expected to soon embark on a tour to Ukraine and around all NATO countries to discuss the talks. Washington had also sent a request to European capitals to provide detailed proposals on the weaponry, peacekeeping troops and security arrangements they could provide to Ukraine as part of any security guarantees, the FT reported earlier on Saturday. Kellogg said the involvement of too many countries has wrecked the process in previous peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow – including those under the Minsk Format in which France and Germany were at the table. 'What we don't want to do is get into a large group discussion,' Kellogg said. Instead, he added, Trump's strategy was to have a deal in 'days and weeks' rather than a longer timeframe. Kellogg also said he sees Washington as an intermediary, not a Ukrainian ally or partner. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, had earlier this week confirmed to reporters he had spoken to Kellogg before the envoy’s anticipated Ukraine trip this month. No exact date has been announced yet. Kellogg’s upcoming visit is expected to 'provide comprehensive information on Russian aggression against our country,' Yermak said over Telegram, adding he had briefed Kellogg on the battlefield situation, the safety of Ukrainian civilians and meetings at the Munich Security Conference. After Trump’s election in November, Ukrainian officials had been racing to establish relations with the new administration fast, but things have dragged on. An initial trip that was announced to take place before Trump’s inauguration did not happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZi6vLuj96nsM	2025-02-15T16:15:59-08:00	
Mass Protest On Serbia’s Statehood Day; President Stages Counter-...	By Milica Stojanovic Tens of thousands of people blocked streets in the central Serbian city of Kragujevac on Saturday in support of ongoing student-led protests calling for official accountability for the Novi Sad railway station disaster that left 15 people dead in November. In the country’s north-west, meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic held a counter-rally in the city of Sremska Mitrovica as he struggled to regain control over the political agenda after three months of mass protests sparked by anger over perceived institutional corruption. One of the protesters in Kragujevac, Rajko Bozic from Novi Sad, told BIRN that there was an 'atmosphere of solidarity and optimism' in the streets of the city. Bozic said he travelled to Kragujevac for the rally because he thinks 'the students have finally led this society in the right direction and they are leading a strong, thoughtful and important struggle, and we are here to support them'. He described how local residents warmly welcomed the demonstrators and were 'making sure that no one is hungry, no one is cold' amid freezing temperatures in Serbia on Saturday. The protesters’ blockade of Kragujevac, named 'Sretnimo se na Sretenje' ('Let’s Meet on Sretenje') – a religious holiday as well as Serbia’s Statehood Day – started at 9am and was due to continue until seven minutes past midnight. Fifteen minutes of silence in the memory of the 15 Novi Sad victims were observed at 11.52am, the time the disaster happened, and were due to be observed again at 11.52pm. On Saturday morning, long columns of vehicles were seen headed for Kragujevac, Serbia’s fourth-largest city, from around the country. Students and members of the public then blocked Lepenicki Boulevard, the city’s main street. Groups of students from Novi Sad, Belgrade, Uzice, Kraljevo, Novi Pazar and Nis went to Kragujevac on foot, some of them walking for 150 kilometres. They were warmly greeted by locals in the city on Friday evening, after being hailed along the way in almost all the towns and villages they passed through. The rally in Kragujevac came 15 weeks after an outdoor canopy at Novi Sad railway station collapsed and left 15 people dead. Students have been blockading their universities since the end of November as well as holding mass protests and street blockades. The Kragujevac protest came two weeks after mass gathering in Novi Sad and some 20 days after a mass blockade of one of the major Belgrade intersections, the Autokomanda. Serbian President Vucic’s rally in Sremska Mitrovica also drew large crowds, although many of the attendees were public sector employees, some of whom are reported to have faced pressure to go to the pro-government rallies. It was the latest in a series of counter-protests aimed at reasserting Vucic’s authority in the face of the protests that pose a growing threat to his grip on power, which is facing its greatest political challenge since his Serbian Progressive Party came to power in 2012. Vucic told the crowd that the ongoing protests are a foreign-backed attempt at staging a 'colour revolution'. He said that 'the goal is to destroy Serbia', not just to overthrow his rule. The Novi Sad railway station deaths have fuelled anger over a perceived lack of transparency about how the state runs large infrastructure projects and a belief that public bodies are stuffed with party apparatchiks. The students leading the protests say they have four demands: the publication of all documents concerning the renovation of Novi Sad railway station; the prosecution of everyone involved in attacking students and professors during their protests and their dismissal if proven to be public officials; a halt to the prosecution of students arrested during the protests; and a 20 per cent increase in the budget for higher education.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZpudE0KpbDHJ	2025-02-15T16:11:56-08:00	
Robert Reich: Say What This Is, A Coup – OpEd	I want to talk today about the media’s coverage of the Trump-Vance-Musk coup. I’m not referring to coverage by the bonkers right-wing media of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News and its imitators. I’m referring to the U.S. mainstream media — The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, National Public Radio — and the mainstream media abroad, such as the BBC and The Guardian. By not calling it a coup, the mainstream media is failing to communicate the gravity of what is occurring. Yesterday’s opinion by The New York Times’ editorial board offers a pathetic example. It concedes that Trump and his top associates 'are stress-testing the Constitution, and the nation, to a degree not seen since the Civil War' but then asks: 'Are we in a constitutional crisis yet?' and answers that what Trump is doing 'should be taken as a flashing warning sign.' Warning sign? Elon Musk’s meddling into the machinery of government is a part of the coup. Musk and his muskrats have no legal right to break into the federal payments system or any of the other sensitive data systems they’re invading, for which they continue to gather computer code. This data is the lifeblood of our government. It is used to pay Social Security and Medicare. It measures inflation and jobs. Americans have entrusted our private information to professional civil servants who are bound by law to use it only for the purposes to which it is intended. In the wrong hands, without legal authority, it could be used to control or mislead Americans. By failing to use the term 'coup,' the media have also underplayed the Trump-Vance-Musk regime’s freeze on practically all federal funding — suggesting this is a normal part of the pull-and-tug of politics. It is not. Congress has the sole authority to appropriate money. The freeze is illegal and unconstitutional. By not calling it a coup, the media have also permitted Americans to view the regime’s refusal to follow the orders of the federal courts as a political response, albeit an extreme one, to judicial rulings that are at odds with what a president wants. There is nothing about the regime’s refusal to be bound by the courts that places it within the boundaries of acceptable politics. Our system of government gives the federal judiciary final say about whether actions of the executive are legal and constitutional. Refusal to be bound by federal court rulings shows how rogue this regime truly is. Earlier this week, a federal judge excoriated the regime for failing to comply with 'the plain text' of an edict the judge issued last month to release billions of dollars in federal grants. Vice President JD Vance, presumably in response, declared that 'judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.' Vance graduated from the same law school I did. He knows he’s speaking out of his derriere. In sum, the regime’s disregard for laws and constitutional provisions surrounding access to private data, impoundment of funds appropriated by Congress, and refusal to be bound by judicial orders amount to a takeover of our democracy by a handful of men who have no legal authority to do so. If this is not a coup d’etat, I don’t know what is. The mainstream media must call this what it is. In doing so, they would not be 'taking sides' in a political dispute. They would be accurately describing the dire emergency America now faces. Unless Americans see it and understand the whole of it for what it is rather than piecemeal stories that 'flood the zone,' Americans cannot possibly respond to the whole of it. The regime is undertaking so many outrageous initiatives that the big picture cannot be seen without it being described clearly and simply. Unless Americans understand that this is indeed a coup that’s wildly illegal and fundamentally unconstitutional — not just because that happens to be the opinion of constitutional scholars or professors of law, or the views of Trump’s political opponents, but because it is objectively and in reality a coup — Americans cannot rise up as the clear majority we are, and demand that democracy be restored.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZl8i5kwdxT2n	2025-02-15T16:09:14-08:00	
The Legacy Of Abandoned US Military Equipment In Afghanistan: A S...	The precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in August 2021 was a watershed and controversial moment in the history of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. While the decision to end the almost 20-year conflict was made with a desire to return American forces home, it has come hand in hand with an unwanted legacy: that of leaving behind an unfinished problem and a huge stock of American military hardware. This reservoir, whether it is high-level defense machinery, armor tanks, helicopters, and fighter aircraft, puts not only Afghanistan's future security but also American policy, international community relations, as well as war ethics to an extremely high degree of test. The Scope of Abandonment: From Advanced Technology to Tactical Equipment As the American troops left Afghanistan, they took with them approximately $7 billion of equipment, including more than 70 aircraft, 100,000 rifles, and a few hundred vehicles. Among the more visible equipment abandoned were Black Hawk helicopters, Humvees, and other cutting-edge surveillance and communications equipment, much of which has since made its way into the hands of the Taliban. It made people ask questions about the craziness of letting this cutting-edge equipment go to waste on the table to be picked up by the insurgents, potentially to be used for its capabilities by fueling an outfit that was notorious for both its human rights atrocities and destabilizing nature. To leave the tools behind like that was determined while in the grip of an fast-disintegrating security landscape within Afghanistan. The Biden administration had vowed to end America's longest war, but the precipitous fall of the Afghan government and military did not leave much time for thoughtful contemplation of what would be done with the gear. The US military responded that it would be logistically unfeasible to move all this enormous amount of material out of the country in the time allowed and under threat from the Taliban. But this wholesale abandonment of American arms is a simple question of morality: should such military critical equipment ever be left behind, even in withdrawal? It is faulted that the U.S. could have done more in disabling or destroying sensitive equipment to avoid unauthorized access. Others even deride the action to leave behind the equipment as a sign that the decision had not been given due thought by way of comparing the cost of the pace of withdrawal with detailed scrutiny of long-term stability of the region. Strategic Consequences: A New Reality for the Region The U.S. pullout and subsequent transfer of military hardware to the Taliban has radically altered regional power dynamics. For the Taliban, the provision of advanced American weaponry has emboldened its position as the de facto Afghanistan ruler. The group's ability to now employ military-grade technology can reasonably lock down its authority domestically, ward off regional neighbors, and menacingly challenge international counterterrorism initiatives more credibly. Apart from the Taliban, other U.S. military hardware is bound to land on the black market or be in the hands of other players in the region with interests in undermining the region. Pakistan, Iran, and Russia have a historical stake in Afghanistan's war effort and politics, and introducing advanced weaponry under the control of militia units would further strain already tense relations and complicate efforts at international diplomatic peace. Also, the presence of such advanced weapons of war by friendly or allied forces to terrorist groups poses an open danger to global security. The potential for such weapons to be employed in terrorist operations in the wider region or even beyond Afghanistan proper is one that cannot be ruled out. It is thus with a sense of grim foreboding that the majority foresee the security vacuum created by the American withdrawal echoing far beyond Afghan shores. Domestic and International Consequences: Responsibility and Prospective Policy The ditching of the military equipment sent shockwaves overseas but also set off hot debate at home within the U.S. itself. Military commanders, defense strategists, and politicians have all weighed in. To some, such a waste of this resource is an intolerable strategic error, undermining American credibility and America's ability to shape things on the planet. For others, it's the challenge of getting out from under today's military deployments and the complications involved in removing significant arms from use. What now for the United States regarding Afghanistan and national policy on being part of militaries in the fray? While some advocate more focus on diplomatic outreach and global cooperation, others argue that weapons abandonment highlights the need for a more guarded, measured approach to future military disengagement. Whether the U.S. will pursue further policy of disengagement or take more assertive measures to prevent future recurrences is unclear. Conclusion The record of American military materiel left behind in Afghanistan is a cautionary tale of the dangers of foreign intervention, military defeat, and the unintended consequences of hastily crafted policy decisions. As America tried to extricate itself from a twenty-year war, the aftereffects of its departure have bequeathed to Afghan security and foreign policy a deeply destabilizing legacy. The Taliban acquisition of the most advanced weapons, and the regional and global implications for security generally, are subjects for serious concern on the part of both America and its friends. With the dust beginning to settle on war, the international community is forced to confront that the baggage of war cannot easily be packed up in a duffel bag and abandoned. The question now is whether the U.S. can assume responsibility for what it has done and, in doing so, chart a path toward increased accountability and more responsible foreign policy in the years to come.

US-Europe Differences Come To The Fore At Munich Conference – OpE...	By Dr. Amal Mudallali The Munich Security Conference brought the fault lines between Europe and the US over Ukraine, the international order and the transatlantic relationship to the view of world leaders and political and security experts from the opening session of the conference on Friday. I was in the room to listen to the anticipated speech by US Vice President J.D. Vance and I saw the disbelief on people’s faces when he started speaking. The room was packed, with dozens of people standing on staircases and balconies to hear Vance in person for lack of seating availability. He did not disappoint in shocking them. When he was received with applause, he joked: 'I hope this is not the only applause I get.' He predicted correctly, and received polite applause only a couple of times. What shocked people most was not his lecturing them on democracy, especially free speech, and attacking them on immigration, but the fact that the American vice president’s speech in the foremost international security conference did not mention Ukraine even once, and did not talk about any security and foreign policy issue. He just put the Europeans on notice: There is a new sheriff in town. The Europeans were there for the message, and actually got it during their meetings with Vance before the opening of the conference. Their concern was evident in their speeches to the crowded halls of the conference venue. All the speeches were indirect or direct comments on the state of America and how Europe and the world should confront the phenomena called Donald Trump. From the opening statement of the conference’s chairman, Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, which highlighted 'the rule of law and not the law of the strongest,' to the strong messages in the speech of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, it was obvious that Europe is readying itself to push back. What rattled Europe most was the American president’s quick moves toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and their fears that they will be cut out of negotiations over ending the Ukraine war. You hear it everywhere: Europe and Ukraine should be at the table, and nothing about the war should be decided without Ukraine’s involvement. Some criticized the new US administration’s negotiating style, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius taking issue with giving everything at the start of talks. 'If I were (negotiating), I would know that I don’t take any essential point of negotiations off the table before the negotiations begin,' he said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that 'authoritarians are watching whether you have impunity if you invade your neighbor,' in a reference to Europe’s fear that the US administration’s peace overtures to Putin may embolden others to invade their neighbors and get away with it. Steinmeier highlighted how important it is not only to end the war, but to settle the conflict in a way that benefits Ukraine, Europe and the US. 'That outcome — an end to this war — is what we all hope for. How this war concludes will have a lasting impact on our security order and on the influence of both Europe and the US in the world,' he said, adding: 'I firmly believe that simply ‘making a deal and leaving’ would weaken us all: Ukraine and Europe but also the US. For this reason, every scenario — be it before or after the end of fighting — requires our combined power of deterrence and strength. That is why, in every scenario, support for Ukraine must continue — namely from Europe and the US.' This sentiment was also echoed by Von der Leyen, who said that Ukraine 'needs peace through strength.' But despite their warnings and aversion to the new US administration’s approach, they highlighted the importance of stepping up defense spending, a key ask by Trump. Steinmeier said: 'Expenditure on security must continue to rise. Our Bundeswehr must become stronger. Not to wage war — but to prevent war.' He seemed to respond to Trump’s request when he said: 'The 2 percent (defense spending) target, which we formally agreed in Wales in 2014, belongs to another era that was confronted with different threats. A decade on, we will need to spend considerably more than what was agreed back then.' Von der Leyen also called for stepping up military spending, and warned that Europe had outsourced its defense. The calls for Europe to stand up for itself were everywhere, as were the calls for unity but with the acknowledgment that Europe does not have the deterrent capability needed to confront the Putins of the world. But they seemed willing to resist. The words of the German president created the outlines of the push back by calling on Europe not to be intimidated by what is coming out of Washington. He said: 'We are subjects, not objects, in the international order. We must not allow ourselves to be paralyzed by the flood of announcements. We must not freeze in fear, or as the English saying goes: We cannot be like a deer in the headlights! It is clear that the new American administration holds a worldview that is very different from our own — one that shows no regard for established rules, for partnerships or for the trust that has been built over time.' This was only the first day of the conference but it set the tone for what is awaiting the transatlantic relationship in the era of an even stronger and more 'populist' US administration. This fear is real for Europe, and especially Germany, which faces crucial elections next week and where Vance met the far-right AfD leader and criticized efforts by German officials to avoid working with the party. It is a new era of what Europeans consider American election interference and America calls defense of democracy, which rests 'on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters.' It is the dawn of a new uncharted transatlantic fist fight.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZkMqhbXSisRU	2025-02-15T15:51:37-08:00	
Hamas Releases 3 More Israeli Hostages; Israel Frees More Prisone...	Hamas released three more hostages Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding despite recent tensions. Israeli American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, a resident of Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel, reportedly was taken captive when he confronted Hamas militants during their Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack in southern Israel. Two months after his capture, his wife, Avital, gave birth to their third daughter. Also released was Israeli Russian Sasha Troufanov, 29, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was taken prisoner in the Hamas attack, along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother Irina Tati and girlfriend Sapir Cohen. All three women were released in a hostage deal a month later. His father, Vitaly, was killed in the attack. The family emigrated to Israel from Russia 25 years ago. The third hostage released was identified as Israeli Argentinian Iair Horn, 46, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was kidnapped in the Hamas attack, along with his brother Eitan, who is not part of the current phase of the hostage deal. The three men were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis before being transported to Israeli forces. In Tel Aviv, family members and supporters watching the release via video cheered as the men emerged from vehicles at the site of the handover. Meanwhile, the first bus carrying freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees arrived in Ramallah to a cheering crowd waving Palestinian flags. Hamas said some 369 Palestinians were set to be released Saturday. It is the sixth swap of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners as part of the Jan. 19 ceasefire agreement between the two sides. Hamas said the hostages would be exchanged for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The militant group named the three hostages on Friday after threatening earlier in the week to not release them, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement. During the first phase of the ceasefire, set to last six weeks, Hamas is to gradually free 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Twenty-one hostages and more than 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed, so far, during the first phase of the truce. Concerns in Israel have grown about the condition of the remaining hostages after the last three hostages, released a week ago, came home looking emaciated. On Thursday, Hamas spokesperson Abdul-Latif al-Qanou indicated the militant group would abide by the ceasefire. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation [Israeli forces] adheres to it fully,' he said. Qanou also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. The Israeli government later reiterated that Hamas must release three hostages this weekend. 'If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end,' Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed Saturday. Also Friday, at the United Nations headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. Security Council that more than 630 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza on Thursday, with at least 300 of them heading to the northern section of Gaza. He urged the Security Council and all U.N. member states to support efforts to implement the ceasefire and bring about a permanent cessation of hostilities. He also called for the international media to be allowed into Gaza to report on the situation on the ground. Meanwhile, U.N. ambassadors from the 22-nation Arab Group rejected Trump’s proposal Friday for the U.S. to take over control of the Gaza Strip and for Palestinians to be relocated elsewhere. They also expressed their own desire to see Gaza rebuilt for Palestinians. Speaking at U.N. headquarters in New York, the group’s chairman, U.N. Ambassador from Kuwait Tareq Albanai, said the suggested displacement of Palestinians from Gaza would constitute 'a clear violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, prohibiting the forcible transfer of protected populations from occupied territories, irrespective of motive.' U.N. Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour said Palestinians would like to see Gaza rebuilt as Trump imagined, only for the Palestinians. 'We have no homeland except Palestine,' he said. 'We love Palestine. We will rebuild the Gaza Strip. We will rebuild Palestine.' Mansour said the group also was strongly united behind the current ceasefire agreement and to make it permanent, and for it to be expanded to include not only Gaza but the occupied West Bank as well. The Arab Group also extended an invitation to the U.N. Security Council to visit Gaza. VOA’s Natasha Mozgovaya and Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZlNW_kmnPV4P	2025-02-15T15:49:11-08:00	
Pakistan’s Recent PECA Amendments: A New Threat To Free Speech An...	The new Pakistan Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) amendments have raised a great deal of concern regarding the nation's devotion to free speech and democracy. Although the amendments cut back the three-year imprisonment for spreading false information via the internet to three years, they are followed by a chain of contentious provisions that have triggered alarm at increasing repression of dissent and freedom of speech. The amendments invoked huge protests and outrage from journalists, civil society, and opposition forces, who branded the new laws as instruments of state oppression. A Step Towards Greater Government Interference Four institutions will be created by the government through amendments: the Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, the National Cybercrime Investigation Authority, the Social Media Complaint Council, and the Social Media Protection Tribunal(s). They are to silence false news, but the open federal government process of selection has raised alarms of government intrusion and censorship. These appeals will directly go to the Supreme Court and not to the high courts, and this has raised concerns from critics that this will be centralizing power and denying access to independent judicial appeals. The new legislation also subjects those convicted of spreading false news on the internet to severe punishment, up to 2 million rupees (about $7,000). Although the actions might be seen as a move to limit the spread of false news, they also open doors for political and social activists, journalists, to be arrested in the guise of limiting the spread of false news. A Suppression-of-Free-Speech Law Signed in 2016, PECA was signed into law initially to combat cyber crime, yet it has been characterized as one of the steps towards suppressing free speech for a number of decades. The bill has been criticized for containing extremely vague and broad language, which has been employed in harassing media professionals and journalists. Over 200 cases have been reported against journalists since its inception, and the majority of individuals convicted argue that the government is employing PECA in order to silence opposition voices. The new amendments, the critics alleged, will again maximize the chocking effect of the law on freedom of expression. The Pakistan Human Rights Commission (HRCP) protested as a move toward direct violation of fundamental human rights. The HRCP noted that the three years' imprisonment for broadcasting unsubstantiated news was disproportionate and sounded an alarm that four new watch-dogging institutions can be utilized to choke independent media. Mass Protests and Increasing Resistance Journalists and media employees' protests against the PECA amendments have been ongoing in Pakistan since they were implemented. Protests were held on January 28 in major cities across the country, demanding the bill be withdrawn. The PFUJ condemned the amendments as a 'black law' that would silence the media and choke democratic rights. International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) also extended its support in the form of protests, and it issued a solidarity statement for the PFUJ and appealed for the rollback of the legislation. The IFJ, while issuing a statement, referred to the need for safeguarding freedom of expression as an organic right. Civil society organizations have also criticized the amendments, saying that they are a step backward. Human rights activist Ammar Ali Jan's tweets asserted that PECA amendments were one of 'many ways in which the government is attempting to criminalize dissent' and silence state critics. Political parties on both sides of the political spectrum have also condemned the amendments. The opponents within the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party have vowed to form a political alliance in order to vote against the law, stating that the law would be employed to harass civil society and the media. That it occurred at this worst possible time is particularly shameful to Pakistan's record regarding human rights in matters of freedom of expression and the press, too. In 2024, the country scored 152 out of a total of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, and the proposed amendments will certainly further tarnish its image globally. Politicians, journalists, and even the ordinary citizen would be heavily penalized for the articulation of an opinion other than the one articulated by the state in the new PECA. The threat of ending up in prison or heavy punishment for simply disseminating information or criticism regarding the government would cause mass-level self-censorship, eliminating whatever is left of the freedom to discourse for the masses. The government action also seems to go against Pakistan's democratic tradition. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who had criticized PECA in the previous government while his opposition party was in power, has been accused of hypocrisy after supporting the same contentious bill as a ruling party. His seeming u-turn has fueled rumors that the government is abusing the law to further centralize power and silence the opposition. A Bad Precedent Pakistan's media space is already under attack with routine suspension of the internet and rising restrictions on social media. The PECA amendments offer the window for the malevolent precedent by placing unchecked power in the hands of the state on the expression on the internet and transforming the law into a tool of muzzling the opposition voice against the regime. As protest intensifies and demos mount, it was only time which could determine whether the law had been overturned or even modified so as to make speech as free. However, as increasing authoritarian bent dominates the Pakistani political arena, it is every reason to believe that the nation is being inched towards a trajectory of increasing state repression and control.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZpevdTdSs13G	2025-02-15T15:46:42-08:00	
Ecumenical Initiative Calls For Unity To Celebrate Easter Togethe...	By Victoria Cardiel The First Ecumenical Council, the meeting of Christian bishops that was held in 325 in Nicaea (today İznik, Turkey), laid the groundwork for reaching consensus within the Church through an assembly representing all of Christendom. This event marked a key moment in the history of Christianity, 17 centuries ago this year, in which, among other decisions, the way of calculating the date of Easter was established. However, over the centuries, changes to the calendar resulted in discrepancies between the Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox churches, differences that still persist. While Latin-rite Catholics follow the Gregorian calendar, in the East the tradition of calculating liturgical dates according to the Julian calendar has been maintained. The difficulties of changing the calendar 'The process of changing the calendar, which began in 1582 with Pope Gregory and was completed to a certain extent in 1923 with the adoption of the new calendar by some Orthodox churches, was not without difficulties,' Kostas Mygdalis, consultant to the Orthodox Interparliamentary Assembly (IOA), explained in an interview with ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. 'It provoked controversies among the faithful and between the churches and state authorities, consolidating polarizing divisions' that still persist, he added. Mygdalis is also one of the key figures of the interfaith working group Pasqua (Easter) Together 2025, which seeks to promote the common celebration of Easter between Orthodox and Catholics. Last September, Pope Francis received the members of this ecumenical initiative and expressed his desire to agree on a common date for the celebration of Easter between Catholics and Orthodox. Interestingly, this year both Easters — Catholic and Orthodox — fall on the same date, April 20, due to the alignment of the Julian (used by the Orthodox) and Gregorian (followed by Catholics and other Christian denominations) calendars. A step toward Christian unity For Mygdalis, the joint celebration of Easter in 2025 should not be seen as just a calendar agreement but as an opportunity to place Christ at the center of the Christian faith. 'The time has come to make a strong appeal to the churches to unify the date of Easter,' he said. He also emphasized that the central message must be the need for unity in the world: 'The world needs unity. A common date for Easter is a step toward this unity.' However, he noted that 'the administrative structures of the churches, composed almost exclusively of clerics, seem reluctant to address this issue, perhaps for fear of creating new extremism and divisions in a world already facing multiple challenges.' He also pointed out that 'dialogue between Christian churches is moving so slowly that, for ordinary faithful, it seems a fruitless process.' For Mygdalis, the effort to celebrate the resurrection of Christ together must be part of a 'pilgrimage of reconciliation and unity' that will continue beyond 2025. He emphasized that the importance of the Resurrection is not only theological but also existential: 'Without the Resurrection, all the suffering in the world is absurd.' A mandate for unity from Nicaea 'The celebration of Easter on a common date is not only necessary but a mandate for unity established by the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea, whose 1,700th anniversary we commemorate this year,' he emphasized. 'Through the Pasqua Together 2025 initiative, we seek to demand that the churches comply with what was established by the Council of Nicaea: to celebrate together the resurrection of Christ, the pillar of the Christian faith. It is unacceptable that this division should continue,' he pointed out. Toward the jubilee of 2033 Beyond Easter 2025, the JC2033 initiative was also mentioned, which proposes an ecumenical journey toward the year 2033, when the 2,000th anniversary of the resurrection of Christ will be celebrated. It is suggested that the date of Easter for Orthodox and Catholics coinciding in 2025 could be a first step toward greater unity on the occasion of this historic celebration.

Iran Confirms Exchange Of Messages With Syria	A special envoy of the Iranian foreign minister acknowledged that messages have been exchanged with Syria. The Iranian foreign minister’s special envoy for Syria, Mohammad Reza Raouf Sheibani, confirmed the recent comments from the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Syrian Transitional Government Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani about the exchange of positive messages between Tehran and Damascus. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran is indirectly in contact with Syria’s current officials, and we have also received messages,' the Iranian diplomat said. He said Iran has a forward-looking attitude to the developments in Syria and the restoration of ties with the Arab country. Iran is closely and patiently monitoring the situation in Syria and will make its appropriate decisions in due time, Sheibani said. Stressing the need for all political currents to have a role in shaping Syria’s future, the Iranian special envoy said, 'Iran’s stances on the Damascus developments are clear. Considering Syria’s special position in the Middle East region, we believe that its future and fate must be decided by its own people with the participation of all political currents.' Expressing Iran’s opposition to any foreign interference in the internal affairs of Syria, Sheibani said he has discussed Syria with the representative of Russia’s president and the Russian deputy foreign minister during a recent visit to Moscow. Iran and Russia share views about a series of issues regarding Syria, he stated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZnd6e_eLfHF8	2025-02-15T15:41:45-08:00	
The Taliban’s War On Women: A Nation’s Daughters In Peril – OpEd	Since the Taliban’s swift and brutal takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the country has experienced profound shifts in every facet of life, particularly for women. The collapse of the U.S.-backed government marked the beginning of a new, grim chapter for Afghan women, whose rights have been systematically stripped away. Under the Taliban’s interpretation of Islamic law, women face unprecedented levels of repression, which have led to their near-total erasure from public and private life. The situation for women in Afghanistan is complex, shaped by a combination of cultural, religious, and historical factors that have entrenched patriarchal norms and restricted women's roles in society. However, it is the recent, increasingly absurd measures enforced by the Taliban that truly highlight the extent of their control and disregard for women’s fundamental human rights. One of the most striking examples of the Taliban's misogynistic policies is the imposition of stringent rules on women’s visibility, even in their own homes. The Taliban have now taken the extraordinary step of banning windows that allow women to be seen from outside. This decree, dubbed the 'window test,' mandates that homes should not have any windows overlooking places where women might be seen, including kitchens and courtyards. According to a Taliban spokesperson, 'seeing a woman working in kitchens, in courtyards, or collecting water from wells can lead to obscene acts.' While it is absurd to claim that the mere sight of women going about their daily tasks can provoke immorality, this new rule reflects the Taliban’s obsession with controlling every aspect of women’s existence, even their private, domestic spaces. These extreme measures follow a long list of restrictions that have been imposed on women since the Taliban regained power. Afghan women are no longer allowed to attend school beyond primary education, with secondary and higher education completely banned for girls. Employment opportunities for women have been drastically reduced, with the government ordering thousands of women to leave their jobs, especially in government offices. Women are not permitted to travel without a male chaperone, and they are forced to cover their faces fully when in public. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs has been dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Vice and Virtue, a clear indication that the Taliban see women as subjects to be controlled, not as individuals with rights to be respected. The Taliban's strict rules are not limited to women's mobility or education, they also extend to healthcare. Women in Afghanistan are prohibited from seeking medical care unless it is provided by a female healthcare worker. This restriction has led to a shortage of essential medical services, particularly for women who are already suffering from the devastating effects of the Taliban's policies, including an increase in maternal mortality rates and a growing suicide epidemic among women. The country’s healthcare system, already fragile before the Taliban’s return, has been further crippled by the absence of women from the workforce. The oppression of Afghan women under the Taliban is not only a violation of their rights but also a self-inflicted wound on the country’s economy. By excluding women from the workforce, the Taliban have effectively reduced the country’s labor force by half, plunging Afghanistan into deeper poverty. The economy, already suffering from decades of conflict and international sanctions, has been dealt a further blow by the systematic exclusion of women from key sectors such as education, healthcare, and governance. This gender-based discrimination is not only a moral failure but also an economic one, as it prevents the country from fully utilizing its human resources. The international community has largely condemned the Taliban’s actions, but the regime has found ways to maintain its grip on power despite the widespread outcry. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, but the group has made significant diplomatic strides. Several countries have welcomed Taliban diplomats, and there have been discussions about removing the group from international terrorism lists. These diplomatic victories represent a troubling reality: while the international community continues to turn a blind eye to the horrors women face under the Taliban, the regime is gaining recognition on the global stage. For Afghan women, this is nothing short of a betrayal. They are denied basic human rights, subjected to violence and oppression on a daily basis, and yet the world continues to engage with the Taliban as though they are a legitimate government. More than 300 women have been killed by men since the Taliban’s return to power, and over 840 women have been victims of violence. The Taliban themselves are often implicated in these crimes. The world’s failure to hold the Taliban accountable for these atrocities sends a chilling message to Afghan women: their suffering is invisible and irrelevant. In addition to the physical and psychological violence they endure, Afghan women are also forced to confront the constant fear of being punished for even the smallest transgressions. Women who are found begging in the streets for food or money can be arrested, detained, and subjected to brutal treatment by the Taliban. The Taliban's repressive measures have left Afghan women with little recourse but to retreat further into isolation, where they are often left to fend for themselves in a society that views them as little more than second-class citizens. The question that many Afghan women are asking is simple yet profound: why are they being silenced and erased from public life? Are they not human beings? Are they not entitled to the same basic rights as men? The international community must not ignore the cries of Afghan women, who are living under a regime that seeks to strip them of their dignity, their rights, and their futures. The situation in Afghanistan may have become a forgotten war, but it is a war in which one group of people, Afghan women, continues to lose. The world must wake up to their suffering and take concrete steps to support them in their struggle for freedom and equality. The Taliban's treatment of women in Afghanistan is a grave injustice that must be confronted by the global community. If we continue to turn a blind eye to their plight, we are complicit in their oppression. It is time to stand up for the women of Afghanistan, whose voices have been silenced, whose rights have been stripped away, and whose futures have been stolen. Only by recognizing their humanity and supporting their fight for freedom can we hope to end the suffering of Afghan women.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZvhg6exDPqRd	2025-02-15T15:38:41-08:00	
Build Defence ‘Indic’ AI-Language Models In India – Analysis	By Jui Marathe and Chaitanya Giri India's Ministry of Defence (MoD) started 2025 by deeming it the ‘Year of Reforms’. This year, it has pledged its focus on emerging technologies, especially robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). The theme, of course, is an organic continuation of its 2024 theme, the ‘Year of Technology Absorption, Empowering the Soldier’. The usual perception is that the soldier needs only to be empowered on the battlefield and during combat; But that is not entirely true. Assisting the soldier in diverse non-battlefield use-cases - internal administration, allocation of business rules, logistics, command and brigade level procurement, personnel re-education and training, wargaming, disaster search and rescue, military doctrine and technology ethics - goes a long way in making the military more efficient. Artificial intelligence (AI) absorption has already begun within the Indian Armed Forces for non-battlefield use cases. But it cannot be merely users of AI; its ability to cultivate and enhance national AI capabilities must be exploited. Since its establishment in 2018, the MoD’s Defence Artificial Intelligence Projects Agency (DAIPA), along with the Indian Armed Forces, created a pipeline of bespoke AI tools, such as chatbots, audiobots, and videobots, used as non-battlefield soldier virtual assistants, at par with militaries worldwide. In April 2024, the Indian Army Southern Command, as part of its technology absorption drive, built an AI chatbot called SAMADHAN that assists commissioned officers with queries related to public procurement and related policies. Another Indian Army-led chatbot, SAMBANDH, is built purposefully to assist war veterans and war widows in addressing, through one-on-one communications, their queries and grievances and disseminating relevant information amongst them. Similar to SAMADHAN and SAMBANDH, in 2023, the US-based information technology services company World Wide Technology Inc. introduced ‘SergeantAI’, an AI virtual assistant that helps soldiers, particularly non-commissioned officers, adhere to the US Army regulations. The China’s Joint Operations College, National Defence University has created a ‘Virtual AI Commander’, an AI avatar of a real-world Chinese commander, to assist soldiers at lower ranks with table-top simulations and virtual war games when the real-world commander is unavailable for simulations. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Sciences has also developed an AI chatbot called ChatBIT to assist soldiers and intelligence officials in support of their military intelligence operations and enhance their decision-making ability. After the assimilation of AI virtual assistants in phase 1 of AI adoption, phase 2 involves the construction of bespoke defence large language models (LLMs). The US AI company Scale AI, in November 2024, announced the launch of Defense Llama, an LLM built on Meta’s Llama 3, that is customised to serve US national security missions, particularly carrying out intelligence operations, preparing for counter operations, and comprehending vulnerabilities of adversaries. The Defense Llama LLM is said to have been trained on an enormous dataset, including military doctrines, DoD policies, guidelines and Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence. The end-users of Defense Llama are the operators of command and control platforms, intelligence agencies, and decision-support systems. The Chinese PLA, now armed with the confidence of the indigenous DeepSeek V3 LLM’s success, may not want to depend on Meta or any other American foundational models for its military applications. Mandarin-language LLMs, built by Chinese AI companies, such as Yi, Qwen, Baichuan, XVERSE, are already performing well in Simplified Mandarin, Traditional Mandarin, Chinese ethnic minority languages like Kazakh, Jinghpo, Lhasa Tibetan, and a few other East Asian languages. The PLA could soon use its Sinic language superiority to create Sinic language defence LLMs for itself. Such Sinic language defence LLMs could be used for the enormous diversity of non-battlefield defence applications. Taking cues from this, the Indian MoD should consider being the benefactor of bespoke multilingual Indic-language defence LLMs. Any AI language model is usually based on parameters such as ontologies, grammar, lexicons, and corpora,derived from databases of commonsensical facts written in a certain spoken and written language. Depending on the scale and size of the databases, the parameters in it are determined. As of January 2025, the current state-of-the-art LLMs have as many as 1.56 trillion parameters, of course, based on English language databases. However, India is in an advantageous position to have world-leading India-built Indic language LLMs. To attain such an advantageous position, it would be important to give such Indic LLMs enormous parameters from the richness of textual and audiovisual data in the possession of public sector entities. The MoD, being the largest employer in the country, could have its own Indic language defence LLM initiative given the enormous Indic and English language repositories it holds. Although there has been some unwanted scepticism about India pursuing indigenously-built LLMs, there is considerable potential for Indian AI companies to dominate the niche of Indic languages. In the context of this article and its ideation, Indic languages include Hindi and other 21 official languages in the country. The Indian open-source AI startup Sarvam 2B’s Indic language small language model (SLM), although based on a modified Llama architecture, is performing much better in Indic languages than models from American foundational SLMs. So, if the MoD chooses to be the benefactor of Indic language LLMs—as closed-source models given the data sensitivity and network security—and offer its massive database, to set up parameters, it would not only end up building a closed-source defence LLM for its intramural usage, but also encourage a massive use-case for wider use of Indic language across other sectors. But how should the MoD do it? The Indian military’s first major steps in emerging technology upskilling and capacity building, including those for AI, were announced in 2025, when the Indian Army stated its ongoing plans to induct emerging technology domain specialists mid-2025 onwards through the Army Education Corps, which was recently renamed the Army Knowledge & Enablers Corps. Domain specialists with postgraduate degrees will be inducted into the commissioned officer ranks, while experts with graduate degrees will be inducted at the junior commissioned officers’ ranks. Within the MoD, it is the junior-commissioned and non-commissioned ranks, a sizable portion of the MoD non-military personnel, Agniveer, Territorial Army, and National Cadet Corps that generate and consume voluminous official content and data in the Indic language, particularly Hindi. This data consumption and generation aligns with the Official Language Act of 1963, and it is this voluminous content gathered over many decades and across all MoD and other Indian governmental institutions that could be digitised and used to set parameters for the closed-source Indic language defence LLMs. Of course, the English language data repository could be translated the way STEM academic textbooks are being translated to Hindi and other Indic languages under the AI Project Udaan carried out by IIT Bombay. This will further add to the enormity of parameters, a necessity for a richly fed LLM. The Army Knowledge & Enablers Corps could create an ecosystem in partnership with DAIPA, DRDO, private AI companies, and civilian government laboratories. If our soldiers are to fight time-space-force-informationwars, if they have to be the human-in-loop of sophisticated systems, their acquaintance with the operations of AI systems is crucial. The AI system they work on must operate in the language they think in and speak. Furthermore, the Indic language defence LLM could also benefit the ‘Project Udbhav’ - the Indian Army’s program to synthesize ancient scripted wisdom on warfare, statecraft, historical missions, and ethics with modern-day military operations. Bringing such Sanskrit and other Indic language texts into the training and upskilling curriculum of the Army Training Command and College of Defence Management will have a tremendous impact on empowering the soldier. An Indic language LLM will be a milestone development towards the Indian government’s extant commitment to promoting Indic languages.

How Trump’s Gaza Plan Could Hand The Middle East To Russia And Ch...	U.S. President Donald Trump recently called the Gaza Strip a 'demolition site,' and said the Palestinians would be evacuated to Jordan and Egypt, where they would be 'thrilled' to live. The U.S. would then take possession of Gaza ('We'll own it’), and would develop it, creating 'thousands of jobs,' making it the 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted the project, 'it’s something that could change history,' and it will, but probably not the way he and Trump think. Netanyahu called Trump’s idea to deport the Gazans 'remarkable' and the 'first good idea I've heard,' but just about everyone, everywhere reacted negatively to the plan. The White House quickly clarified the U.S. won’t pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, and it hasn’t made any commitment to send U.S. troops there, but an American private security company will be manning a key Gaza checkpoint and armed American military veterans wearing military-style garb will be as big a target as serving troops and will be valuable hostages. In the U.S., many Arab American voters wondered if they made a mistake supporting Trump in 2024, and one Arab-American group rebranded, removing 'Trump' from its name. According to Pew Research, Muslims will become the second-largest religious group in the U.S. by 2050 and is a demographic the Republicans needs to capture. Jews continued voting for Democrats in 2024 (79% voted for Democrat candidate Kamala Harris; 21% voted for Trump, 'the lowest proportion of Jewish votes for a Republican presidential candidate in 24 years.') Thus, the GOP may secure no net gain in votes and may suffer in the 2026 mid-term elections, so why bother doing this? In the Middle East, every leader, even the philosemitic Mohamed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, denounced Trump’s idea and Netanyahu’s suggestion that Saudi Arabia host a Palestinian state. The Saudis added they would never normalize relations with Israel if the Palestinians are deported: 'the Kingdom’s position is nonnegotiable.' (Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman previously boxed in the kingdom by declaring Israel’s actions in Gaza as 'genocide,' precluding a quiet policy reversal at a later date.) Jordan and Egypt, which Trump expects to host nearly 2 million Palestinians, have the most to lose by receiving angry, involuntary emigrants that will be a destabilizing element. And any bridge funding to support the resettlement will soon dry up, sticking Cairo and Amman with the bill, while the investors in Gaza (who will demand government guarantees) reap the rewards, a sure example of 'socializing the costs but externalizing the benefits.' The Israel Defense Forces are drawing up plans for the departure of Palestinians from Gaza though it remains to be seen how 'voluntary' the departures will be if there are no early takers, especially as the refugees will probably land in a refugee camp but with little support from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). If the Soviet deportation expert, Ivan Serov, wrote a how-to guide they are probably reading it at HaKirya. Trump threatened to stop all financial aid to Egypt and Jordan if they refuse to accept the Palestinian deportees from Gaza. King Addullah of Jordan met Trump and held the line by committing to take in 2,000 Palestinian orphans for medical treatment; President el-Sisi of Egypt was slated to meet Trump in mid-February but now will not travel to Washington if the Gaza deportations are on the agenda. El-Sisi may try to assuage Trump temporarily be accepting some sick refugee kids, but Egypt or Jordan probably don’t have the housing stock or social services to accommodate two million angry refugees. Then there will be the opprobrium of being an accomplice to the Second Nakba which will present physical risk to the two leaders, both of whom have predecessors who were assassinated in office. The Nakba of 1948 has been laid at the feet of Israel, but the Second Nakba will attach itself firmly to America, allowing Israel to escape any accountability. Executing this plan will cause the deaths of more Israelis and Palestinians, but that is a sacrifice Netanyahu is willing to make. And the U.S. knows a thing or two about deportations, so it should avoid recommending that policy to others. In the late 1800s it used its army to force the Plains Indians from the grasslands where they lived for 8,000 years onto reservations where many of their descendants still live in poverty today. Key to the success of this strategy was killing off the buffalo the Indians relied on for food. In the words of an U.S. Army officer, 'Kill every buffalo you can! Every buffalo dead is an Indian gone.' When asked if the Palestinians would have a right of return, Trump replied, 'No, they wouldn’t…I’m talking about building a permanent place for them,' though the Palestinians would say they have a 'permanent place' already. Hamas responded that the Trump plan is 'a recipe for failure,' and on this the region’s kings and emirs agree with the Islamist insurgents. In the future, the U.S. will find little support in the region for fighting terrorism, suppressing the Houthi attacks on shipping, partnering with American businesses, and stopping Iran’s nuclear program. And as 10 of the 12 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are majority Muslim, Washington won’t get any help with oil prices. Even if this situation freezes today, America’s competitors will still take gains as confidence in the U.S. has been hurt, perhaps permanently. If the U.S. stops aid to Jordan and Egypt, they may still make up the loss by soliciting funds from China, Russia, India, Turkey, and the Persian Gulf petrostates, giving the donors more sway in the area. The U.S. may no longer be viewed as the region’s key political partner, but just as the security provider, the 'hired muscle' that can be assuaged by regular purchases of weapons. But China will be the preferred investor and technology provider, Russia will be a source of foodstuffs and military aid, and India and Turkey can be providers of other engineering and technology goods and services. For a guy who is social media savvy, Trump is hurting himself. He promised Khabib Nurmagomedov, the popular Russian (and Muslim) champion martial arts fighter, 'We will stop it. I will stop the war [in Gaza].' This is what an influencer look like: Khabib has 39.6 million followers on Instagram, 8.6 million followers on X, 5.5 million followers on Facebook, and 1.23 million subscribers on YouTube. If Khabib is disappointed with Trump, he can move the needle with the region’s youth and not to America’s gain. Who benefits? Aside from Israeli extremists and their American supporters, Russia and China will appear as beacons of principle and friendship. Islamist groups will say 'I told you so' and start new fundraising and recruiting drives, and Iran can head into negotiations with America for a new nuclear deal declaring the U.S. is only reliable when it comes to backing out its commitments, to wit, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and the two-state solution. And the future Arab and Muslim position on the two-state solution may change: no more of that 'pathway to Palestinian statehood' stuff; in the future, there will be no recognition of Israel until the Palestinian prime minister is in office, the parliament is in session, the borders are secure, and the postage stamps are in circulation. Washington could have avoided this by forcing Israel and Palestine into negotiations after the announcement of the Abraham Accords, but everyone just pocketed their winnings and moved on. If the two sides had been locked in a room in Dayton, Ohio with an overbearing American overseer and no hope of appealing to the White House, the Accords momentum and the prospect of outsized economic gains may have worked, but that moment was lost, and Hamas reaped the benefits. And speaking of Hamas, we keep hearing they lost, but the last Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, confessed Hamas has recruited almost as many fighters as it lost. Obviously, Washington and Tel Aviv do not understand the math: Palestinian orphans = Hamas recruits. And the Hamas handovers of Israeli hostages have been media spectacles that raised the group’s profile as undefeated defenders of the Palestinian people and underlined the reputational damage America has suffered by its laissez-faire reaction to the Israeli attack on Gaza. The American idea will engender resistance, some violent, that Washington will call 'terrorism' to avoid any discussion of the immediate idea or its long-term history in the Middle East. There is nothing good here for America, and the American people agree; only 13% think it’s a 'good idea,' and 47% think it’s a 'bad idea,' according to a CBS News/YouGov poll. This may cost the Republicans seats in the 2026 mid-term elections, will isolate the U.S., give Russia and China more opportunity in the region, and possibly engender support for Iran when it faces off against the U.S. and Europe in nuclear negotiations, or grapples with the next round of sanctions. Trump’s best next step is to noisily pivot to something else and leave this bad idea on Netanyahu’s doorstep.

Will The Putin-Trump Meeting Surpass The Yalta Agreement? – Analy...	Its not just about an agreement to end the Russo-Ukraine conflict With US president Donald Trump’s one and a half hour call to Russian president Putin and Munich being the neutral place both parties are planning to meet, there is expectation of a new Yalta type understanding being agreed to by both parties. This is the first a US president has spoken to Putin since February 2022. In an interview with Russia 1 television on Thursday, Peskov described the conversation as constructive, adding that the two leaders concurred that the administration of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden had done 'enormous damage' to US-Russian relations. Putin and Trump agreed that 'even the most complex problems should be resolved through peace negotiations,' according to Peskov. Aside from extending invitations to each other to visit their respective nations, the two heads of state 'agreed to quite swiftly organize and hold a working meeting somewhere in a third country,' the official stated. Hours after the phone call on Wednesday, Trump told journalists at the White House that the talks would take place in Saudi Arabia. The location has been changed to Munich. Meetings between high level officials of both Russia and the United States are due to occur later today at the Munich Security Conference. The Munich Security Conference is taking place from February 14 to 16 in Munich, Germany. US Vice President J.D. Vance will lead the American delegation at the MSC, where he is expected to meet with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the conference is an opportunity for American officials to 'lay out a broad path forward' on Ukraine. Meanwhile, US presidential envoy for the Ukraine conflict Keith Kellogg is reportedly expected to make it clear that the US has no intention of deploying troops to protect Ukraine and wants European NATO allies to increase their defense spending. Over the last couple of days Russia and the United States have exchanged prisoners are expressions of good will. President Trump has said that Ukraine will never join NATO and that Russia should rejoin the G8. Former Russian president Medvedev has said that it was the former US administration that made a ‘grave mistake’ with Russia, setting Russian-US negotiations for a fresh start. It looks like Trump is stirring US foreign and defence policy away from Europe. Some pundits even say the US is abandoning them. The US has cut free of Ukraine, and NATO countries for these negotiations. This leaves discussions open between Putin and Trump, with only their respective advisors present. A new Yalta understanding There is a possibility that this upcoming meeting may become just as significant than the Yalta meeting between Winston Churchill of Great Britain, Franklin D Roosevelt of the United States and Joseph Stalin of the USSR, on the southern coast of the Crimean Peninsula back in 1945, when the post WWII world was shaped and defined. Both Putin and Trump have a sense of destiny that may not only influence the end of the Ukraine war and how Ukraine will look, but shape and define Russian and US spheres of influence in Europe and Central Asia in the future. If such an agreement is met, then Putin and Trum will go a long way to shaping what the world will look like from 2025 onwards. Such an agreement would secure Russia’s position in Asia and allow the US to refocus upon the western hemisphere. Its very likely Putin is well aware of Chinese and Iranian interests and will steer the agreement towards a direction, where an even more comprehensive agreement might be made further in 2025. Defining spheres of influence will open the doors to multi-polar national cooperation between nations. However, this mish be speculating to far ahead at this stage. However, there might be some thinking along those lines in the heads of both leaders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP5jCAGuT2RmQ	2025-02-14T18:22:28-08:00	
Military Infiltrations Undermine Thailand’s Democratization – Ana...	Since the abolition of the absolute monarchy in 1932, Thailand has alternated between periods of relatively democratic rule and military coups. Officially, there have been 13 successful coups, but the attempted coups, which have been extensively gossiped about in the media, are countless. The last official coup took place in 2014 and brought to power General Prayuth Chan-Ocha, now a Privy Councillor to the king. The democratically elected government led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck Shinawatra was accused of fiddling with rice subsidies. She, like her brother, fled abroad. After five years of military rule, Thailand returned to a military-dominated, semi-elected government in 2019. The combination of economic and political decline, and frustrations over the role of the monarchy, military, and political elite in governing Thailand, led to large demonstrations in 2020 and 2021. In response, the authorities used repressive tactics, including arbitrary arrests, intimidation, and accusations of lèse-majesté. The May 2023 elections called by the military-conservative coalition brought little relief, with two opposition parties -- the Move Forward Party (MFP) with 14 million voters and the Pheu Thai Party (PTP) with 10.6 million -- winning the most votes. Led by the charismatic Pita Limjaroenrat, 42, a Harvard graduate with a background in business, the MFP sought to reform Thailand’s strict royal insult laws, leading to a clash with the kingdom’s powerful royalist-military elite. Although the 2023 elections were relatively open and competitive, the leading opposition party, Move Forward (MFP), was blocked from forming a government by the military-appointed Senate. The other opposition group, Thaksin’s Pheu Thai Party (PTP) (of so-called red shirts), entered the government in a coalition with 11 (yellow) military-affiliated parties, which resulted in the Srettha coalition government on August 21, 2023. Alternative newssite KhaoSod called it a 'silent coup.' Pheu Thai, which appealed to voters with populist promises such as tackling corruption, raising the minimum wage and providing a digital wallet for the less wealthy, has not been able to achieve much of that. It did succeed in bringing Thaksin back to Thailand, and in having his relatively inexperienced daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra appointed Prime Minister after a tug-of-war in front of and behind the scenes. Trouble over a book Those who only occasionally follow the political goings-on in Thailand are sometimes in for a surprise. Apart from some positive reviews, hardly anything has been said in Thailand about the academic book 'Infiltrating Society: The Thai Military’s Internal Security Affairs', which was published in 2021 by the renowned Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. It was available in better bookstores (such as Asia Books) and online. The author is Puangthong R. Pawakapan, Associate Professor at the Department of International Relations, Faculty of Political Science, at the rather conservative-royalist Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. Her work focuses on the Thai military, including internal security affairs. She also maintains a digital archive of documents on the October 6, 1976, massacre. 'It takes not only skill but courage for a Thailand-based scholar to explain so clearly how the military infiltrated society in an effort to build support for its conservative, royalist policies,' argues Andrew J. Nathan, in Foreign Affairs. However, when a forum was announced in late September 2024 to launch the Thai version of Puangthong’s book, published by Same Sky Books (ฟ้าเดียวกัน), it was suddenly cancelled by Chulalongkorn University. The event was moved to the Jim Thompson Museum. Maj Gen Winthai Suwari, the spokesman for ISOC (Internal Security Operations Command), the military’s political wing, strongly criticized the book’s content, claiming it was poorly researched and contained a lot of misinformation. He called for the book to be stopped from being sold. Maj Gen Suwari said the book damaged the image of the military and questioned the author’s qualifications and academic background. He said Puangthong had no experience in security matters. In her response, posted on Facebook, Puangthong argues that her book is based on research and information provided and endorsed by both Thai and foreign experts in Thai political and security affairs. She suggested that the military address the concerns raised in the book through a formal written response or public debate, to promote open dialogue and transparency, rather than a ban. The Bangkok Post agreed, also citing the Prime Minister, and calling it censorship: 'Ms Paetongtarn, as head of the ISOC, has remained silent on the matter. Her silence clearly implies her approval of censorship, which, while unacceptable, is not surprising.' Indeed, on August 27, the government passed a draft decree that will allow the authorities to curtail academic freedom in the interests of what it calls 'ethics.' Under the controversial decree, a panel is charged with examining all research proposals 'to ensure that they do not violate ethical rules relating to religions, cultures, beliefs, traditions and societal norms.' 'It is baffling how Pheu Thai, which bills itself as a ‘progressive’ party, and Ms Paetongtarn can support censorship, as in the case of the ISOC and the decree,' the Bangkok Post observes. Infiltrating Society In 'Infiltrating Society: The Thai Military's Internal Security Affairs,' Puangthong Pawakapan argues that the Thai military has used infiltration tactics to indoctrinate Thai citizens into accepting military ideologies and securing their preferred political order. Puangthong begins by discussing the Thai military’s most important function. She argues that since the Thai military was modernized by King Rama V, the military has little experience in fighting interstate wars, but has plenty of experience in oppressing its own citizens. Historically, the military has used armed repression to suppress civilian resistance, whether it was millennial rebels during the reign of King Rama V, Muslims in the Deep South, or the Communist Party of Thailand during the Cold War. As Puangthong Pawakapan points out in this book, the bureaucracy of internal security is always present on a routine basis, whether Thailand is under military rule or not. By the word 'infiltration,' Puangthong does not mean only that soldiers disguise themselves and spend time or spy on civilians. Infiltration includes any military project that contributes to the expansion of the political domain into civilian society. The Thai military has devised various ways to do this: village development projects, community and mass organizations, military scholarships, and paramilitary intelligence services. Puangthong points out that cases where the military resorts to violence as a last resort, such as the Thammasat University massacre of 1976, the 2010 crackdown on Red Shirts, and perhaps the People's Party Movement today, all demonstrate that infiltration cannot win the hearts and minds of Thai citizens. Most academic readers of the English-language version consider the book an important contribution. Although several other analyses are already available (see e.g. here and here ), a more holistic approach was needed. According to Pasit Wongngamdee, 'Infiltrating Society is that missing work. The book illustrates how deeply the military has infiltrated civil society and the impact on civil-military relations in Thailand.' The US was never far away According to Sinae Hyun of the Korean Institute for East Asian Studies, Sogang University, the main arguments of Infiltrating Society about the role of the Thai military during the counterinsurgency (1960s-1980s) and the post-insurgency period (1980s to present) can be summarized in three thematic statements. (1) The US-led anticommunist counterinsurgency projects during the Cold War modernized and expanded the role of the military in Thai politics and society, and gave the monarchy the role of political legitimator, allowing the military to continue to play the role of security force and leader of socio-economic development in the post-Cold War period (Chapter 2). (2) At every turning point in Thai political history, the military has acted as protector of the nation and has been involved in socio-economic development projects and the spread of Thai democracy, with the monarch acting as head of state (Chapter 3). (3) Despite many attempts by the military to authoritarianize Thai civil society, the latter continued to harbor a deep distrust of the Thai military. The lack of professionalism in development plans and policies also contributed to this distrust (Chapters 4 and 5). Indoctrination and censorship The examples of infiltration examined in this book are often overlooked in other research. When it comes to state indoctrination channels, the literature tends to focus on media and education. However, the Thai military’s infiltration is often highly covert. It extends into rural and border areas far from the spotlight. Sometimes it is disguised under bureaucratic organizations such as the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. It can also disguise itself under the promotion of religious minority groups, such as Catholics, Muslims, and Sikhs. Thailand’s restrictive political environment encourages self-censorship. Legal sanctions are often imposed for criticizing the government or businesses online. The government has announced that it monitors social media to control political expression. 'The Thai judiciary is independent under the constitution, but in practice the courts suffer from politicization and corruption and often fail to protect freedom of expression,' according to Freedom House. Censorship in Thailand operates through a combination of government and non-government mechanisms, which together shape the landscape of freedom of expression, or the lack thereof. Central to these efforts is the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES), which is responsible for policing digital spaces and implementing policies that restrict access to certain online content deemed harmful to public order or national security. The MDES uses various tools, such as web filtering and content removal, to control online information deemed inappropriate. This broad authority allows the government to maintain significant influence over digital discourse in the country. Add to this a variety of regulatory bodies for media regulation and censorship. The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) plays a crucial role in supervising broadcast media, and the Press Council of Thailand and the National Press Institute engage in self-regulation among journalists and media organizations, often influencing standards of reporting and expression within the industry. The combination of state and non-state actors creates an extensive censorship framework that limits the rights of individuals to express themselves freely. Thus: a complex interplay between legal frameworks, societal norms, and political dynamics Thailand’s landscape of freedom of expression and censorship laws stands in stark contrast to the approaches taken by several other countries, both in Southeast Asia and beyond. Thailand is characterised by a complex interplay between legal frameworks, societal norms, and political dynamics. Historically, the country has struggled with strict censorship laws that have affected both traditional and digital media platforms. Recent developments, however, have indicated a gradual shift in public discourse and a growing demand for greater openness and tolerance of diverse viewpoints. Yet, the future of freedom of expression regulation remains uncertain. Ongoing political reforms could potentially pave the way for greater respect for individual rights and the liberalisation of freedom of expression. However, this depends on the authorities’ willingness to amend existing laws that currently prioritise stability over open dialogue. Therefore, the general Thai public has become increasingly aware of the importance of freedom of expression in promoting a democratic society.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP1qy-bgTdmU8	2025-02-14T18:21:22-08:00	
AMAN 2025: Pakistan’s Naval Diplomacy Or China’s Strategic Chess ...	As the Pakistan-led AMAN 2025 multinational naval exercise concluded this week in the Arabian Sea, its significance extends far beyond the official narrative of 'Together for Peace.' While the exercise brought together over 60 participating nations, including the United States, China, and Bangladesh, its deeper geopolitical ramifications highlights China’s growing influence in South Asia’s maritime security architecture. At first glance, AMAN appears to be a multilateral confidence-building initiative, fostering international naval cooperation. However, the increasing dominance of China within the exercise, coupled with Pakistan’s economic and military dependence on Beijing, raises pressing questions about AMAN’s true strategic intent. Rather than serving as a neutral forum for maritime collaboration, AMAN 2025 exemplifies how Pakistan is enabling China’s steady encroachment into the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). AMAN’s Evolution: From Maritime Cooperation to Strategic Instrument The AMAN series, first launched in 2007, was initially conceived as a platform to address maritime security challenges, anti-piracy operations, and humanitarian assistance coordination. Over time, however, the exercise has evolved into a geopolitical tool that reflects Pakistan’s shifting alliances and growing dependence on China. This year’s exercise witnessed the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) making its strongest showing yet, sending a naval formation including the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the Type 903A replenishment ship Gaoyouhu. Pakistan’s Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, personally visited the Chinese warship, reinforcing the symbolism of deepening China-Pakistan naval cooperation. While Pakistan portrays AMAN as an inclusive platform, highlighting the participation of NATO members such as the United States and Turkey, the reality is more complex. The increasing presence of the PLAN in AMAN exercises demonstrates Beijing’s ability to institutionalize its role in South Asian naval affairs under the pretense of regional cooperation. In AMAN 2025, PLAN fielded one of the largest contingents, second only to Pakistan, signaling China’s determination to integrate itself into regional security mechanisms. Pakistan’s Maritime Dependence on China Pakistan’s financial and military reliance on China has grown dramatically in recent years, with Beijing serving as Islamabad’s largest arms supplier and principal economic backer through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Over 75% of Pakistan's defence imports between 2018 and 2022 came from China, including advanced warships, submarines, and missile systems. Chinese-built warships dominate Pakistan’s navy, including the Type 054A/P frigates and Hangor-class submarines, which significantly enhance Pakistan’s naval capabilities while fostering greater PLAN-Pakistan Navy interoperability. The recent induction of Chinese-made J-10C fighters into Pakistan’s Air Force further underscores the growing military dependence on Beijing. Gwadar Port, a flagship project under CPEC, is quietly transforming into a strategic outpost for Chinese maritime operations, offering Beijing a foothold in the Arabian Sea. With over $62 billion invested in CPEC projects, China has effectively locked Pakistan into a long-term strategic partnership that extends beyond infrastructure and into military cooperation. Pakistan’s economic crisis has further tightened Beijing’s grip, forcing Islamabad to accommodate China’s strategic ambitions in the Indian Ocean in return for financial lifelines. By serving as a willing host for China’s naval expansion in AMAN 2025, Pakistan effectively cements its status as Beijing’s key partner in counterbalancing India’s regional influence. Strategic Implications for India and the Indo-Pacific For India, the growing China-Pakistan maritime nexus poses a direct challenge to its strategic position in the IOR. While New Delhi has traditionally dominated South Asian waters, China’s systematic expansion through AMAN exercises, naval bases in Djibouti, Hambantota, and Gwadar, and regular submarine deployments in the IOR signals a shift in regional power dynamics. The participation of Bangladesh’s BNS Samudra Joy in AMAN 2025 is particularly significant. This marks the first time in over a decade that Dhaka has sent a major warship to a Pakistan-hosted naval exercise. Given China’s role as Bangladesh’s largest defense supplier, accounting for nearly 74% of Dhaka’s arms imports, Bangladesh’s involvement in AMAN signals a growing tilt towards Beijing’s regional security architecture. Bangladesh’s decision to join the exercise raises concerns about China’s long-term influence over smaller South Asian navies, potentially drawing them into Beijing’s strategic orbit at India’s expense. For the broader Indo-Pacific, AMAN 2025 exposes the limitations of the U.S. and its allies in countering China’s soft power in multilateral naval diplomacy. While the U.S. Navy participated in the exercise, Washington risks legitimizing China’s growing influence by engaging in events that subtly reinforce Beijing’s leadership in regional security frameworks. China’s Long-Term Maritime Strategy in the IOR AMAN 2025 is not an isolated event; it fits within China’s broader strategy of establishing a permanent maritime presence in the IOR, where it has historically had limited operational reach. Since 2008, China has steadily expanded its presence in the Indian Ocean under the pretext of anti-piracy operations. Djibouti, Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port, and Pakistan’s Gwadar Port provide Beijing with a 'String of Pearls' for logistical support and power projection. PLAN submarines have made periodic appearances in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, signaling an intent to challenge India’s maritime dominance. A lesser-known but significant aspect of China’s strategy is its seabed mapping operations in the Indian Ocean. Over the past decade, China has deployed multiple research vessels, such as Xiangyanghong 06 and Shiyan 6, to conduct detailed hydrographic surveys. These surveys, conducted under the pretext of scientific research, are crucial for China’s submarine operations, as they help map underwater topography, identify potential submarine routes, and enhance PLAN’s anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The Xiangyanghong series vessels alone have conducted over several missions in the Indian Ocean, including unexplained surveys near India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands. By embedding itself into Pakistan-led naval initiatives, China is creating a low-cost, high-impact mechanism to integrate South Asian navies into its sphere of influence while using exercises like AMAN to familiarize itself with regional waters and potential conflict zones. What’s Next? As AMAN 2025 concludes, its legacy is less about maritime security and more about China’s strategic maneuvering in South Asia. While Pakistan continues to project the exercise as a symbol of inclusive naval diplomacy, it is increasingly clear that Beijing is the real winner. By leveraging Pakistan’s economic and military dependence, China has successfully expanded its footprint in the IOR under the guise of multilateral naval cooperation. For India, the challenge is no longer just about countering China’s presence in the South China Sea but about confronting an assertive Chinese naval presence in the Indian Ocean. The broader Indo-Pacific, including the U.S. and its allies, must recognize that China’s engagement in AMAN is not merely symbolic but part of a long-term strategy to reshape South Asia’s maritime order. AMAN 2025 serves as a stark reminder that China is no longer just a distant maritime power; it is now a direct actor in shaping South Asia’s naval future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP9OquzvuSidQ	2025-02-14T18:20:32-08:00	
The Second Matrix: Break The Controlled Awakening – OpEd	Beyond the First Veil In ‘Reading Between the Lies,’ we explored how to recognize patterns of institutional deception—the carefully crafted narratives that keep humanity trapped in a matrix of perceptions. Theodore Dalrymple identified how this first matrix of control operates in totalitarian regimes: 'In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.' This principle of forced participation hasn’t disappeared—it has evolved. Today’s system doesn’t merely demand silence but active complicity in its narratives, weaponizing resistance itself as a means of influence. Watching trusted voices expose real corruption, only to redirect into managed solutions, reveals an even deeper pattern: The system doesn’t just create propaganda—it creates contained paths for those who see through propaganda. Breaking free from mainstream programming is only the first step. What follows is both subtler and just as disturbing. Untethering from institutional narratives creates an immediate vulnerability—the need for new answers, new leaders, new direction. Those who steer the first matrix wouldn’t leave the off-ramps unsupervised. This illuminates the deeper mechanics of the second matrix: capturing awakening through sophisticated channels of inauthentic opposition. The Mechanics of Controlled Opposition The pattern becomes clear when we examine how systemic criticism is managed: Those who expose corruption are permitted to speak, but only within careful boundaries. Take banking for instance—even those who reveal central banking’s predatory nature rarely demand abolition. The 2008 crisis pushed financial fraud into mainstream awareness through popular exposés like The Big Short. Yet understanding bred only mistrust—no accountability, just bailouts for perpetrators and a more fragile system for everyone else. Like any sophisticated confidence game, it works in stages: first gain trust through real revelations, then build dependency through exclusive 'insider' knowledge, finally redirect that trust toward constrained outcomes. Watch how alternative media platforms follow this pattern: expose genuine corruption, build a devoted following, and then subtly shift narrative focus away from systemic accountability. Each revelation seems to lead deeper into a labyrinth of coordinated awakening. Note: I’m deliberately avoiding naming specific targets—this analysis isn’t about creating new heroes or villains, but recognizing patterns that transcend individuals. What makes this model so effective is that the same institutions that transformed money from gold to paper also convert genuine resistance into managed opposition. As I wrote in ‘Fiat Everything,’ just as synthetic currency replaces real value, fiat opposition movements offer synthetic versions of independent awakening—containing just enough truth to feel real while keeping opposition within safe boundaries. Understanding these patterns of controlled opposition can feel overwhelming. Each revelation seems to lead to another layer of deception. It’s like discovering you’re in a maze only to realize there are mazes within mazes. Some get lost documenting every turn—debating financial system minutiae, arguing over medical protocols, dissecting geopolitical chess moves. Or in ‘conspiracy circles’—was the virus isolated? How did the Towers really go down? What’s really on Antarctica? While these questions matter, getting stuck in endless maze-mapping misses the point entirely. Healthy debate and disagreement are natural, and even healthy, in truth-seeking movements, but when these debates consume all energy and attention, they prevent effective action toward core goals. The Research Journey For the last few years, I’ve been deeply immersed in uncovering the mechanisms of control—not as an abstract exercise, but alongside a team that includes some of my closest friends, following trails that seemed to lead to truth. The revelations have been staggering—fundamental ‘facts’ we grew up accepting have been exposed as complete fabrications. We’ve been humbled twice over—first in unlearning what we thought we knew, then in discovering our own certainties about new paths were wrong. Paths that appeared revolutionary led to sophisticated dead ends. Communities that felt authentic revealed themselves as engineered channels. The hardest truth isn’t just recognizing deception—it’s accepting that we might never know the full story while still needing to act on what we can verify. What began as research into specific deceptions revealed something far more profound: While devastating physical wars rage in multiple regions, a deeper conflict unfolds silently across the planet—a war for the freedom of human consciousness itself. This is what World War III looks like—not just bombs and bullets, but the systematic engineering of human perception. This pattern of building trust before redirection reflects a deeper system of control, operating on the ancient alchemical principle of Solve et Coagula—first dissolve (break apart), then coagulate (reform under control). The process is precise: When people begin recognizing institutional deception, natural coalitions form across traditional divides. Workers unite against central bank policies. Parents organize against pharmaceutical mandates. Communities resist corporate land grabs. But watch what happens next—these unified movements get systematically dissolved. Consider how quickly unified resistance fractured after October 7th, how the trucker protests dissolved into partisan narratives. Each fragment splinters further—from questioning authority to competing theories, from united action to tribal infighting. This isn’t random fragmentation; it’s calculated dissolution. Once broken apart, these fragments can be reformed (coagulated) into controlled dialectical channels, as people revert to prior programming about issues that supersede their unity. Watch how the confidence game operates in truth movements: First comes legitimate revelation—real documents, genuine whistleblowers, undeniable evidence. Trust builds through authentic insight. Then subtle redirection begins. Just as they slice society into ever-smaller fragments along political, racial, and cultural lines, they splinter truth movements into competing camps. Unity becomes division. Action becomes debate. Resistance becomes content. This systematic fragmentation of awakening movements reflects a deeper historical pattern—one that traces the evolution of mass perception control from crude propaganda to sophisticated biodigital manipulation. From Propaganda to Programming The first matrix-shaped thoughts through direct programming. The path from Bernays to biodigital oversight follows a clear progression: first manipulate mass psychology, then digitize behavior, finally merge with biology itself. Each phase builds on the previous—from studying human nature, to tracking it, to directly engineering it. From Bernays discovering how to manipulate mass psychology through unconscious desires, to Tavistock refining social engineering, to algorithmic behavior modification—each phase brings more sophisticated tools for reality manipulation. Digital technology accelerated this evolution: social media algorithms perfect attention capture, smartphones enable constant behavioral monitoring, AI systems predict and shape responses. Now, as these digital tools merge with biological interventions—from mood-altering pharmaceuticals to brain-computer interfaces—they approach complete governance over human perception itself. What began with crude propaganda evolved into precise digital manipulation of attention and behavior. The second matrix creates approved channels for those who break free—an engineered ecosystem of controlled alternatives. Just as coordinated media narratives trained the professional class to outsource their thinking to ‘authoritative sources,’ the biodigital matrix now offers to outsource their sensibility itself—promising enhanced cognition while delivering deeper programming. This represents the latest evolution in perception management: At first, they simply denied conspiracies existed. When that became impossible due to undeniable evidence, they created orchestrated channels for awakening minds to follow. The OJ Simpson trial marked a crucial shift in this strategy—it trained society to process serious investigations as entertainment spectacle. As Marshall McLuhan famously observed, ‘the medium is the message‘—the format of spectacular media entertainment itself reshapes how we process truth, regardless of content. What began as legitimate questions about police corruption and institutional bias became a ratings-driven soap opera. The same pattern continues today—Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes become Netflix entertainment while his clients remain free, and the alleged Mangione shooting spawns multiple streaming productions within days of the event, even before the investigation concludes. The Las Vegas and New Orleans incidents last week offer a stark demonstration: within hours, potentially disruptive events are channeled into competing narratives, while the entertainment apparatus stands ready to transform any serious investigation into consumable content. Real revelations about trafficking networks and institutional crime have become binge-worthy content. Whistleblowers become influencers. Declassified documents become TikTok trends. With limited attention spans and infinite content, truth-seeking becomes another form of consumption that pacifies rather than empowers. Watch how enough time passes and ‘conspiracy theories’ become limited hangouts—JFK’s death gets attributed to ‘the mob,’ a convenient decoy from the institutional forces behind it. Similar patterns emerge with 9/11 revelations. Here’s my position—extreme as it may seem to my friends still steeped in conventional narratives: we have to consider the possibility that the power structure controls both sides of most major debates. Every mainstream narrative has its approved opposition. Every awakening gets its sanctioned leaders. Every revelation leads to administered channels. Understanding this pattern could lead to paralysis—but it shouldn’t. Instead, it means recognizing we need new ways of thinking and organizing entirely. As researcher Whitney Webb observed on X the other day: Screenshot Only the designated enemy changes—the push for greater surveillance and oversight remains constant. Each ‘side’ gets its turn feeding fear to its base while the same institutions expand their power. Nixon opens China. Clinton pushed NAFTA. Trump accelerates Operation Warp Speed. I’m observing a pattern here—not alleging conspiracy, but noting how political figures often act contrary to their public personas: Nixon, the anti-communist, opens the door to China; Clinton, who campaigned on protecting American workers, pushes through the biggest free trade agreement; Trump, the populist outsider, advances Big Pharma’s agenda. Whether through institutional pressures, political realities, or other forces, these contradictions reveal a sophisticated pattern: the system scripts both sides of major political transformations, ensuring controlled outcomes regardless of who appears to hold power. Many of these figures may themselves be responding to forces they barely understand—useful or manipulated actors rather than conscious orchestrators. This dynamic isn’t limited to politicians. Consider Twitter/X, which has spent the last couple of years branding itself as a bastion of free speech while just this week introducing algorithms to amplify ‘positivity.’ Framed as promoting constructive dialogue, it mirrors the same subjective moderation policies once criticized as censorship. This pattern of controlled opposition extends through every level of awakening movements. Consider how many of my friends still caught in the first matrix dismiss QAnon followers as complete fools, mocking them as cartoon characters while ignoring the documented institutional corruption the movement has exposed. What they don’t understand is that beneath the theatrical elements lie significant evidence of systemic criminality. I remain open-minded about examining these claims—after all, pattern recognition requires considering evidence without prejudice. But the movement’s core message of ‘trust the plan’ reveals how awakening gets redirected. It transforms active resistance into passive spectatorship, waiting for hidden ‘white hats’ to save them instead of taking meaningful action. This is where I draw the line. I can’t outsource my family’s well-being to unknown entities or secret plans. This requires constant vigilance—alert to both obvious threats and subtle misdirection. The most dangerous aspect of managed opposition isn’t the information it shares, but how it teaches learned helplessness disguised as hope. The Capture of Authentic Movements Each new theory and movement adds another layer of complexity, drawing seekers further from meaningful action. The 1960s counterculture went from questioning war and authority to ‘tune in, drop out’ passivity. By the 1980s, former hippies became yuppies, their revolutionary awareness neatly channeled into consumer capitalism. Even today, the anti-war movement shows this pattern—one political side opposes war in Ukraine while supporting it in Gaza, the other reverses these positions. Each side claims to be anti-war when it’s not their preferred conflict. Occupy Wall Street followed the same pattern: beginning with potent exposure of financial corruption, it fragmented into competing social justice causes that left the banking system untouched. The seduction lies in the truth content. Environmental movements expose corporate pollution but push carbon credits and individual guilt. Social justice movements expose real inequities but redirect into corporate DEI programs. The organic food revolution began as resistance to industrial agriculture but became a premium product category—redirecting real concerns into boutique shopping choices. Each movement contains enough truth to attract awakened minds while setting careful guardrails on acceptable solutions—identifying real problems but advocating solutions that expand institutional power. This pattern repeats at every level. Throughout history, power structures have understood the principle of supplying controlled leadership to emerging movements. This pattern continues today across every awakening movement. The template is consistent: A politician 'bravely' questions vaccines while taking pharma money A pundit 'exposes' deep state corruption while defending intelligence agencies A celebrity 'fights cancel culture' while pushing digital passports A financial guru 'warns' about banking collapse while selling CBDCs These patterns of redirection play out vividly today. The medical freedom movement demonstrates this dynamic: Valid concerns about vaccine injuries risk getting redirected into competing theories and circular debates, while accountability remains elusive. The recent MAHA controversy shows how even valid food sovereignty concerns can potentially redirect focus from this urgent crisis of vaccine injuries and accountability. The crypto world illustrates this pattern: Valid criticism of central banking transforms into tribal warfare between token communities. Each claims exclusive truth while potentially extending the system’s reach. Even reasonable debates about monetary solutions become religious devotion to competing coins. Meanwhile, the original promise of Bitcoin—the first cryptocurrency and its vision of financial autonomy—risks getting co-opted, as blockchain technology is repurposed for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), digital IDs, and automated compliance. The very tools meant to free us from banking surveillance are being repurposed to perfect it. But the fusion of financial control with digital identity creates something far more insidious—a system that can enforce social compliance through access to basic resources, monitor thoughts through transaction patterns, and ultimately merge with our biological existence itself. This architecture isn’t just about controlling money—it’s about programming minds. The Biodigital Convergence: Engineering Human Reality The fusion of digital and biological control isn’t just changing how we interact—it’s redesigning human perception itself. As social connections move increasingly online, authentic human awareness is being systematically replaced with engineered experiences. Beyond attention hijacking and emotional manipulation, the deepest cost hits us where it hurts most—in our human connections. Every day we see people together physically but separated by screens, missing moments of genuine connection while scrolling through manufactured realities. This artificial construct is set to deepen further—Meta has announced plans to populate Facebook feeds with AI-generated content and bot interactions by 2025, raising questions about authentic human connection on these platforms. Big Pharma brought the ability to chemically alter cognizance; Big Tech perfected the ability to digitally direct attention and shape behavior. Their merger isn’t about market share—it’s about complete spectrum dominance over human cognition itself. The same companies that pushed pills to numb a generation now partner with platforms that addict us to digital stimulation. The corporations that profited from ADHD medication collaborate with social media giants that deliberately engineer attention deficit. The entities that market antidepressants join forces with algorithm makers who scientifically manipulate emotional responses. As Whitney Webb observed about the shifting enemy narrative from ‘Russians’ to ‘Islamists,’ the designated threat changes while surveillance expansion remains constant. The digital ID agenda follows this pattern: while the World Economic Forum presents it as humanitarian aid for financial inclusion, it builds the architecture for comprehensive behavioral monitoring and oversight. Each crisis—whether health, security, or financial—adds new requirements that merge identity, banking, health records, and social tracking into a single unified system. What begins as voluntary participation inevitably becomes mandatory as digital surveillance extends into monitoring and shaping human behavior itself—the perfect staging ground for Central Bank Digital Currency. This surveillance architecture represents the merging of two foundational pillars. What began with chemical alterations of mood and thought, then evolved into digital manipulation of attention and behavior, is now fusing into a single architecture for human experiential management. Watch how mental health apps collect behavioral data while promoting medication. Social credit scoring merges with health tracking. The same companies developing digital identity systems partner with pharmaceutical giants. This isn’t future speculation—it’s happening now. While we debate the ethics of AI, they’re quietly building the infrastructure to merge human cognition with digital systems. The transhumanist promise of enhanced awareness through technology masks a darker reality—each integration diminishes natural human perception, replacing genuine consciousness with an engineered simulation. This technological colonization of the human brain seeks to sever our connection to natural awareness and spiritual sovereignty. In one of his later lectures, Aldous Huxley, the renowned author of Brave New World, offered a chilling prediction about the future of social control: 'There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it.' We’re at a crucial juncture where technological capture of human consciousness is becoming irreversible. Each new generation is born into deeper digital integration, their baseline reality increasingly synthetic. But recognizing this pattern reveals both the threat and its weakness. While they perfect technological tools for control, they can’t fully replicate the power of direct human connection. Every instance of genuine interaction, every moment of unmediated presence, demonstrates what their system can’t capture. The answer isn’t just seeing through lies—it’s creating spaces of human connection that exist outside their control architecture. What makes this moment unprecedented isn’t just the sophistication of control, but its method of implementation—not through force, but through seduction and convenience. Each convenience we embrace, each digital enhancement we accept, brings us closer to their vision of managed awareness. Liberating Consciousness, Reclaiming Connection Understanding these mechanisms doesn’t mean rejecting technology or retreating into paranoid isolation—it means recognizing that real power begins with autonomy and learning to engage with modernity on our own terms. The battle for our minds requires both awareness and authentic action. While they attempt to engineer behavior through chemicals and algorithms, our power lies first in liberating ourselves, then extending through direct human connection. Their endgame—absolute mastery over human perception and cognition—reveals a fundamental weakness: they cannot fully contain liberated minds and authentic human relationships that exist outside their mediated channels. This comprehensive system requires managed opposition at every level, steering us away from genuine awakening and direct engagement. The crucial insight is this: The opposite of globalism isn’t nationalism or political movements—it’s individual liberty expressed through local action. Real awakening can’t be programmed or scheduled. It emerges through clear recognition and spreads through genuine connection. When intellectuals at think tanks like Brownstone Institute found common cause with firefighters, the system recognized a dangerous precedent. Unity across traditional societal divides—between intellectuals, professionals, and working people—demonstrates how truly free people can bridge manufactured divisions. While digital networks can facilitate organization, true power manifests in physical community. Speaking from experience, these digital networks have been invaluable in my journey—I’ve found kindred spirits, shared insights, and built lasting friendships through online communities. These connections have helped me understand patterns I might never have seen alone. But information sharing is just the first step. The real transformation happens when we take these shared insights off the screen and into our communities, turning digital connections into flesh-and-blood relationships and shared local action. This means: Freeing our minds while they push programmed thinking (creating local learning circles to counter their digital-pharmaceutical engineering of thought) Building connections while maintaining individual agency (establishing real communities to resist their social credit systems) Taking action without waiting for consensus (bypassing their arranged opposition channels) Growing food while they push synthetic alternatives (maintaining biological autonomy as they push lab-created dependencies) Building community while they sell digital tribes (creating genuine connection as antidote to technological isolation) Healing ourselves while they market dependencies (developing natural resilience against their biodigital convergence) The most powerful truth isn’t a revelation—it’s the recognition that consciousness can transcend its constructed boundaries entirely. The way out requires stepping beyond their endless distractions and reclaiming grounded, authentic action. Their biodigital convergence can only capture souls that follow their prescribed paths. Our essence was never truly bound by their walls. ​​Stay vigilant. Question everything. Free your mind and act with intention. The revolution begins with sovereign spirits and grows through genuine connection. Build where they destroy. Create while they deceive. Connect while they divide.

Neighboring Countries Should Be The Focus Of China’s Diplomacy – ...	By Zhou Chao For a long time, relations with the United States have always been a top priority in China's diplomatic work. Relevant experts in the field have repeatedly pointed out that maintaining stable development of U.S.-China relations is one of the most important elements in China's diplomatic strategy. Previously, China actively proposed building a new type of major-power relationship, reflecting its expectations for the development of the relations. According to the essence of this new type of major-power relationship, i.e., 'no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation', China focuses on three main aspects in developing relations with the U.S.: First, strengthening strategic mutual trust, effectively managing differences, and ensuring no conflict and no confrontation; Second, enhancing exchanges at all levels to promote mutual respect between the two countries; Third, advancing pragmatic cooperation in various fields to continue achieving mutual benefits. China has consistently emphasized that the focus of its policy toward the U.S. should be on strengthening strategic mutual trust and effectively managing differences. There is no doubt that the easing of U.S.-China relations and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries have been important external factors for the smooth advancement of China's reform and opening-up efforts. With the support and recognition of the U.S. within certain limits, the global economic-technical-financial network controlled by the U.S. and the West eventually accepted China's integration. Additionally, significant capital investment and technology transfer from the U.S. and the West have been crucial driving forces behind China's rise in economy and technology. It is also indisputable that in recent years, the deepening of the negative aspects of U.S.-China relations has been a major reason for the deterioration of China's relations with the U.S. and the West. A series of actions taken by the U.S. has significantly challenged China's interests in many third-world countries, with Panama recently officially announcing its full withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It seems that the only way to effectively resolve the series of challenges China is facing at present is to continue to make every effort to improve diplomatic relations with the U.S. However, a senior researcher at ANBOUND pointed out that, in order to effectively safeguard China's overseas interests and global position, neighboring countries should become the key focus of China's diplomatic efforts in the future, at least within the next 3 to 5 years. First, making every effort to deepen and optimize diplomatic relations with neighboring countries is an objective requirement in the era of de-globalization. Up until now, globalization driven by capital, which has overly focused on the economic aspect, has shown a series of problems and signs of fatigue. Economically, the comprehensive expansion of globalization in the past has not fulfilled its earlier promise of universal prosperity. The gap between rich and poor, both between nations and within nations, continues to widen, triggering global dissatisfaction. On the social and cultural level, the full promotion of globalization has not effectively bridged the gaps in culture and ideology. The degree of opposition between different cultures and ideologies has even intensified, while the wave of migration caused by past globalization has sparked strong discontent from the dominant national groups, even in developed countries, leading to the rise of right-wing populist forces. Moreover, the lengthening of global industrial and value chains has made the international economic system highly vulnerable when faced with major pandemics, natural disasters, or regional conflicts. ANBOUND has already emphasized that regionalization will be the dominant trend in the future, with major powers gradually shifting their development focus to their geographically adjacent regions. After Donald Trump took office, he repeatedly requested Denmark to cede Greenland and asked Canada to join the U.S., which were not just mere jokes. Second, the latest series of developments in China's neighboring countries indicate that its interests in these nations are increasingly facing urgent and direct threats. As a key area of interest for China's BRI, namely the security situation in Pakistan has become more turbulent. The actions of separatist and terrorist forces are growing in strength and their destructive power is escalating, along with a deepening of anti-China sentiment. The Pakistani authorities, constrained by their own capabilities and internal political struggles, face challenges to respond, and the performance of the Gwadar Port project has also been unsatisfactory. In Myanmar, the conflict between local armed groups and the military government is intensifying, and China's interests in this Southeast Asian country are facing increasingly severe threats. In Cambodia, the future of the major canal project, previously agreed upon with China's heavy investment, remains uncertain. U.S. and Japanese capitals are likely to replace Chinese investment, and Cambodia-China relations face more unpredictability. In the South China Sea, regarding disputes over islands and reefs, the Philippines has become increasingly adamant in its stance against China, and Vietnam has not fully reversed its confrontational position toward China. The South Sea issue could further escalate at any time. In northern China, factors such as terrorism and social unrest in Central Asia continue to pose significant threats to China's interests. Recently, Russia has implemented strict screening of goods along the China-Europe Railway, citing the need to 'prevent sensitive materials from transiting'. The focus is on inspecting dual-use military and civilian items and sensitive goods, while also seizing various civilian essential goods, hindering normal trade between China and Europe. Additionally, there are reports that Russia plans to build a bridge over the Tumen River, directly connecting to North Korea, but the height of the bridge will effectively block the potential for Chinese vessels to pass through the Tumen River to the sea. Although further verification is needed, considering Russia's long-standing obstruction of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project and attempts to form a natural gas export alliance with Central Asian countries to influence gas exports to China, this development should not be underestimated. All in all, due to the complex geopolitical and ideological factors, the surrounding regions, which are critical to China's development and home to many significant projects, are increasingly facing risks and challenges that require more attention from China. Third, the relative withdrawal of the U.S. attention in the region provides China with a window of opportunity to strengthen its influence over regional situations. Both Trump's victory speech and his actions after taking office indicate that domestic issues will be the primary focus of the U.S. government. Recently, Trump's proposal to offer civil servants a 'buyout' of their years of service has faced joint resistance from legislative bodies across multiple regions, and the long-standing establishment of the U.S. government suggests that Trump's efforts to reorganize the government will not be smooth. As a result, the U.S. government's foreign attention and resources are likely to be adjusted or even reduced, with its focus shifting more toward matters in the Americas. When it comes to China's surrounding situations, the U.S. is likely to adopt a more opportunistic approach, using offshore balancing to exert influence, while its willingness and capacity for direct involvement may decrease. For China, this represents an opportunity that should not be overlooked. Final analysis conclusion: One important point to recognize is that the complexity of the surrounding situation China faces is far greater than that of the U.S. At the same time, neighboring countries concentrate a large portion of China's major interests, yet its relations with these countries are facing increasingly severe challenges. As the U.S. tends to further retract, China should, at least in the next 3 to 5 years, devote more attention to its diplomacy with neighboring countries, dedicating time and effort to address and resolve the series of issues in the surrounding situation.

Trump And Modi Meet Half Way To Put Indo-US Relations On An Even ...	In the larger interest of Indo-American relations, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed willingness to adjust India's policies to enable President Donald Trump to carry out his plan to get America a fair deal in international trade and revitalise its economy. US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Washington on Thursday to iron out differences in the larger interest of Indo-American relations. Strong Indo-US relations area a critical necessity for both India and the US given their adversarial relations with the common challenger China. The optics at the White House parleys were excellent. The two leaders shook hands and hugged each other before they addressed the international press at the White House immediately before holding bilateral talks. 'I appreciate how President Trump always keeps his country first. I do the same - that is something that we have in common,' Modi said. And complementing Modi, Trump said: 'He is doing a great job in India and he and I share a great friendship. We will continue to build on ties between our nations.' Trump emphasized that US and India have a 'great friendship' and added that he thought that 'it's only going to get closer'. The fact that Modi's party the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had swept the Delhi elections only a few days before, would have enhanced his profile in the Trump camp and boost his efforts to 'deepen the India-US partnership' in key areas such as technology, trade, defence and energy as sought by Modi. Trump offered to sell state-of-the-art fighter jets to India as he and Modi vowed to ramp up trade, rekindling a bond that defies the new US administration's punitive approach to much of the world. Trump said that he found a 'special bond' with Modi and India and, in an uncharacteristic, if ironic show of humility, complimented Modi as being a 'much tougher negotiator' than he is. US$ 500 billion Trade Modi said that US and India are targeting US$ 500 billion bilateral trade by 2030. He further said that the US and India would work together on Artificial Intelligence and semiconductors and focus on establishing strong supply chains for strategic minerals. Trump said that he expected 'wonderful trade deals' and noted that India is reforming its laws to welcome US nuclear technologies. Tariff Issue Modi would have to give his nod to a significant hike in American tariffs on imports from India and lower Indian tariffs on US goods coming to India to narrow the significant trade gap now in favour of India. The Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totalled around US$ 190.1 billion in 2023. US exports to India were worth US$70 billion and imports US$120 billion. The US is India's largest trade partner, but the two countries have a trade deficit of US$ 50 billion which is in India's favour. Even as he referred to Modi as a 'great friend,' Trump on Thursday signed increases on tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries, including India, charge on imports. Earlier,Trump had indicated that he was going to be hard on India which he called a 'Tariff King.' He said: 'India is a very hard place to do business because of the tariffs. They have the highest tariffs.' Indeed, among Asian economies, India has a 9.5% weighted average effective tariff on US exports, while there is a 3% rate on India's exports to the US. Thailand has a 6.2% rate and China a 7.1% rate on US products. Trump has already signed a round of what he called 'reciprocal tariffs' to create a level playing field between US manufacturers and foreign competitors. He slapped 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, to boost local production. The 25% tariff applies to India too. India is not a particularly large supplier of steel to the US, but it is one of the world's largest primary producers of aluminium and America is its top export market. India's aluminium exports to the US, therefore, could see a drop. Trade Agreement India has no option but to grin and bear the tariff hikes. One way to cushion itself against the US tariff blows is to enter into a broad trade agreement with the US. India and US are working to finalizing such an agreement by the end of 2025. A trade agreement, appropriately packaged, will enable India to sell to the Indian public the idea of paying high tariffs in the US and charge less on imports from the US. Anticipating Trump's moves, in February, India slashed custom duties on import of American products, such as high-end motorcycles and cars, and smartphone components, in a move that is expected to benefit American corporate giants like Harley-Davidson, Tesla, and Apple. In 2023 itself India had dropped retaliatory tariffs on US almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts. More recently, India allowed US-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India itself, and the sale of US-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. Prior to meeting with Trump, Modi had met Elon Musk, the SpaceX founder and top Trump administration official. It is expected that Musk's Starlink satellite system for transmitting commercial programmes, will be allowed to operate in India. Earlier, India had feared that Starlink might compromise India's security. Adani Case Earlier, in a move that would help Modi and his protégé billionaire businessman Gautam Adani, Trump signed an Executive Order directing the Department of Justice (DoJ) to pause enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) that prohibits American companies and foreign firms from bribing officials of foreign governments to obtain or retain business. Under the Biden administration Gautam Adani and his company were charged for paying with US investors' money, US$ 265 million as bribes to Indian officials to secure solar power contracts. This charge may now be dropped as Trump has paused actions based on FCPA. About FCPA Trump said: 'It sounds good, but it hurts the country.' If FCPA is strictly enforced, US companies may not be able to do business in the Global South. It is widely known that the Biden administration did not favour Modi because of his bonhomie with Russian President Putin. Adani suffered on account of this when he was indicated in a US court for alleged bribery. Trump is now trying to negotiate a deal with Putin to end the war in Ukraine and save money for the US. And Modi has always been calling for an end to the war. This convergence of interest has led to Adani's getting off the hook. To suit Trump, Adani has announced a plan to invest billions in the US. Illegal Immigration Illegal immigration is a key political issue bedevilling Indo-US relations since Trump came to power. The US says that there are 700,000 illegal Indian immigrants in the US. Recently, 104 of them were bound hand and foot, piled into a military aircraft and flown to India. The video footage of these poor Indians spoiled the image of America in Indian eyes. And the Modi government was seen as weak-kneed in its response to the US action. Getting US to take a more humanistic approach to this issue would have been one of the aims of Modi's talks with Trump. But to help Trump, India has already said that it will take back verified citizens of India though it insists that the number of illegals is only about 470. Modi would have made a pitch for maintaining the H-1B visa regime, a cause dear to India's burgeoning middle class. Sections of the US right wing are against these visas. Defence and Geopolitics For the Trump administration, India is an integral to the US strategy of containing China in the Indo-Pacific. India will be hosting a summit of Quad made up of the US, India, Japan and Australia later this year. The US had declared China as the strategic competitor in its Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS-2022) in February 2022, and simultaneously designated India as its strategic partner and counter weight to China. Ever since, India is being granted exceptionalism and preferential treatment to enhance its technological and military potential against China. The USA not only granted unprecedented CAATSA waiver to India for purchasing S-400 from Russia but also facilitated access to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). The US had entered into 123 civil nuclear agreement besides exporting niche military capabilities to India and concluded a number of military agreements including General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA); Logistic Support Agreement (LSA); Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Intelligence (BECA) with India. Modi would like Trump greater substance to these agreements and also see that US products are not prohibitively priced. During the Biden era in 2022, the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) was launched. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it. Modi would have sought assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they would remain committed to this. Blow to Pakistan In a blow to Pakistan, Trump approved Tahawwur Rana's extradition to India. Rana, a Pakistani, had masterminded the Mumbai terrorist attack. 'I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters (Tahawwur Rana) and one of the very evil people of the world, having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India. He is going back to India to face justice,' Trump said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP6RCDuDRJ0Mw	2025-02-14T18:14:09-08:00	
Iran: Power Outages And Economic Paralysis Deepen Crises – OpEd	Power outages and the electricity crisis have exacerbated the suffering of people across Iran, especially as many regions are already paralyzed due to air pollution or struggling with heavy snow, icy roads, and road closures. According to the regime’s media, on Wednesday, February 12, schools, government offices, and banks were closed in Tehran and 25 other provinces. Widespread power outages, despite all the problems they bring, are just a small part of the people’s suffering. The lack of electricity cripples daily life, forcing factories and businesses to shut down, leading to heavy financial losses. A simple example is bakeries, which provide daily bread for people in every city and neighborhood. With power outages, they are unable to serve customers, and even the dough prepared for baking goes to waste. Other businesses, such as metal workshops, carpentry shops, repair centers, and stores, also face similar problems. Instead of making a living, they suffer financial damage. In a video clip from Isfahan on Wednesday, February 12, a local resident says: 'Look at the situation they’ve created for people. I was filming something for a customer, and suddenly the power went out. We were packing an order for a customer, but it’s been an hour now, and the power is still out, leaving our work unfinished. What kind of situation is this? There’s no electricity at home, and there’s no electricity at the workshop either.' Other videos from Tehran also depict powerless neighborhoods and the frustration of residents in the streets. A local woman says: 'The power in my shop has been cut off, and this is my peak working hour. When the electricity goes out, neither our life is a life nor our business is a business. I’m disappointed in this government for failing to provide electricity. How long is this going to continue? How long do we have to live like this? This is our shop and our income, but at the end of the month, we still have to pay for electricity, water, gas, and taxes.' The electricity crisis is a reflection of the overall crisis within the clerical regime, which is struggling in the swamp of its destructive policies and comprehensive failures. Internally, the regime is also in turmoil, plagued by infighting and factional disputes. The ongoing conflict between the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Oil, both responsible for resolving such issues, is a scandal in the cabinet of regime president Masoud Pezeshkian. The Ministry of Oil, blaming the Ministry of Energy, stated in a report, 'While statistics show that proper fuel management could have prevented the recent problems, the Ministry of Energy, instead of focusing on sound policymaking and implementing regulations related to liquid fuel consumption, is attempting to shift the blame by portraying gas shortages as the primary cause of power outages.' Fatemeh Mohajerani, Pezeshkian’s spokesperson, attempted to justify the situation that has frustrated people by making a ridiculous statement: 'As the Tavanir electricity company announced, due to difficulties in supplying power plant fuel, which is rooted in fuel imbalance, we were forced to cut power to some residential areas. This is certainly not desirable for the government, nor are we really happy or satisfied with it, but when we are stuck in difficult conditions, we have to get through it together. We are in a situation where we are forced to do this—meaning that power outages are not our first choice, but given the circumstances, we have no other option.' The reality, however, is that this regime is not the solution to the problem but the root of all problems. This is why the only true solution for the people of Iran is an uprising and the overthrow of this anti-Iranian regime.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP9pYy2wYO37D	2025-02-14T18:12:28-08:00	
Why Europe’s Security Must Be A Key US Aim – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Last week was a busy one in US-European relations. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth made his first official visit to Europe for a NATO meeting in Brussels, Vice President J.D. Vance also made his first visit to deliver a speech on artificial intelligence in Paris — and Americans woke up to the surprising news that an American long held by Russia had been released as part of a prisoner exchange. President Donald Trump also held lengthy phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to jump start Ukraine peace talks between the two countries. These events all led up to the annual Munich Security Conference, beginning on Friday, at which Europeans, Americans, and many from all corners of the world were eager to hear what Vance had to say about the future of US-European ties, NATO, and relations with Russia. This busy week will set the tone for the new Trump administration and its approach to the continent. As Trump develops that approach, he should look back at his first term as a blueprint. What many in Europe remember about that first term was repeated by Vance in his speech in Munich on Friday — criticism of European allies for their inadequate funding of defense and relying too much on the American military presence on the continent. However, the actual policy outcomes differed greatly from the rhetoric. Despite the attacks on Europeans for not spending enough, Trump’s first term in the White House delivered an increase of more than 40 percent in American spending on European defense compared with the Obama administration. By the time Trump left in 2021, there were more US forces in Europe and more training exercises across the continent than before he took office. Trump also took significant steps to strengthen Europe’s energy security and stability. He ramped up US exports of LNG, reducing European reliance on Russian gas. He also imposed sanctions Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which was undermining Europe’s energy security. Trump was the first to provide advanced anti-tank weapons to Ukraine after the Obama administration repeatedly failed to do so. He also oversaw the largest expulsion in history of Russian spies and diplomats from US territory, and closed down two Russian consulates in Seattle and San Francisco along with two trade mission annexes in Washington and New York. These were not the actions of someone indifferent to Europe or weak on Russia. If anything, they demonstrated a strong commitment to European security and US leadership in transatlantic affairs. It is this kind of strategic thinking that should inform the second Trump administration’s approach. One significant change since Trump’s first term is the growing bipartisan awareness of the challenges China poses to US national interests. As a result, many in the Trump administration believe that East Asia should be the focus for national security. However, as a global power in what Secretary of State Marco Rubio describes as a multipolar world, the US cannot afford to focus on one region at the expense of others. Regardless of discussions about reprioritizing Asia and drawing down US forces in Europe and the Middle East, geopolitical reality makes such a shift nearly impossible. Europe remains crucial to the well-being of the American economy. Together, North America and Europe account for about half of the world’s GDP. Two-thirds of all foreign investment into the US is from Europe. Additionally, Europe is collectively America’s largest export market, with 48 out of 50 US states exporting more to the continent than they do to China. Trump, with his background in business, understands better than anyone that when an American product is exported, that secures an American job. Right now, Russia is actively trying to undermine stability in Europe, which threatens the economic prosperity that has long benefited both the US and the American worker. Essentially, America’s military presence in Europe, along with NATO, is the primary security guarantor of America’s largest export market and source of foreign investment. The idea that America could simply walk away from Europe is not only naive but also geopolitically dangerous. If the world is reemerging as a multipolar system, as Rubio suggests, then many of these geopolitical poles are converging in eastern Ukraine, where Russia continues its aggression with the assistance of North Korean soldiers and Iranian drones. The security of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia is interconnected, whether policymakers like it or not. As Trump’s second administration unfolds, maintaining strong transatlantic relations will be essential to ensuring that the US remains an influential player on the world stage. While there will undoubtedly be discussions about shifting priorities, the geopolitical realities of the modern world make it clear that Europe must remain a key pillar of US foreign policy. The administration should take a strategic, long-term approach to strengthening NATO, supporting Ukraine, and maintaining US leadership in European security. Ultimately, the Trump administration’s approach to Europe should not be defined by campaign rhetoric but by practical policy measures that align with US strategic interests. As history has shown, a strong and engaged America in Europe is not just beneficial for the continent — it is also vital for US national security and economic prosperity. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

How Trophic Cascades Devastate Ecosystems And Endanger Human Heal...	Bats and vultures may not be widely loved, but their decline has profound negative implications for humans. All organisms in an ecosystem are interconnected, and any imbalance in this complex relationship can have irreversible consequences for both humans and nonhumans. Numerous examples illustrate how the destruction of one species can lead to unforeseen and devastating impacts on others. 'Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning do matter to human beings. ... And it's not always the charismatic and fuzzy species,' said Eyal Frank, an environmental scientist and economist at the University of Chicago, in a New York Times interview in July 2024. Frank is one of the authors of the study 'The Social Costs of Keystone Species Collapse: Evidence from the Decline of Vultures in India,' published in the American Economic Review in October 2024. Various studies have shown how this lack of natural harmony has affected biodiversity and human health. For instance, the loss of trees in the United States due to the invasive emerald ash borer increased human deaths related to cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, according to a 2013 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. The study, conducted in 15 U.S. states from 1990 to 2007, examined the effects of this imbalance on biodiversity and human health. Another example is the extinction of gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park in the 1920s, which led to an explosion in the elk population. The elks, in turn, devoured the vegetation, triggering a trophic cascade or ecosystem collapse. The loss of prey often forces predators to find new food sources, which can have unpredictable environmental consequences. By definition, trophic collapse must affect a minimum of three feeding levels. Trophic cascades frequently occur during periods of climate stress. 'Our results... suggest that increasing environmental stress... as a result of climate change may decouple species interactions,' noted Brian S. Cheng and Edwin D. Grosholz, environmental scientists at the University of California, Davis, in a 2016 article in Ecosphere. The public pays attention when a species considered 'adorable'—like polar bears, dolphins, or pandas—is threatened with extinction. However, the same risks faced by underappreciated species—such as bats and vultures—are often overlooked, underscoring the threat posed by trophic cascades to the world's ecosystems. The devastation affecting bat populations in the U.S. and vultures in India has largely escaped notice, as neither species inspires much affection. Instead, they often evoke fear and disgust. However, their decline has dire implications for humanity. Healthy Bat Populations Support Human Health 'Bats are a fantastic example of a species that we like to keep a distance from, but that are truly impactful in terms of the role they play in ecosystems,' Frank told the Washington Post in September 2024. He was referring to a study he authored and published in Science that same month. The study documented how biodiversity degradation negatively affects human health. He found that the declining bat population was linked to an 8 percent increase in infant mortality rate in certain U.S. counties. This link is due to the positive impacts of bat's diets. Every night, a single bat consumes up to 40 percent of its body weight in insects. In agricultural areas, this means that when bats disappear, farmers might use more insecticides on their fields,' explained Rudy Molinek, a fellow at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in a September 2024 article in Smithsonian Magazine. According to the study, the decline in the bat population resulted in 1,334 infant deaths between 2006 and 2017. Essentially, the loss of bats, which led to a rise in insect populations, directly impacted human health. In areas with a marked decline in the bat population, U.S. farmers increased their use of insecticides by 31 percent. White-Nose Syndrome The principal culprit behind the bat die-off is white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by a fungus that attacks bats during hibernation. WNS disrupts the hibernation cycle in winter, leading to energy depletion and death. Researchers first identified the disease in 2006 when they observed dying bats in the Northeast U.S. with white fuzz on their noses, ears, and wings. It is believed that the fungus responsible for the syndrome, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, originated in Europe and was transported to the U.S., possibly through cavers traveling between continents. As of November 2024, white-nose syndrome has been confirmed in 40 states and nine Canadian provinces. The disease has wiped out more than 90 percent of three North American bat species. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, 6.7 million bats have died from WNS since 2006. According to State of the Bats: North America, a 2023 report by experts from Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., 52 percent of North American bat species are at 'risk of severe population decline' through at least 2038 due to various factors, including WNS, habitat loss, climate change, and collisions with wind turbines. 'They need our help to survive,' Winifred Frick, chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, one of the groups that participated in the State of the Bats report, told the Associated Press. 'We face a biodiversity crisis globally, and bats play a vital role in healthy ecosystems needed to protect our planet.' The syndrome's mortality rate averages around 70 to 90 percent. 'In some cases, the mortality rate has been 100 percent, wiping out entire colonies,' stated the Center for Biological Diversity. Researchers are still searching for an effective treatment for it. Polyethylene glycol 8000 has shown promise when applied as a spray to coat fungal spores and prevent their spread. Additionally, a vaccine experimentally used in Wisconsin has reduced infections in affected bat populations. 'Fungal disease killed bats, bats stopped eating enough insects, farmers applied more pesticides to maximize profit and keep food plentiful and cheap, the extra pesticide use led to more babies dying,' Eli Fenichel of Yale University told the New York Times in September. 'It is a sobering result.' Frank told the Guardian that during his research, he ruled out all other causes of infant mortality, including 'the opioid epidemic, parental unemployment, genetically modified crops, and even the weather,' Molinek of AAAS reported in Smithsonian Magazine. Frank further stated that the results provide 'compelling evidence... that farmers did respond to the decline in insect-eating bats, and that response had an adverse health impact on human infants.' Vanishing Vultures Cause Human Deaths to Rise in India Bats aren't the only species that benefit humans—a phenomenon some scientists call 'ecosystem services.' In another study co-authored by Frank, he found that '[a]fter vultures nearly went extinct in India, an extra 500,000 people died' on the subcontinent between 2000 and 2005. 'Vultures are considered nature's sanitation service because of their important role in removing dead animals that contain bacteria and pathogens from our environment—without them, the disease can spread,' Frank told the BBC. 'Understanding the role vultures play in human health underscores the importance of protecting wildlife, not just the cute and cuddly,' he added. 'They all have a job to do in our ecosystems that impacts our lives.' The first reports of the vulture die-off came from villagers in northern India. Hindus consider cows sacred and do not eat their meat; instead, they leave the carcasses for vultures to strip and consume. The people then harvest the bones to make bone meal and fertilizer. The villagers' warnings foreshadowed the catastrophe to come. The white-backed vultures, once abundant, are now on the brink of extinction. As they sicken, their long bald necks droop into the shape of nooses; death soon follows. 'By the mid-1990s, the 50 million-strong vulture population had plummeted to near zero because of diclofenac, a cheap non-steroidal painkiller for cattle that is fatal to vultures. Birds that fed on carcasses of livestock treated with the drug suffered from kidney failure and died,' stateda BBC article. According to a New York Times article published in July 2024, vulture populations in India have declined to less than 1 percent of their previous numbers. The disappearance of vultures has not only resulted in the loss of their critical environmental role but has also had severe consequences for human health and mortality. The 'half a million excess human deaths' occurred because rotting livestock carcasses polluted water supplies and contributed to a rise in feral dog populations, which spread waterborne diseases and rabies, according to the New York Times article. 'It was 'a really huge negative sanitation shock,'' said Anant Sudarshan, an economics professor at the University of Warwick in England, who co-authored the study with Frank. Sudarshan and Frank compared human death rates in Indian districts that once had thriving vulture populations to those with historically low vulture numbers, both before and after the vulture collapse. They examined rabies vaccine sales, feral dog populations, and pathogen levels in the water supplies. The researchers revealed that human death rates increased by more than 4 percent in districts where vultures had previously thrived. The effect was most significant in urban areas with large livestock populations, where carcass dumps were common. For years, the cause of the vulture deaths remained a mystery. However, in 2004, researchers identified the culprit: diclofenac, a widely used anti-inflammatory drug. A decade earlier, the steroid's patent had expired, leading to the production of cheaper generic versions that farmers began using extensively. This unintentionally triggered a mass extinction of vultures. In their study published by the American Economic Association, Frank and Sudarshan found a direct correlation between the rise in diclofenac sales and the subsequent collapse of vulture populations. The researchers used range maps to determine where vultures had lived and where they had not, allowing them to draw their conclusions. They discovered that '[i]n districts where vultures had lived, human death rates started ticking up in 1994, the year after the price dropped on diclofenac,' noted the New York Times. Human deaths continued rising over the following years in those districts, in stark contrast to areas where vultures were never present. Alarmed conservationists pushed for a ban on the drug's veterinary use. Although they succeeded in 2006, the 2023 State of India's Birds report revealed that at least three vulture species in India have suffered long-term losses of 91 to 98 percent. In ecological terms, they are now functionally extinct. The decline of both bats and vultures is already disrupting ecosystems and negatively impacting human health. To prevent further devastation, we must take urgent steps to preserve biodiversity and recognize the far-reaching consequences of our actions on other species.

Charles Barkley Calls Out San Francisco – OpEd	This year’s NBA All-Star Game will take place on February 16 at the Chase Center in San Francisco, but NBA hall-of-famer Charles Barkley won’t be attending. As the TNT commentator explained, 'I’m not going to that rat-infested place out in San Francisco,' a city where 'you can’t even walk around down there.' Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors countered, 'Yes, you can walk around.' Barkeley responded, 'Yeah, with a bulletproof vest.' One athlete who might agree with Barkeley is Ricky Pearsall, the San Francisco 49ers’ first-round draft choice. Last August 31, the wide receiver attended an autograph session in downtown San Francisco where a man demanded his watch. Pearsall refused to give it up and in the ensuing struggle, the assailant shot Pearsall in the chest. Incredibly enough, the bullet passed through his body, hitting no vital organs, and Pearsall was able to walk to the ambulance. The shooter was described as a 17-year-old high school student from Tracy, about 70 miles inland, but in a video, the attacker looks like a full-grown man. The shooter’s name and booking photo were not released. At this writing, no new information or court proceedings have been reported. As Charles Barkley and Ricky Pearsall’s family should know, Proposition 57, the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016, eliminated the direct filing of juvenile cases in adult court. The state Supreme Court ruled it retroactive to all cases that were not yet final. Others who might agree with Charles Barkley include Kate Steinle’s family and friends. On July 1, 2015, the 32-year-old was walking with her father and a friend on San Francisco’s Pier 14 when Jose Inez Garcia Zarate, a previously deported Mexican national, discharged a firearm. The bullet struck Steinle, who died at the scene. In November of 2017, a San Francisco jury found Garcia Zarate not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle. The jury also acquitted the shooter on a manslaughter charge and found him guilty only of felony possession of a firearm. In 2020, federal judge Vince Chhabria ruled that Garcia Zarate suffered from a 'mental illness that is not presently being treated' and was therefore incompetent to stand trial on federal gun charges. In March 2022, Garcia Zarate pleaded guilty to 'being a felon in possession of a firearm and to being an alien unlawfully present in this country in possession of a firearm.' As Charles Barkley should know, dangerous felons are hardly San Francisco’s only problems. By 2019, San Francisco was something of an open-air latrine, with maps marking out favored defecation zones. In 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former mayor, cleaned up San Francisco for the visit of China’s Communist dictator Xi Jinping. The city quickly reverted to the sort of conditions Charles Barkley now decries, particularly the need for a bulletproof vest. Under Senate Bill 1391, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018, any person under age 16 could commit any number of murders and be prosecuted only in juvenile court and gain release at age 25. To adopt a phrase from Scott McKenzie’s 1967 hit, all those who come to San Francisco should know that public safety and hygiene are not top priorities for California’s ruling class.

And Still Growth Is All They Talk About – OpEd	Every year of the past 10 has been the hottest on record, with 2024 topping the heat chart. It’s not only air temperatures that are climbing; in 2024, the oceans of the world also reached a new daily high. 2024 was the first year on record where global average temperatures exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 'From January to September, the global mean surface air temperature was 1.54°C above the pre-industrial average.' The reason the planet continues to heat up is because not enough is being done to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Arising principally from burning fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas), it is GHG emissions that are clogging the lower atmosphere, resulting in global warming. Limiting global warming to 1.5˚C was the target agreed upon by 196 countries at the Paris Climate Accords in 2016. The Paris Agreement 'sets long-term goals to…. hold global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.' President Trump has taken the US out of the legally binding landmark agreement. This reckless and irresponsible step sets a dangerous example for other nations that wish to flaunt environmental commitments, and should be strongly condemned by governments throughout the world. If the current warming trajectory continues, by the early 2030’s 1.5˚C is likely to become the norm, with higher temperatures a real risk. Increases in average ground temperatures of 1.5 or 2 degrees centigrade doesn’t sound like much, but every additional fraction of a degree can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall. 'Every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,' explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. Once established a 1.5˚C world would be hard to reverse, and the risks are manifold: an increase in extreme weather events – more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall and storms; rising sea levels, which in turn increases the risk of costal flooding and erosion; coral reef loss – its estimated that 70-90% of coral reefs could disappear due to ocean warming and acidification; arctic ice loss, affecting ecosystems and global climate patterns; biodiversity loss – up to 14% of land species could face high risk of extinction. If warming of 1.5˚C is normalised and becomes 2˚C (or higher), the impacts would be much worse — doubling the extinction risks, intensifying extreme weather, and making some regions uninhabitable, leading to mass displacement of people. In addition to the environmental impacts, rising temperatures affect communities and economies. A heating planet means food and water shortages and increased risk of heat related illnesses and deaths. Businesses are impacted in affected areas and climate disasters cost trillions of dollars in infrastructure damage and reduced productivity. Its all interconnected Climate change is one aspect of the man-made environmental catastrophe, which is the biggest crisis humanity has ever been confronted with. It is unprecedented in seriousness and impact, short, medium, and long-term. The speed of change is surprising everyone, including climate scientists. 'Both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists— we didn’t think we’d be seeing a year above 1.5˚C this early,' says Dr Hausfather. In all developed and emerging countries, the environmental emergency should be the central issue around which all other matters— economy, development, geo-politics, etc.— are decided. How does this policy, this proposal, impact the planet? Does it have a negative or positive effect on the climate, on local ecosystems, on pollution, etc., or is it neutral? If the proposal increases greenhouse gas emissions, further weakens an endangered species or ecosystem, adds to air/water/soil pollution, or expands desertification. Then the proposal should immediately be dropped; this is what would happen in we were living in a world where responsible governance was standard practice. Sadly we are not. The current crop of political ‘leaders’ are weak, unprincipled, and on the whole, completely inadequate to the colossal challenge that the man-made environmental catastrophe presents. Compromised by their indebtedness to big business, personal ambition, blind adherence to ideology, and complete lack of vision, not only do they consistently fail to address the issues of the day, but their actions routinely intensify the problems. Far from environmental concerns sitting at the forefront of policy-making, irrespective of country or ideology, it is securing economic growth that exercises the minds of politicians, and the drive for profit that determines the actions of corporations. Growth that is strongly dependent on consumerism, and it is unconstrained consumerism within and by rich nations, that is in large part responsible for the environmental catastrophe. Along with competition and social injustice, consumerism is one of the cornerstones of market fundamentalism. Excess is celebrated, selfishness and greed promoted. Not only has this crude materialistic way of life vandalised the natural world, it has encouraged narrow unhealthy behaviour and a set of social norms that have created unhealthy societies populated by frightened, confused people. The health of the planet and the well-being of humanity, as well as the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms are all interconnected. It is one integrated eco-system, one life; infection in one area affects all other parts. There is no such thing as separation, on all levels life is one. Try telling that to the Clown In Chief ensconced in the White House. Whilst governments and (most) corporations/businesses are not interested in putting the environment at the centre of everything, we as individuals can. This means protesting environmental abuse and taking personal responsibility for the way we live. Every decision – shopping, travel, heating, etc., should take into account the environmental impact; if everyone decided to only patronise environmentally responsible businesses, companies large and small would quickly change their strategies. The same applies to politicians, local and national, who are trying to persuade the electorate to vote for them. Given the scale of the crisis such steps may appear tiny, but when adopted by enough people they can have an impact, and doing something rather than nothing alleviates to some degree the feeling of despair. Hope, which is so badly needed at this time, is not based on wishful thinking, but comes about through sustained action.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fPyCPTXDW2KOw	2025-02-14T17:55:36-08:00	
No Agreement On Rare Earths After First Rounds Of US-Ukraine Talk...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused to sign an agreement to grant the United States 50 percent of all future reserves of rare earth metals in Ukraine, according to news reports following a meeting between Zelenskyy and U.S. leaders at the Munich Security Conference on February 14. Zelenskyy 'politely refused' when members of the U.S. Congress proposed the agreement, the Washington Post reported. Zelenskyy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance also discussed a critical minerals deal at the conference, but their meeting ended without an announcement. 'Our teams will continue to work on the document,' Zelenskyy said on X. 'We are ready to move as quickly as possible towards a real and guaranteed peace. We deeply value President [Donald] Trump’s determination, which can help stop the war and secure justice and security guarantees for Ukraine.' Trump said last week that he wants Ukraine to supply the United States with rare earth minerals as a form of payment for U.S. financial support. 'We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earths and other things,' Trump said on February 3 at the White House, discussing how his administration intends to fulfill his campaign promise to quickly end the war in Ukraine. Dozens of rare earth minerals are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense, and Ukraine has large deposits of many of them. Zelenskyy said in February 4 that Ukraine would be 'open to the fact, that all of this can be developed together, along with our partners who can help us protect our lands.' At their Munich meeting, Ukraine gave the U.S. delegation a revised agreement on rare earth metals amid concerns in Kyiv over a U.S. version that was presented to Ukraine on February 12. The revised draft of the deal could open up its vast resources of key minerals to U.S. investment, according to Ukraine. Two members of the Ukrainian delegation told Reuters that 'some details' still needed to be worked out. It was not immediately clear what the sticking points are. The U.S. draft version was presented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who traveled to Kyiv earlier this week with a view to reaching an agreement in Munich. Bessent told Fox Business Network that the Trump administration's plan to end the war would 'intertwine' the Ukrainian economy with the United States and make sure that 'U.S. taxpayers receive the return for the money they put in.' Meeting for 90 minutes with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators behind closed doors in Munich, Zelenskyy voiced concern about the U.S. proposal presented by Bessent, according to Reuters, quoting three sources familiar with his presentation. He 'felt he was being asked unreasonably to sign something he hadn't had a chance to read', one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. 'I don't think he appreciated being given a take-it-or-leave-it thing.' Zelenskyy discussed his own proposal for a mineral deal with the United States, the source said, saying it was drafted to comply with the Ukrainian constitution. Two other sources characterized the proposal delivered by Bessent as 'one-sided,' but declined to elaborate. Zelenskyy’s office said in a statement after the talks that Ukraine and the United States 'agreed to continue their work on drafting the document on economic partnership between the two countries.' The statement also repeated Ukraine's demand for 'real security guarantees.' Zelenskyy said on X that also met with a delegation of members of the U.S. House of Representatives led by Representative Michael Turner (Republican-Ohio) and informed the members about the situation on the battlefield, the results of the Kursk operation, and the threats posed by North Korea's involvement in combat operations. He stressed the need for 'reliable security guarantees,' adding, 'It is important to achieve a guaranteed and lasting peace as soon as possible through our joint strength.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP2LfZrvquG-s	2025-02-14T17:53:37-08:00	
How Israel Can Boost Saudi Vision 2030 – OpEd	A symbiotic relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel is within reach. It could be of huge mutual benefit. Often overlooked in discussions about a possible Abraham Accords deal with Saudi Arabia is the fact that the kingdom is more than halfway through a vastly ambitious and extremely costly redevelopment program called Saudi Vision 2030, initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in 2016. The benefits that a normalization deal with Israel could bring to the program could be vital in helping MBS meet the goals he has set himself. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is less than a hundred years old. It was only in 1932 that Abdul Aziz ibn Saud emerged from many years of political and military struggle against the Ottoman empire and other local chieftains, and was able to name the area he had conquered 'Saudi Arabia', and proclaim himself its monarch. It was doubtless with an eye to the eventual centenary celebrations of the monarchy and the kingdom that in April 2016 MBS launched Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious plan to revitalize the nation state. If it succeeds, by 2032 Saudi Arabia will have been transformed from virtual total dependence on oil revenues into a modern, liberalized, thriving society, its prosperity underpinned by flourishing industrial, financial, economic and commercial sectors. When first announced, Saudi Vision 2030 envisaged, among hundreds of initiatives, privatizing entire sectors of the economy, cutting subsidies, courting investors at home and abroad, streamlining government services, and going public with the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer and most profitable company. This last step was achieved in 2019, when Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) raised $29.4 billion, the largest in history, Yet it was only 1.5% of the company that was sold to the public; the Saudi state and its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, still own 98.5% of Aramco. The most recent progress report, published in April 2024, marked the eighth anniversary of Vision 2030’s launch. A major aim of the program is to achieve economic diversification, and by 2024 non-oil GDP was already contributing 50% to the economy, a record high. To reduce the kingdom’s dependence on oil, Saudi Arabia is also investing heavily in renewable energy projects. The kingdom has become the fastest-growing renewables market outside China. The program also includes nearly 50 large-scale construction and development projects aimed at transforming the nation's infrastructure. A cornerstone of Vision 2030 is Neom, a $500 billion futuristic city sited in the northwest of Saudi Arabia. Envisioned as a hub for innovation and sustainability, it aims to incorporate smart city technologies and renewable energy sources. Recent reports indicate that Neom is facing significant financial challenges, with rising costs and delays leading to concerns about the project's feasibility. This is one obvious area where Israeli hi-tech know-how could help the development. The Red Sea Project is an initiative focused on developing a luxury tourist destination along Saudi Arabia's west coast. With environmental conservation built into the concept, it features resorts across an archipelago of pristine islands and inland sites. When all phases are completed it will comprise 50 resorts offering 8,000 hotel rooms in addition to more than 1,000 residential properties. Saudi Arabia hosts millions of Muslims each year on their Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, but Israeli expertise in global, as opposed to Islamic, tourism could be of invaluable assistance in realizing the project. Positioned near Riyadh, Qiddiya is envisioned as a vast entertainment city, encompassing theme parks, sports facilities, and cultural venues. It aims to become a major tourist destination, contributing to the diversification of the economy. Construction of a variety of parks, performing arts centers. sports stadiums and other projects is forging ahead, with several attractions planned to open well before 2030. Recently announced, the Mukaab is set to be the largest building in the world, featuring a unique cube-shaped design. It is part of the New Murabba development in Riyadh and aims to offer a mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment spaces. Construction has commenced, with the first phase expected to be completed by 2030. Mohammed bin Salman Non-Profit City 'MiSK City', it is claimed, will be the first non-profit city of its kind in the world. It aims to be a city focused on youth, to empower young people, develop their skills, and support young entrepreneurs. A Saudi normalization deal with Israel could have profound implications for Saudi Vision 2030, positively affecting economic growth, regional stability, and technological advancements. For example, Israel is a global leader in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, while Saudi Arabia aims to be an active AI player by 2030. Collaboration in these fields could accelerate Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation. Given Saudi Arabia's desert environment, Israeli expertise in desalination, water conservation, and desert agriculture could enhance food and water security, aligning with Vision 2030's desalination projects and sustainability goals. Saudi Arabia, its urban centers sited between Israel and the Gulf, could become a logistics hub, linking Israel to Gulf markets, particularly through Neom, the planned high-tech city near the Red Sea. A formal Saudi-Israel relationship could open the door to increased Western and Israeli investments in Saudi Arabia, particularly in sectors like technology, cybersecurity, and renewable energy, helping the kingdom achieve even greater economic diversification. Just as in the case of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a normalization deal could bring Israeli tourists flooding into the country, and Israel becoming a key tourist market, helping the program’s aim of increasing tourism’s contribution to GDP to 10% by 2030. A Saudi-Israel deal would likely be accompanied by US security guarantees and incentives, such as advanced defense systems, security guarantees, and potential support for Saudi Arabia’s civil nuclear program, boosting Vision 2030’s energy sector and reinforcing Saudi’s position as a regional power. Saudi Arabia has historically tied normalization to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Any viable deal would need to take this position into account. President Donald Trump's recent suggestions regarding Gaza's future have not, as yet, touched on future Palestinian autonomy, but thinking on this matter is fairly advanced by the Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution, a body co-chaired by Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud and Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide. The alliance, launched in September 2024, has convened multiple times to advance the idea of a development program, phased over several years, leading toward Palestinian sovereignty. The mere existence and continued activity of the alliance may be sufficient to allow the process leading to an Abraham Accord deal to proceed. Saudi-Israeli normalization could undoubtedly help Vision 2030 reach its objectives by attracting investment, fostering technological growth, and expanding tourism. The pace at which these benefits might accrue would inevitably depend on a variety of factors, but the potential for a Saudi-Israeli partnership of enormous mutual advantage could certainly follow the formal induction of Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP5kqqfhnNjbd	2025-02-14T17:47:09-08:00	
Argentina Court Calls For Arrest Warrant For Myanmar Junta Chief	A court in Argentina has ruled that international arrest warrants be issued for Myanmar’s self-appointed president and junta chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, and 22 other military officials for crimes committed against the Rohingya Muslim minority, the plaintiff and attorney in the case told Radio Free Asia on Friday. The Burmese Rohingya Organization UK, or BROUK, filed a petition in Argentina in 2019 on behalf of Rohingya victims of a 2017 military crackdown that the group says amounted to genocide. Argentina became the first country to open an investigation into serious crimes against the Rohingya under the principle of universal jurisdiction, a legal principle allowing for the prosecution of serious crimes no matter where they were committed. In a statement, BROUK said a court in Buenos Aires had ruled that arrest warrants be issued for Min Aung Hlaing and the other Burmese military officials. The court said that the officials’ identity should first be confirmed and they be called to testify. 'This is a historic step towards justice for Rohingya and everyone in Burma suffering under the Burmese military,' said Tun Khin, president of the BROUK, referring to Myanmar. Myanmar government troops led a bloody crackdown in Rakhine state in 2017 in response to Rohingya militant attacks on the security forces and some 740,000 members of the persecuted Rohingya community fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where most remain. U.N. experts later said the military carried out mass killings and gang rapes with 'genocidal intent.' The United States in 2022 determined that the violence committed against the Rohingya amounted to genocide and crimes against humanity. The Myanmar military has always insisted it was engaged in legitimate security operations. A spokesperson was not immediately available for comment on the arrest warrants. Hope for action Military leaders rarely travel abroad and then only to close allies like China, but Tun Khin said he was hopeful there would be action. 'As the warrant will be sent to all countries, Interpol will probably implement it. We wholeheartedly believe this,' Tun Khin. 'This arrest warrant isn’t only to get justice for us Rohingya. I want to say it’s to get justice for all our citizens. Speaking to RFA, Tomas Quintana, the attorney representing BROUK’s complaint, said that once the court in Buenos Aires confirmed the identities of the suspects, it would send a communication to the global police organization Interpol, requesting that it issue red notices, which are alerts seeking the arrests of wanted persons with a view to extradition. 'And then, it will be for Interpol to enforce these arrest warrants,' said Quintana, who served as United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar between 2008 and 2014. In the meantime, he said, the Rohingya community has welcomed the first decision by a court of law to issue warrants for the perpetrators of the crackdown. 'And even though we will have some challenges to enforce the arrest warrants, it’s a very important thing now to those who have been committing crimes not only in Burma, but also around the world,' Quintana said. 'If you commit a crime against humanity, if you commit genocide, then you will have to be held to account, whether in your country or in any country in the world, because we are talking about a crime that affects the conscience of all humanity,' he added. Warrant requested for Suu Kyi Among the 22 other top military officials named in the warrants, is the deputy commander-in-chief, Soe Win. Others include officers operating in Rakhine state at the time. It is not the only legal effort aimed at bringing to justice those responsible for crimes against the Rohingya. International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan requested an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing in November. However, it has yet to rule on whether to grant it. A Rohingya community leader welcomed the ruling in Argentina. 'We’re glad. Our people were being killed illegally and the people who were committing genocide will never be free,' said Khin Maung, spokesperson for the Rohingya Youth Organization in Bangladesh. In total, the Argentinian court called for issuing warrants for 25 people, not all of whom are military officials, such as the leader of the former civilian government, Aung San Suu Kyi, and former President Htin Kyaw. In its initial 2019 petition, the BROUK included Suu Kyi and Htin Kyaw. But after they and their government were ousted in 2021 the BROUK requested that the court consider if warrants for their arrests 'serves the best interests of justice at this time.' Tun Khin said the military leaders were the main target of his group’s petition.' Within the arrest warrant in BROUK’s application, the established military personnel were the ones requested in the warrant,' he said. Suu Kyi, trying to ensure the survival of her fragile government in the face of a looming threat from the military, went to the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 2019 to rejected accusations of genocide committed against the Rohingya as 'incomplete and misleading.' For years Suu Kyi had been feted in the West as a heroine of democracy but her statement at the U.N.‘s highest court, in which she described the military action in Rakhine state in 2017 as a 'clearance operation,' did serious damage to her reputation. It also failed to protect her elected government from a military coup just over a year later.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fPzz6UQInD2wU	2025-02-14T17:41:52-08:00	
Arab World-Arab American Collaboration Could Be A Game-Changer – ...	The driving force behind nearly every major conflict in the Arab and Muslim worlds, from Syria to Iraq and Afghanistan to Sudan, has been or is US foreign policy, in conjunction with individual American allies. Washington leverages its influence over the Arab and Muslim worlds through billions of dollars in annual foreign aid, through trade including oil and through the manipulation of pro-American media outlets that have influence throughout the Middle East. Foreign aid has long been provided to several Arab countries, including $1.3 billion per year to Egypt, $1.5 billion to Jordan, between $200 million and $1 billion to Iraq and more than $1 billion to help the Syrian people, to name just a few. Mainstream American news media outlets — several of which receive direct US government assistance through massive subscription purchases and hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising — help advance America’s interest through propaganda that impacts how the rest of the world sees the country’s policies. Only one Middle East nation has orchestrated a sophisticated, multilevel strategy to manage all that influence, define media reporting to reflect its narrative and secure America’s unwavering support. That is Israel, which has a record of killing and injuring more Arabs and Muslims than any other country. So, why do the Arab and Muslim worlds not do what Israel has done through its lobbying apparatus to strengthen American support for its interests? Why have they not turned to Arab Americans to help make US politicians more sympathetic to their concerns, policies and needs? Arab and Muslim Americans played an important role in Donald Trump’s election victory last year, as acknowledged by the president himself. In the left-leaning and very pro-Israel mainstream American news media, however, Arab and Muslim voters are often blamed for electing Trump, whose recent policy announcements have riled the political establishment. Media critics generally ignore the fact that, while Trump may make frequent shoot-from-the-hip policy announcements that anger or perplex them, his predecessor funded, armed and protected at the UN the 15-month Israeli genocide that took the lives of almost 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza. On the face of it, American foreign policy and its double standards when it comes to applying principles and justice fairly are perplexing. But it is only thus because the Arab world and Arab Americans are estranged and do not work together. Israel’s immorally excessive response to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack and American’s blind embrace of the false propaganda narrative Israel uses to justify its violent actions, which the International Criminal Court alleges can be described as 'war crimes,' has created an opportunity for the relationship to be reset. Now is the time for Arabs in America and the Middle East to come together, set aside their differences, speak with one voice and change the destructive pattern that has engulfed so many Arab countries. A partnership like that can refocus responsibility for the region’s troubles on the one country that claims to want to be 'accepted' in the Middle East, but which seeks to redefine and control it: Israel. Israel is most vulnerable to a powerful countercampaign to influence the American understanding of Middle Eastern events. In 1973, Saudi Arabia demonstrated how powerful the Arab world was when it led the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries in imposing an oil embargo on the US in response to its one-sided bias toward Israeli violence. Israel claimed to be the victim but in fact it was the provocateur, initiating violence that it then redefined through US-driven media propaganda. That moment created a major shift between the West and the Arab world. America went through a crisis. Since then, Arab world oil prices have been managed in a one-sided relationship with America, resulting in the lowest possible gasoline prices for Americans, who only pay a little more than $3 per gallon on average — less than half the cost in many other countries. Israel has an equivalent to the oil power of the Arab world, but it is far less expensive. In the last national election cycle, pro-Israeli political action committees donated almost $5 million into the campaign coffers of candidates for some of the most influential American political offices, from state governors to members of Congress. These donations helped pro-Israel candidates win office, thereby giving Tel Aviv enormous influence. Instead of fueling the anger of Americans by imposing higher oil prices, Israel’s campaign addresses a political need in a positive way, building political devotion to its needs. The Arab world can easily do the same thing through the right Arab American activists. A few million dollars could shift the vote in Congress away from Israel’s narrow interests to embrace the interests of the Arab world. And a few million more to fund a pro-Arab public relations campaign via the media could significantly alter American public attitudes. We are talking about a campaign through Arab American activists costing maybe $10 million to $20 million to alter America’s intrinsically anti-Arab, anti-Muslim policies. It will not happen overnight. But the dynamics of today’s world and the increasing violence in the Middle East create an opportunity that must be grasped in order to stop the destructive spread of Western-backed violence throughout the Middle East and to undermine the growing anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia sweeping through the US. It would cost so little, why would we not try?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP_9eaE-o_WFl	2025-02-14T17:33:01-08:00	
Pope Francis Hospitalized At Gemelli For Bronchitis	By Hannah Brockhaus Pope Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on Friday to undergo testing and treatment for bronchitis, the Vatican said. 'The Holy Father, as a result of the recent exacerbation of bronchitis, has carried out specialized examinations and started a hospital drug therapy,' read a Holy See Press Office statement updating the pope’s condition Friday evening Rome time. 'The first examinations performed show a respiratory tract infection. The clinical condition is fair; he presents mild febrile alteration.' The pope is serene, his mood is good, and he has read a few newspapers, according to Matteo Bruni, director of the Holy See Press Office. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized in the late morning on Feb. 14 following meetings with a number of people, including the prime minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico. 'This morning, at the end of his audiences, Pope Francis will be admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Hospital for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue treatment for bronchitis, that is still ongoing, in a hospital setting,' the Holy See Press Office said in a message sent shortly before 11 a.m. Rome time. The Vatican said that due to Pope Francis’ hospitalization, his appointments for the following three days were canceled. In particular, he will no longer hold a jubilee audience at the Vatican on Saturday, Feb. 15, or a meeting with artists at the historic Cinecittà film studios south of Rome on Feb. 17. The pope was also scheduled to participate in a Mass in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday for the Jubilee of Artists and the World of Culture, part of the Church’s wider 2025 Jubilee of Hope. The Vatican said Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, will celebrate the Mass. Pope Francis has been sick with bronchitis for over a week. On Feb. 6, the Vatican announced the pope would hold most of his meetings that day and the following days in rooms at his Vatican residence in order to rest more. Despite the illness, which has largely prevented the pontiff from reading his own speeches and homilies, Francis presided at a jubilee Mass for members of the police and armed forces in St. Peter’s Square on Feb. 9 and participated in his weekly general audience on Wednesday. Pope Francis was also hospitalized for a respiratory infection in March 2023 and canceled a November 2023 trip to Dubai due to a 'very acute infectious bronchitis.' The pope, who has been suffering from visible breathlessness during recent meetings, has more and more frequently declined to read his prepared remarks to audiences or opted to have the remarks read by a priest aide. He has faced several health challenges in recent years, including knee problems requiring a wheelchair, respiratory infections, and a fall resulting in a forearm contusion.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP0c9vuLKzxCG	2025-02-14T17:31:52-08:00	
Vance Warns European Allies Of Threat From Within’	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned European allies attending the security conference in Munich, Germany, against 'the threat from within,' arguing that European governments are exercising extreme censorship and have failed to adequately get a handle on 'out-of-control migration.' 'The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,' he said Friday. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' Vance denounced Romania, a NATO ally, for its recent cancellation of presidential election results over evidence of Russian disinformation. 'If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,' he said. 'I’d ask my European friends to have some perspective.' He also appeared to voice support for right-wing anti-immigration parties that have been banned from joining governments in Europe, including the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls,' he said, referring to Berlin’s 'firewall' effort against extremism in a country still haunted by the role of the Nazi party in the past. Vance met with AfD leader Alice Weidel on Friday, according to an official in the vice president’s office. Vance said of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the U.S. 'there is nothing more pressing than migration.' He blamed the 'series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world,' and he highlighted the Thursday attack in Munich where an Afghan national drove a car into a crowd, injuring at least 30 people. The remarks came as a surprise to the audience of leaders and top officials who were expecting Vance to focus on Ukraine and Russia. The vice president only made a passing remark on the issue. The Trump administration is 'very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine,' Vance said. 'And we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.' Following Vance’s speech, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius rejected Vance’s characterization of European policies. 'If I understand him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regions ... that is not acceptable.' Vance’s remarks are 'an effort to flip the script,' on Europe’s concerns about American democracy, said Kristine Berzina, managing director of GMF Geostrategy North. 'There was shockingly no mention of NATO, no discussion of Ukraine. Instead, it was the presentation of a right-wing vision of democracy days before the German election,' she told VOA. In his meeting with Vance on the sidelines of the conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more discussion is needed 'to prepare the plan [on] how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and finish the war.' 'Really, we want peace very much, but we need real security guarantees,' he said. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Munich, Zelenskyy said his priority is to speak with U.S. and European officials before engaging with the Russians. Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the conference. Ukraine said its delegation will present its position on ending the war. Zelenskyy said that if Trump could bring him and Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer to swap Ukrainian-occupied territory in Russia for Russian-held land in Ukraine. Peace talks with Russia Speaking to reporters from the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump said Vance’s speech was 'very brilliant,' and warned Europe 'to be careful.' On Wednesday he spoke with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, which will mark its three-year anniversary on Feb. 24. Trump said he and the Russian president have 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' to end the war. Trump told White House reporters Thursday that Kyiv’s NATO membership bid is 'impractical' and its desire to win back Russian-occupied territories 'illusionary.' His comments mirror remarks made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who said Wednesday at NATO headquarters that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO — something Zelenskyy argues is central to protecting Ukraine in the long-term, but that Putin has long opposed. Hegseth also called Ukraine's desire to regain territory that it lost to Russia an 'unrealistic objective.' Additionally, Trump said it was a mistake to kick Moscow out of the Group of Seven of industrialized democracies, then known as the G8, following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. 'I'd love to have them back,' Trump said, adding that he and Putin 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s nations' and added that they would 'probably' meet in Saudi Arabia soon. Russian politicians have welcomed the shift from former President Joe Biden’s policies that aimed to isolate Moscow. 'I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with horror and cannot believe their eyes,' senior Russian lawmaker Alexei Pushkov wrote on his messaging app Friday. European leaders have said they worry Washington is conceding key agenda items to Putin that would jeopardize Kyiv’s standing toward a potential settlement of the conflict. 'A failed Ukraine would weaken Europe, but it would also weaken the United States,' warned European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke before Vance in Munich. It is unclear what the Trump administration’s ultimate strategy is to end the war — a promise the president campaigned on. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Friday ahead of his Munich speech, Vance said Moscow could face more sanctions and even 'military tools' if it refuses to agree to a deal ensuring Ukraine's long-term independence. Gaza and the fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas also are likely to be a focus in Munich. Trump recently said that Palestinians should leave Gaza and that the U.S. will take over the enclave — a proposition that several governments have condemned. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence.

Robert Reich: Profiles In Courage – OpEd	Sometimes it takes a crisis to reveal one’s true character. This is especially true of people who occupy positions of leadership, both in the private and public sectors. Are they courageous, or are they cowards? Worse yet, are they complicit in doing grave harm? During the current crisis of American democracy, we know who’s in the complicit category: House Speaker Mike Johnson and almost all other Republican lawmakers. Several CEOs: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Rupert Murdoch. And many Fox News personalities. History (to the extent future historians have access to the truth) will judge them harshly as traitors to America. As to the cowards, I’d include Jamie Dimon, chair and CEO of JPMorganChase, the largest bank in the United States, who likes to think of himself as a spokesperson for American business. Dimon and others like him are playing along with Trump and Musk. What about the courageous? A few Democratic lawmakers are finally showing some spine. But today I’d like to honor unsung heroes whose courage in the face of the Trump-Musk takeover of America deserves our profound thanks. They are public servants who have chosen to fight rather than submit to Trump’s treachery, contesting his blatantly illegal attempts to fire them. They include: 1. Phyllis Fong, the former inspector general of the Department of Agriculture. When she got notice that the Trump regime was terminating her employment, Fong informed her colleagues that she intended to remain in her position because Trump had not followed proper legal procedures in terminating her. When security guards told Fong — a 22-year veteran of the department — she had to leave, she did not go quietly. She had to be dragged out of her office. The inspector general of the Department of Agriculture has a broad mandate to protect the public — pursuing consumer food safety, consumer health (such as tracking the bird flu that’s been spreading among cattle and chickens and killed at least one person so far), and auditing and investigating government payments to a large number of contractors. In 2022, Fong’s office launched an investigation of Elon Musk’s brain implant startup,Neuralink. With Fong out of the picture, that investigation now appears on its way to being closed. For her long-standing dedication to the people of the United States and her steadfastness in seeking to remain in her important job, Fong deserves to be known as a profile in courage. 2. Brian Driscoll, acting FBI director. Driscoll has refused a Justice Department order that he assist in firing FBI employees involved in investigating the people responsible for violence in the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. When Driscoll notified his staff about the Justice Department’s order, he wrote, 'I am one of those employees.' Driscoll took part in the arrest of Samuel Fisher, an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, in Manhattan two weeks after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. FBI agents found in Fisher’s Upper East Side apartment and car over a thousand rounds of ammunition and several weapons, including an illegally modified AR-15 rifle and machetes. In 2022, Fisher was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after he pleaded guilty to a gun possession charge in Manhattan Supreme Court. He also pleaded guilty in federal court to illegally entering the Capitol on January 6. Trump pardoned Fisher on January 20. In a defiant email sent last Friday night, James Dennehy, the top FBI agent in the New York field office, warned his staff that the FBI was 'in the middle of a battle of our own.' Praising Driscoll and Driscoll’s deputy, Robert C. Kissane, as 'warriors,' Dennehy said they were 'fighting for this organization.' FBI agents have anonymously sued to block dissemination of the names of agents who worked on the January 6 cases. For his refusal to furnish the names of FBI agents who helped investigate the January 6 assailants, Driscoll deserves to be seen as a profile in courage. 3. Ellen L. Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission. Trump tried to fire Weintraub last Thursday, but she is fighting the dismissal. Weintraub wrote in an X post, to which she attached Trump’s dismissal letter: 'Received a letter from POTUS today purporting to remove me as Commissioner & Chair of FEC. I’ve been lucky to serve the American people & stir up some good trouble along the way. That’s not changing anytime soon. There’s a legal way to replace FEC commissioners — this isn’t it.' According to federal law, FEC commissioners are appointed to six-year terms. Because the FEC is an independent agency with a highly sensitive mission, its commissioners can be removed only for cause. Trump’s communication did not invoke any cause for the removal. Commissioners can remain at the FEC past their term’s expiration date until a replacement is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Trump’s attempt to fire Weintraub comes just as the FEC was considering complaints involving the 2024 Trump campaign and Elon Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC. In comments to The New York Times, Weintraub said she wasn’t surprised to be targeted by Trump. She had publicly complained that the FEC’s structure of six commissioners, no more than three of whom can be from the same political party, ensures 3-3 gridlock on enforcement matters, including ones involving the president’s campaigns. For her courageous stand, Weintraub deserves to be seen as a profile in courage. 4. Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel. Dellinger runs the office that enforces federal whistleblower laws and the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in most political activity. In the 1978 law that established Dellinger’s job, Congress provided that the special counsel can be removed only for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' Trump fired Dellinger on Friday. On Monday, Dellinger sued, calling his removal illegal, arguing that nothing about his performance could possibly meet the standard Congress laid out for dismissing a special counsel. 'Since my arrival at OSC last year, I could not be more proud of all we have accomplished,' Dellinger said. 'The agency’s work has earned praise from advocates for whistleblowers, veterans, and others. The effort to remove me has no factual nor legal basis — none — which means it is illegal.' Dellinger continues to police the government against Hatch Act violations, even when they involve federal workers who allegedly discriminated against Trump. In a complaint filed Tuesday, Dellinger alleged that, during a hurricane response in October, an aid supervisor for the Federal Emergency Management Agency illegally instructed FEMA workers not to visit homes with Trump signs. On Monday night, Judge Amy Berman Jackson blocked Dellinger’s dismissal at least through today, as she hears arguments in the case. For choosing to fight, Dellinger is a profile in courage. 5. Gwynne Wilcox, chair of the National Labor Relations Board. After being dismissed by Trump last week, Wilcox sued, arguing that the statute governing her position allows removal 'for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.' By firing her, Trump also made the NLRB inoperative, because it no longer has the number of commissioners needed to make rulings. Not incidentally, when Trump fired Wilcox, 24 separate cases were pending against Musk before the NLRB. For choosing to sue Trump, Wilcox is a profile in courage. 6. Federal workers who are peacefully resisting. I also want to salute other federal workers who are resisting Trump’s arbitrary and illegal orders terminating their employment. The staff of the General Services Administration have flooded online communications channels like Slack with spoon emojis in response to Musk’s 'Fork in the Road' buyout offer. Scores of other federal workers have marked the buyout memo and other emails from Trump and Musk as 'spam.' Thousands of federal workers in agencies that collect or analyze sensitive data have launched encrypted chats to discuss how they can best shield the data from Trump and Musk. Also meriting our profound thanks are federal workers who are showing up to and leading the protests at USAID, the Department of Labor, and other agencies targeted by the Trump-Vance-Musk regime. The 'fednews' subreddit, an online forum popular with government workers, has seen multiple highly upvoted posts urging fellow workers to 'hold the line' and 'support the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic' by NOT resigning. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, now has the highest number of dues-paying members in its 92-year history. Four thousand federal workers joined the union in the first five days of February. *** The public servants who are defying and contesting the Trump-Vance-Musk coup are putting themselves, their jobs, their careers, and in some cases the well-being of their families on the line. They are doing so because they believe in the importance of their jobs in protecting and helping the American public, and they justifiably believe Trump and Musk are violating the law. In sharp contrast to those who are complicit in the Trump-Vance-Musk coup and those who are too cowardly to speak up against it, these men and women are today’s true patriots.

Washington Must Control The Panama Canal To Guarantee Regional Se...	With President Donald J. Trump at the White House, the golden age of America has begun. Global Security Governance will be extremely enhanced under the America First Strategy of President Trump. In the Americas the revival of the Monroe Doctrine under the magnificent leadership of President Trump, will generate a cautious reliance of Latin American nations towards other economies across the Pacific. As the world is moving from the Industrial to the Intelligence age, the United Nations continues to be an obsolete and highly corrupt organization; it suffers from the very endemic syndrome of corruption demonstrated by the USAID and its incompetent bureaucrats operating within its rotten administrative capillaries. The dismantling of USAID offices at home and abroad by the Trump – Vance administration is historic, will save billions of U.S. Dollars to American taxpayers, and uphold the U.S. National Security Interests in the International Stage. President Trump has emerged as the best U.S. Head of State since the early days of President Abraham Lincoln. Guided by the legendary conservative principles, shaped under the leadership of President Ronald Wilson Reagan; the current White House will also, and legitimately so, take control of the Panama Canal that was built under the leadership of President Theodore Roosevelt who oversaw the realization of a long-term objective of the United States —a trans-isthmian canal. For American and British entrepreneurs and governments it was imperative to ship goods efficiently and quickly between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts during the 19th Century. Panama Canal continues to be the principal engineering marvel in the Americas and Washington has the legitimate right to exert full operational control and ensure its safety by employing all tools of statecraft and military technology as well as tactics. It is disturbing to listen how a renowned Latin American businessman Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego (founder and President of Mexico’s Grupo Salinas) is giving a talk at the World Government Summit 2025 in Dubai calling 'North Americans stupid'. The United States is blessed to be governed by the Trump – Vance Administration which is highly committed to restore America’s privileged position in the world stage, so that foreign entrepreneurs including Salinas would not dare to scoff at Americans again. In this context the Panama Canal has been the principal resource of wealth and income for all Panamanians and remains a vital logistical corridor for global shipping more than a century after its construction. It is the lifeblood of the Panamanian economy, generating US$5 billion in the last fiscal year. However, previous administrators of the Canal, Ricardo Martinelli (Former Panamanian President) and former President Juan Carlos Varela, are both under investigation for corruption and money laundering, at home and abroad. It is evident that both former top officials of the Central American nation have massively abused with the Canal’s impressive revenues and financial resources. The posture of the White House with regards to the Panama Canal will bring high levels of accountability, regional security measures that were never seen before as well as reduce fraud and waste within the canal’s operations. The United States established diplomatic relations with Panama in 1903 following its declaration of independence from Colombia. Panama’s location and role in international trade make it an indispensable actor that ensures the U.S. prosperity and national security. Panama’s location in central America has made the nation to become a major land and sea transit route where illegal drugs destined for the United States can be stopped and destroyed. While Panama’s economic growth rate is among the highest in the hemisphere, the country faces the challenge of making this growth more inclusive; and the willingness of Washington to take full control of the Canal, will generate more resources and further increase the microeconomic levels within the Panamanian society. On February 2nd, 2025, the U. S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino and Minister of Foreign Affairs Javier Martínez-Acha in Panama City at the Palacio de Las Garzas. U. S. foreign policy chief addressed critical regional and global challenges. In his latest visit to Panama City, Secretary Marco Rubio stated in a press conference: 'Panama is a country that is a friend, a brother, that we have many ties with and a great deal of cooperation. What’s happened in this hemisphere with mass migration is quite unfortunate. It’s a tragedy, and we have people who – as part of this process – in many cases people are victims or have been victimized through this irregular path that has created issues for many countries in the region. We also understand from the United States that most people who come in here have as a goal eventually making it to the United States, so you could say that at a certain point our border doesn’t begin at Texas or Mexico; it begins a lot farther down.' Secretary Rubio underscored the desire for an improved U. S. – Panama investment climate and brought to the attention of President Mulino that the current 'position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal area is a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal.' Secretary Rubio made it clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the Treaty. Furthermore, the U.S. – Panama cooperation program that helps to stop people with criminal histories, from going forward and creating problems in Panama, has been working well. In the same vein, Panama and its government must take decisive actions, and be fully transparent, towards ensuring the fulfillment of the two bilateral treaties that it signed with the United States. As the Carter administration shaped the public opinion in favor of turning in the Canal to Panama’s leadership; Washington would soon find out that this mega project would favor illicit enrichment for only a few local politicians as the rest of the population continues to live in misery. A very similar approach to USAID projects in Latin America and Africa, where corrupt government officials extract all foreign donations and drain the public coffers. These negotiations in the 1970s were endorsed by Actor John Wayne and Torrijos hosted U.S. Senators in Panama, where he stressed that he was neither an enemy of the United States nor a communist. The negotiators in Washington decided that their best chance for ratification was to submit two treaties to the U.S. Senate. The first, called The Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, or the Neutrality Treaty, stated that the United States could use its military to defend the Panama Canal against any threat to its neutrality, thus allowing perpetual U.S. usage of the Canal. The second, called The Panama Canal Treaty, stated that the Panama Canal Zone would cease to exist on October 1, 1979, and the Canal itself would be turned over to the Panamanians on December 31, 1999. These two treaties were signed on September 7, 1977. Just as the fruitful cooperation on successfully tackling illegal immigration, Panama is obliged to respect the Treaty and invite Washington to take control of the Canal; a move that would greatly benefit its people and ensure a greater economic growth and stability for all Panamanians and the Central American region overall. Panama’s Canal administration deserves a greater scrutiny by Washington, being a major global trade hub that has not fared well within the latest geostrategic hurdles. Nevertheless, the Trump – Vance Administration has the unbridled courage, brilliant statecraft, competency, intrepidity and steady determination to bring the administration of the Canal back on track and ensure all massive revenues that it generates do not leave the hemisphere. The Panama Canal is an enduring investment – built completely with the money and labor force of the United States of America – for the bright future of U.S. National Security, Washington’s geopolitical interests and is the fulcrum of Central America’s economic prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm17w0etrt4Eps	2025-02-14T15:56:08-08:00	
Trees Might Need Our Help To Survive Climate Change	A new Colorado State University study of the interior U.S. West has found that tree ranges are generally contracting in response to climate change but not expanding into cooler, wetter climates – suggesting that forests are not regenerating fast enough to keep pace with climate change, wildfire, insects and disease. As the climate becomes too warm for trees in certain places, tree ranges have been expected to shift toward more ideal conditions. The study analyzed national forest inventory data for more than 25,000 plots in the U.S. West, excluding coastal states, and found that trees were not regenerating in the hottest portions of their ranges – an expected outcome. More surprising to the researchers was that most of the 15 common tree species studied were not gaining any ground in areas where conditions were more favorable, indicating that most tree species likely will not be able to move to more accommodating climates without assistance. 'Trees provide a lot of value to humans in terms of clean water, clean air, wildlife habitat and recreation,' said lead author Katie Nigro, who conducted the study as a CSU graduate student. 'If forest managers want to keep certain trees on the landscape, our study shows where they can still exist or where they might need help.' Shrinking ranges were prevalent across undisturbed areas as well as those impacted by wildfire, insects and disease. Using 30 years of disturbance data, the researchers tested the idea that disturbances – particularly wildfire – might catalyze tree movement into cooler, wetter areas by killing adult trees and eliminating competition for seedlings to establish in their preferred climate zone. 'Just like us and every species, trees can only function within a certain climatic tolerance, and different species have different climatic tolerances,' Nigro said. 'I thought we would find more shifts into cooler zones, especially in burned areas.' Results of the study, published in Nature Climate Change, give a broad overview of the predominant pattern – an overall failure to regenerate in the hottest, driest portions of a tree’s range, but also failure to expand along the range’s cooler, wetter border. Nigro cautioned that it’s possible not enough time has passed to see new tree establishment in cooler, wetter areas, especially for slow-growing subalpine species. She added that more, local studies are needed to determine which species will survive where. The paper makes the case for human-assisted tree migration because rapid warming from climate change is likely to outpace regeneration. 'One of the potential issues is that we may get bigger and bigger mismatches between where trees are living and their ideal climate,' Nigro said. Trees seeking cooler temps face uphill battle Increasing wildfire, insect and disease disturbances due to climate change also can prevent regeneration by removing seed sources, and seeds literally have an uphill battle in trying to gain ground upslope, where conditions are cooler. 'There's a lot of things that prevent a seed from moving uphill, including gravity,' said co-author Monique Rocca, an associate professor of ecosystem science and sustainability. 'A lot of conditions need to be in place for a tree to be able to move to cooler, wetter sites.' She continued, 'This study digs into some of the details of where trees are staying on the landscape on their own versus where we may need to intervene if our goal is to keep Western landscapes covered in trees.' A few species fared better than others. Of the four species that continued to regenerate in the areas they already occupied regardless of climate change, wildfire, and insect and disease outbreaks, three of them are rarer on the landscape, so it is harder to accurately gauge their response, and one, Gambel oak, is a resilient, heat- and drought-tolerant resprouting species. The study used long-term field data from the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis program, sometimes referred to as the national 'tree census.' Study plots on forested areas across the nation are surveyed continuously to track individual tree growth or losses through harvest, disease or death. Kristen Pelz, analysis team lead with the inventory and analysis program, co-authored the study. 'Dr. Nigro harnessed the power of our field-collected data to show how forests are changing across the interior West – not theoretically, but today,' Pelz said. 'Her work is important because it considers how things like fire and native insects interact with climate, which is essential where natural disturbances have been a primary driver of forest dynamics for millennia.' Rather than looking at changes in the average tree range, as past studies have done, this study went a step further and examined the cold and warm margins of species’ ranges – the leading and trailing edges – which specifies how tree ranges are shifting in more detail and provides actionable insights for forest managers. If trees were expanding into cooler areas on their own, assisted migration wouldn’t be as important. 'This research can help land managers and foresters decide whether to hang on to trees in the hottest portions of their ranges for as long as possible or to transition to a more heat- and drought-tolerant system,' Nigro said, adding that sometimes assisted migration can be done with seeds of the same species that are adapted to a warmer environment. In her current research as an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education postdoctoral fellow with the Rocky Mountain Research Station, Nigro is trying to identify which seeds from a single species might have the best odds of surviving under harsher climate conditions. Co-author Miranda Redmond, who was Nigro’s Ph.D. adviser at CSU, is also following up on this research by studying tree species adaptations at UC Berkeley. 'These efforts are becoming increasingly critical due to the rapid pace and scale of tree die-offs from wildfires, drought and other climate-driven disturbances, coupled with tree regeneration failures observed in many areas,' Redmond said. Nigro added, 'Planting likely will be required to keep trees on the landscape where they are most valued, and we may need to accept new ecosystems in areas that are inevitably going to change. Our future forests might look different and contain different trees than they do today.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm10i83i92uZvE	2025-02-14T15:53:34-08:00	
Remembering Emperor Babur, Descendant of Emir Temour And Genghis ...	The Taj Mahal, known as a wonder of the world, was built by a Timurid (Mughal) Turkish ruler. The Mughals were a Turkic dynasty from Central Asia. The founder of the Mughal Empire, Babur, was of Turkic origin and descended from the Timurids. Today marks Babur’s 542nd birthday. Happy birthday! The Mughals (or Baburids) were a Timurid (Uzbek) dynasty. Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, was of Uzbek Turkic origin and descended from the Timurids (Timurid Empire). As a result, the Baburids, descendants of Timur, ruled the Indian subcontinent until British colonization. Babur would have turned 542 years old today. He was born on February 14, 1483, in Andijan, in present-day Uzbekistan. Zahir ud-Din Muhammad Babur was a descendant of Emir Timur on his father’s side and Genghis Khan on his mother’s side. He was the founder of the Mughal Empire. As a Timurid prince, he followed in the footsteps of his ancestor Timur and carved his name into history. At the time of his death, his empire stretched from Afghanistan to Bengal in India. In addition to his military genius, Babur was also renowned for his literary works. Inspired by the great poet Ali-Shir Nava’i, he wrote his masterpiece, the Baburnama, in the Chagatai Turkic language. During his reign, poetry, biology, geography, and history flourished, making him a key figure of the Timurid Renaissance, who deserves greater study in the West. Despite his conquest of India, Babur was known for his religious tolerance, which made him far ahead of Western rulers of his time. He never forced anyone to convert to Islam, making him a central figure of Timurid humanism. In summary, the Mughal Empire lasted until the 19th century. Even the Taj Mahal is a Mughal creation, as this magnificent monument was built under the orders of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor. Recognized as one of the world’s greatest wonders, the Taj Mahal is a testament to the extraordinary cultural achievements of the Timurid Renaissance. Thus, although structures like the Taj Mahal were built by the Mughal Empire, these projects were deeply influenced by Uzbek’s cultural and architectural heritage, giving them a distinctly Timurid artistic and architectural character. This magnificent monument was constructed during the Mughal era. The Mughal Empire was an Uzbek-Turkic state that ruled India from the 16th to the 18th century. The Taj Mahal’s construction was carried out under the reign of Shah Jahan, the fifth emperor of the Mughal Empire.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm1xb3CZfNdiFE	2025-02-14T15:51:03-08:00	
New Blood Test Could Improve Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis	Up to half of all people living with Alzheimer’s Disease in Ireland remain undiagnosed. Now, a new blood test may have the potential to transform patient care, allowing for better diagnosis, earlier interventions and more targeted treatments. Researchers at Trinity College Dublin, the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition and St James’s Hospital, Dublin are exploring the ability of a new blood test, plasma p-tau217, to detect Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This test could potentially replace the current diagnostic method, a lumbar puncture/spinal tap (which is invasive and poses risks and challenges) in over half of patients with early symptoms, thus allowing more patients to be diagnosed more accurately and with greater efficiency. The study is published in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment and Disease Monitoring. In Ireland, over 60,000 people live with dementia, with Alzheimer’s Disease accounting for about 70% of cases. In order to enable accurate diagnosis, biomarkers are currently measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained using a diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) procedure. An accurate clinical biological diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is valued by patients and aids future medical care. Of those in Ireland currently living with Alzheimer’s Disease, up to half do not have a formal diagnosis, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods which are accurate and can be used at scale. The study is one of the first in Europe to examine the 'real-world' performance of one of the leading automated blood tests for Alzheimer’s Disease, plasma p-tau217, in patients with mild symptoms undergoing assessment in a specialist memory service. 148 patients attending Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) generously donated blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples at the time of their LP, enabling researchers to directly compare new blood tests to established CSF biomarkers. Crucially, this was performed using fully-automated technology (Lumipulse®), which already exists in clinical diagnostic laboratories. The use of a fully-automated system increases reliability over time in the laboratory as well as reliability between different laboratories. The Trinity College study was a collaboration between the Immunology Department at St James’s Hospital (led by Chief Medical Scientist Dr Jean Dunne & Consultant Immunologist Professor Niall Conlon) and the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition at Tallaght University Hospital (Dr Adam Dyer, Specialist Registrar in Geriatric Medicine & Professor Seán Kennelly, Director). The study found that measuring plasma p-tau217 using a fully-automated system, was >90% as accurate as results obtained from LP. Integrating the blood test into clinical pathways could potentially avoid the need for over half of diagnostic LPs. This has clear implications for the diagnosis and management of early Alzheimer Disease. From their results, the research team believe that this new blood test could replace over half of the 150-200 diagnostic LP procedures that they currently carry out in the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition every year. Dr Jean Dunne, Chief Medical Scientist, Department of Immunology, St James’s Hospital and Trinity Translational Medicine Institute (TTMI) said: 'This blood test is not available currently in Ireland and the findings from this research will lend support to making it available in the future. This ‘translation’ from a research to a diagnostic test is dependent on the scientists, the clinical teams and the support from hospital management. Using this automated analyser the scientists at St James’s will be able to deliver a reliable and reproducible diagnostic test result. The quality assurance carried out in the diagnostic laboratory includes comparison of results achieved to those reported internationally. All of this research will benefit the patient and the clinical teams and combines the research and diagnostic expertise to deliver a world class, patient centred service.' Dr Adam Dyer, Specialist Registrar in Geriatric Medicine & Clinical Lecturer in Medical Gerontology, Trinity College Dublin said: 'This study brings us one step closer to using diagnostic blood tests, such as plasma p-tau217, to assist in the clinical-biological diagnosis of early Alzheimer’s Disease. Importantly, this research assessed plasma p-tau217 using fully-automated technology already available in clinical laboratories and used samples from a 'real-world' clinical cohort. We are incredibly grateful to the 148 patients who contributed to this research by donating their blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples at time of their diagnostic workup in the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition.' Professor Seán Kennelly, Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition in Tallaght University Hospital & Clinical Associate Professor, Trinity College Dublin, said: 'Our research, conducted in collaboration with colleagues from Trinity College Dublin and St. James Hospital Dublin, represents a further significant step forward in the early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. By demonstrating the clinical utility of blood-based biomarkers, we are moving closer to a future where diagnosing this condition is less invasive, more accessible, and available to a broader population. This has the potential to transform patient care, allowing for better diagnosis, earlier interventions and more targeted treatments. At the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition, we are extremely grateful to all our patients who contributed to this project, and remain committed to advancing research that improves the lives of those affected by Alzheimer’s and other cognitive disorders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm1-Hzuf4i5kwW	2025-02-14T15:48:44-08:00	
Aortic Dissection: Origin, Causes, Precautions And Treatment – Op...	An aortic dissection is a serious medical condition in which the inner layer of the aorta (the large blood vessel that branches off the heart) tears. Blood surges through the tear, causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate (dissect). If the blood-filled channel ruptures through the outer wall of the aorta, it can result in life-threatening bleeding. In the body the aorta is composed of three layers: Intima (inner layer), Media (middle layer) and Adventitia (outer layer). It typically begins with a tear in the intima. The high-pressure blood flow within the aorta forces its way into the media, creating a false lumen, which can lead to: Rupture of the aorta. Impaired blood flow to organs. Increased strain on the heart. a. Causes: Chronic Conditions: Hypertension (high blood pressure): The most common contributing factor. Atherosclerosis: Hardening of the arteries. Genetic Disorders: Marfan syndrome: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Trauma, and Blunt chest trauma (e.g., car accidents). Iatrogenic Causes: Complications from medical or surgical procedures, such as cardiac catheterization or aortic surgery. Other Factors: Cocaine or stimulant abuse: Increases blood pressure dramatically. Pregnancy: Rarely, due to hormonal and hemodynamic changes. Bicuspid aortic valve or coarctation of the aorta. b. Symptoms: Symptoms of an aortic dissection depend on its location and severity but often include: Pain: Sudden, severe chest or upper back pain. Described as tearing, ripping, or stabbing. Pain may radiate to the neck, jaw, or abdomen. Signs of Compromised Blood Flow: Weak or absent pulses in the arms or legs. Difference in blood pressure between the arms. c. Neurological Symptoms: Fainting. Stroke-like symptoms if blood flow to the brain is reduced. d. Other Symptoms: Shortness of breath. Sweating. Nausea or vomiting. Difficulty speaking or swallowing (rare but possible). Aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring immediate diagnosis and treatment. It is often confirmed through imaging tests such as a CT scan, MRI, or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Diet and Precautions Proper management of aortic dissection involves lifestyle changes, including a heart-healthy diet and strict adherence to precautions to prevent complications. A diet focused on controlling blood pressure and maintaining heart health is essential. Below are the key dietary guidelines: a. Low-Sodium Diet: Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg/day (ideally 1,500 mg/day). Avoid processed and canned foods, which are often high in salt. Use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt. b. Heart-Healthy Foods: Fruits and Vegetables: Rich in potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure (e.g., bananas, oranges, spinach, and broccoli). Whole Grains: Choose oats, brown rice, quinoa, and whole-grain bread. Healthy Fats: Focus on unsaturated fats like those in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. Lean Proteins: Include fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel), skinless poultry, and plant-based proteins like lentils and beans. Low-Fat Dairy: Opt for low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese. c. Other diet guideline include: Limit Saturated and Trans Fats: Avoid fried foods, fatty cuts of meat, butter, and processed snacks. Use alternatives like olive oil or canola oil for cooking. Reduce Added Sugars: Avoid sugary drinks, desserts, and sweets. Limit consumption of refined carbohydrates like white bread and pasta. Moderate Alcohol Intake: Limit alcohol consumption to 1 drink per day for women and 2 for men, if permitted by your doctor. Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to support overall cardiovascular health. Precautions: Blood Pressure Management: Keep blood pressure strictly within the target range prescribed by your doctor (often d. Avoid Stimulants: Stay away from caffeine, nicotine, and drugs like cocaine, which can raise blood pressure. d. Prevent Infections: Maintain good oral hygiene to reduce the risk of infections that could affect the heart or blood vessels. Get vaccinated as recommended (e.g., flu, pneumonia). e. Maintain a Healthy Weight: Achieve and maintain a body weight within a healthy range to reduce cardiovascular strain. f. Quit Smoking: Smoking damages blood vessels and increases the risk of further complications. Seek support to quit if needed. g. Emergency Preparedness: Be aware of symptoms like severe chest or back pain and seek immediate medical attention if they occur. By adhering to these dietary and lifestyle measures, patients with aortic dissection can reduce the risk of complications and improve overall outcomes. Advancements and future treatment The treatment of aortic dissection has evolved significantly with technological and medical innovations. Research is ongoing to develop safer, more effective, and less invasive methods for managing this life-threatening condition. Current Advancements include: a.Endovascular Repair (TEVAR):Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR): A minimally invasive procedure where a stent-graft is inserted via a catheter to reinforce the damaged section of the aorta. Particularly effective for Type B dissections (involving the descending aorta). Advantages: Shorter recovery time, reduced risk of complications, and lower mortality compared to open surgery. b. Hybrid Procedures: Combine open surgical techniques and endovascular repair to treat complex cases, particularly for Type A dissections (involving the ascending aorta and arch). Useful in cases where conventional TEVAR alone may not suffice. c. Advanced Imaging Techniques: High-resolution CT angiography, MRI, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) improve the diagnosis, monitoring, and surgical planning. 4D flow MRI tracks blood flow dynamics in real-time, helping predict areas at risk of rupture. d. Improved Surgical Techniques: Modern open surgical approaches, like the Bentall procedure or David valve-sparing procedure, offer better outcomes with reduced risks. Use of bioengineered or synthetic grafts for repairing the aorta is now more durable and biocompatible. e. Medical Management Enhancements: Newer antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), more effectively lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the aorta. Advances in anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory therapies reduce risks in chronic dissection cases. Future Directions: a.Personalized Medicine: Genetic testing for conditions like Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome may allow for earlier detection and targeted treatments. Tailored therapies based on patient-specific risk factors, anatomy, and genetic profiles. b. Bioengineered Grafts and Stents: Development of grafts and stents that adapt to the patient’s anatomy and promote natural healing of the aorta. Use of drug-eluting stents to reduce inflammation and scar tissue.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-AxVBoCMm6bzdeg1qAiu3	2025-02-14T15:45:15-08:00

CAF In The Baltics: A Test Of Strength And Strategy – Analysis	The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)-led Latvia Multinational Brigade (MNB-LVA) recently completed its first major field training exercises in a resolute show of NATO deterrence and collective defence in the face of rising tensions and uncertainty about Russia’s long term intentions. However, with the CAF grappling with significant structural challenges, many NATO allies are seeking reassurance from Canada about its ability to uphold its commitments as a reliable leader during periods of geopolitical instability. With war drums beating on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the Baltics, Canada, under Operation REASSURANCE, has set about playing a leading role in the Latvia Multinational Brigade [MNB-LVA], a group consisting of detachments from 13 NATO member states, which forms part of NATO’s 'Enhanced Forward Presence' (eFP) in the country. Canada first assumed the lead for the then battle group (BG) back in 2017, and NATO's strategic evolution to an 'Augmented Forward Presence' (aFP) has required transitioning from a battle group to a brigade (BDE) structure, significantly expanding Canada’s commitments. This is an ongoing process, with full operational capability (FOC) targeted for 2026. Significant issues in procurement and maintenance But this shift presents numerous challenges. The CAF faces structural personnel shortages and training gaps, both of which hinder its ability to meet expanded operational demands. Interoperability with the diverse forces of allied nations further complicates operations, requiring enhanced coordination and integration. Additionally, the transition demands substantial investments in equipment to meet NATO standards and operational expectations. Persistent issues around accurately estimating needs and costs exacerbate these challenges, as does the CAF’s limited human resources capacity. Colonel Vince Kirstein, Commander of Task Force Latvia, acknowledged the CAF’s limitations in this regard, noting, 'Canada does not have some of those capabilities that would inherently be required in a brigade.' A 2018 article by a serving army officer highlighted significant issues with Canada’s Leopard 2 tank fleet. At the time, only 15 to 20% of the fleet was operational, with the potential to increase to 30% with substantial effort. The article attributed these problems to a critical underestimation of the maintenance needs for the Leopard 2 tanks. Maintenance estimates had been based on experience with the simpler Leopard C1 from the earlier Leopard 1 series, leading to inadequate preparation for the more complex demands of Leopard 2. Additional challenges compounded the issue, including a lack of qualified maintenance personnel, insufficient dedicated infrastructure for tank upkeep and overhaul, and chronic shortages of spare parts. This scarcity often led to the cannibalisation of some tanks to keep others operational, further diminishing the fleet’s effectiveness. In early June 2023, shortly before Defence Minister Anita Anand announced the deployment of 15 Leopard 2 tanks to Latvia, CBC News published an article revealing another layer of equipment shortages faced by Canadian troops. According to the report, soldiers stationed in Latvia were purchasing their own modern ballistic helmets with integrated hearing protection, along with rain gear, vests, and belts to carry water and ammunition. The article also highlighted growing complaints about poorly fitting body armour for female soldiers. 'In general, it was concerning verging on embarrassing to see the differences in issued soldier equipment between us and the Danes,' said Lt.-Col. Jesse van Eijk, the Canadian battle group commander in Latvia, in a May 12, 2023 email as reported by CBC News. This trend of soldiers turning to commercial suppliers for higher-quality clothing and equipment is unsurprising, given the often superior options available on the market. In response to the CBC report, a Department of National Defence spokesperson acknowledged these issues and stated that efforts were underway to introduce new helmets, combat clothing, boots, and other gear in the near future. eFP equipment needs As Canada transitions its NATO commitment from eFP to aFP, addressing equipment needs has become a critical challenge. While some requirements are covered under Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) and receive appropriate funding (see Portable Anti-Tank Missile Systems and Counter-Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (CUAS), significant gaps remain—particularly in artillery capabilities, which are essential for large-scale state-on-state conflicts like those involving Russian forces. Artillery is a glaring, unfunded priority for the Canadian Army. The UORs are also seeking to procure up to twenty 155mm self-propelled howitzers, along with essential resupply equipment and ammunition. However, these plans remain unfulfilled. Canada’s current inventory of M777 towed artillery systems, which demonstrated their relevance in counterinsurgency operations against adversaries lacking comparable capabilities (a situation referred to by the military as asymmetry), is simply not suited to the context of high-intensity conflicts. Modernisation efforts need to prioritise platforms that offer both survivability and operational effectiveness on the battlefield, and in sufficient quantities to withstand loss rates that the CAF has not experienced since WWII. Major-General Rob Dundon highlighted the ongoing debate over stock replenishment versus replacement, indicating that decisions regarding long-term capability upgrades are still unresolved. Many options are on the table, including the paradoxical one—given its unsuitability to the operational realities of facing Russia—of reopening BAE's production lines for the M777, but such a move would require significant international demand to justify its profitability, an unlikely prospect. Each option presents unique challenges and trade-offs in terms of cost, timeline, and operational effectiveness. Potential solutions and interoperability testing in Latvia The CAF face significant uncertainty about how to address these critical equipment and capability gaps in the Baltic region. However, leveraging the deployment in Latvia for testing new systems could offer valuable insights. Platforms like the K9 Thunder heavy tracked artillery or CAESAR truck-mounted howitzers—already fielded, either by Estonia or Lithuania—are potential candidates for future CAF acquisitions. These systems align with NATO standards, some of them have been successfully battle proven in Ukraine and could address Canada’s persistent artillery shortages. General Joe Paul, Commander of the Canadian Army, described the Baltic theatre as an 'amazing laboratory' for refining tactics and testing equipment. The lessons learned from operating within a multinational brigade environment could heavily influence future doctrine and procurement decisions. This collaborative setup allows Canada to evaluate not only its own capabilities but also how its systems integrate with those of its allies. Interoperability, however, presents its own challenges. Effective coordination across Slovak, Polish, and Canadian forces, for instance, requires harmonising artillery and fire support doctrines. Differences in procedures and equipment can lead to significant risks during live operations. Major Matt Stickland, 1 RCHA Battery Commander, underscored the potential for mistakes, emphasising the catastrophic consequences of miscommunication or procedural mismatches during combat. 'It has been a challenge to make sure we have a common understanding. While there are NATO TTPs and STANAGS (standardization agreements) for everything we do within the artillery, sometimes the interpretation of these by different counties in their language makes a difference,' he said. 'With artillery, those differences in procedures when you are shooting a round 20 kilometres down range can have a big impact on making sure that round lands on target.' Testing allied systems like the K9 Thunder and CAESAR would also provide critical data for Canada’s Indirect Fire Modernisation project. This initiative aims to replace the aging M777 towed artillery with more agile, modern platforms capable of withstanding high-intensity conflicts. Such testing in Latvia would directly contribute to identifying solutions that enhance both operational readiness and compatibility with NATO standards. The deployment in Latvia highlights the CAF’s pressing equipment and personnel challenges. Addressing these issues requires a dual focus: investing strategically in modernisation and leveraging interoperability testing with NATO allies. By aligning its systems and practices with those of allied forces, Canada can ensure greater operational effectiveness in the Baltic region. Success hinges on closing gaps in artillery capabilities and refining joint operations to maintain credibility and readiness in an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PI9NN1UtASiM	2025-02-13T17:38:07-08:00	
Blackout Nation: How Myanmar’s Energy Crisis Is Crippling Lives –...	By Htet Khaing Min In Myanmar, darkness no longer just falls after sunset—it has become an everyday reality, an uninvited guest that lingers well beyond nightfall. Key Takeaways: Severe Power Shortages Cripple Myanmar – Blackouts for up to 20 hours disrupt businesses, healthcare, and daily life, worsening economic hardships. Gas Dependency and Infrastructure Damage – Failing gas plants, stalled solar projects, and grid attacks force reliance on costly alternatives. Urgent Reforms Needed – Expanding renewables, repairing infrastructure, and improving governance are crucial for energy stability. As the country grapples with one of its most severe power shortages in decades, the lights of progress have flickered and dimmed under the shadow of the military junta's regime. With rolling blackouts, widespread infrastructure damage, and a fractured power grid, Myanmar's citizens find themselves in the dark—literally and figuratively. Widespread socio-economic challenges, including higher household expenses, job losses, business closures, disruptions in education and healthcare, rising poverty, and long-term economic and environmental damage, are growing due to persistent power shortages. This article examines the causes and far-reaching consequences of Myanmar’s energy crisis, offering insights into the political, social, and economic toll it continues to exact on the nation. 1. Background of Myanmar Power Industry Over the past decade, Myanmar's power industry has experienced notable growth, followed by an abrupt decline following the 2021 military coup. Between 2015 and 2021, Myanmar saw significant strides in electricity generation and electrification. The country's energy infrastructure expanded with foreign direct investment (FDI) support and progressive government policies like the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan 2018-2030. The total installed power capacity grew from 5,125 MW to 6,830 MW, while power output increased from 15,965 GWh to 23,643 GWh annually. Gas-fired power plants like Thaketa Power Plant (400 MW), Thanlyin Power Plant (350 MW), and Thilawa Power Project (1,250 MW, expected online in 2024) were developed, and the electrification rate surged, benefiting both urban and rural areas. However, the 2021 military coup marked the beginning of a rapid decline in Myanmar’s electricity production. Major foreign investors exited the market, conflicts disrupted infrastructure, and economic instability set in, bringing the country's energy growth to a halt. These disruptions have since spiraled into one of the worst power crises in Myanmar’s history, one that continues to have far-reaching social and economic implications. 2. Brief Situation of Power Resources In a crisis, Myanmar’s energy sector faces widespread disruptions affecting all primary power sources. As demand outpaces supply, the country’s energy infrastructure faces mounting challenges. Let’s take a closer look at the current state of power resources. 2.1 Natural Gas: Declining Dominance Once the backbone of Myanmar’s power generation, supplying 55% of Myanmar’s electricity in 2022, natural gas generation has plummeted due to supply shortages and investor exits post-2021. Foreign companies like Voltalia, Posco, Total Energies, Chevron, and VPower ceased their operations due to political instability, ethical concerns, economic mismanagement, security risks, and financial losses, further weakening the energy sector. The shutdown of VPower’s Thilawa (350 MW) and Thaketa (400 MW) LNG plants in July 2021 resulted in a 1,200 MW capacity loss. Gas-fired plants operate below capacity, dropping efficiency from 17% in 2023 to 19% in 2022. State-owned plants struggle with rationing, while private facilities receive priority. 2.2. Hydropower: Overuse and Declining Efficiency Hydropower, accounting for 43.4% of the country's electricity in 2022 and almost 62% in 2023, has become the fallback as gas declines. Despite an estimated 100,000 MW potential, installed capacity remains at only 3,262 MW. Major plants like Yeywa (790 MW) and Shweli-1 (400 MW) are disrupted by conflicts and transmission damage. The Baluchaung cascade plants (243 MW) are in decline, with Baluchaung 1 and 3 no longer operational. Overuse has stressed water resources, causing seasonal fluctuations. The Nation’s heavy reliance on hydropower leads to severe electricity shortages during the dry season when water levels drop, reducing generation capacity. In 2022, maintenance shutdowns of key hydropower units, declining gas production, and halted LNG imports worsenedpower cuts, highlighting the urgent need for energy diversification. 2.3. Solar: Limited Impact and Stalled Expansion Myanmar’s solar capacity is minimal, with only six operational plants generating 182 MW. Government efforts to scale up solar through IPP tenders have largely failed, with only 142 MW commissioned out of a planned 2,150 MW. Most projects post-2021 remain stalled or canceled. Even functional solar plants provideinconsistent generation and are limited to daylight hours. 2.4. Coal: Minimal Contribution, Environmental Concerns Coal power remains marginal at 0.5% of total generation, with just two operational plants (138 MW). Myanmar has 488.7 million tons of coal reserves, yet only 1% has been confirmed, limiting its immediate contribution to the energy mix despite the potential. Environmental concerns have stalled coal expansion, with coal-related emissions accounting for 5.1% of total power sector emissions in 2022. 2.5. Power Grid: Conflict and Infrastructure Decay The national grid has suffered 229 attacks since 2021, severely disrupting transmission. In early 2025, power generation fell below 2,000 MW per day, far from the 4,400 MW demand. Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyidaw endure blackouts lasting 5-20 hours daily. Power distribution remains unequal, with Yangon receiving 48%, Mandalay 17%, and the rest of the country 35%. 2.6. Mini-Grids: Rural Electrification at Risk Developed under the National Electrification Plan (NEP), 73 mini-grids serve22,500 households and 15,800 public facilities. However, sustainability is threatened by conflicts, theft, and soaring fuel costs, which have tripled since 2021. Fixed tariffs fail to cover operational expenses, causing financial distress for operators and frequent outages for rural communities. 2.7 Worsening Current Nationwide Power Shortage As of early 2025, Myanmar’s power generation has plunged to around 2,800 MW daily, meeting just 50-55% of demand. Peak output sometimes drops below 2,000 MW, causing severe blackouts—up to 20 hours daily in major cities like Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyidaw. Rural and conflict-affected areas face near-constant outages. In Yangon, power cuts begin as early as 1 AM, with electricity available for only eight hours daily. Businesses and households increasingly rely on solar panels, charcoal stoves, and generators, further straining the economy and infrastructure. Recently, on 5th February 2025, Thailand cut power to Myanmar scam compounds linked to forced labor and fraud. Still, some remain operational using generators and satellite internet, while diplomatic efforts with China and Myanmar aim to curb these crimes. 3. Socioeconomic Impacts As a result, this persistent power shortage has caused severe socio-economic repercussions across Myanmar at every level. Household Hardships: Families face cooking, water access, and refrigeration issues, raising daily expenses. Job Losses: Power outages force businesses to cut operations, leading to unemployment, especially in industrial zones. Business Struggles: High generator costs raise production expenses, forcing some factories to shut down. Education & Healthcare Disruptions: Schools and hospitals struggle without stable electricity, affecting learning and medical services. Transportation Disruptions: Power shortages limit CNG supply, reducing public transport availability. Rising Poverty: Limited electricity reduces income opportunities, increases living costs, and hinders progress in education and healthcare. Long-Term Damage: Development slows, investment declines, and reliance on unreliable energy sources worsens environmental and health risks. 4. Junta's Mitigation Action Fell Short In response to the crisis, the military junta has attempted short-term fixes like infrastructure repairs and LNG projects, but sanctions and technical issues have slowed progress. Hydropower overuse has worsened water shortages, reducing capacity. Long-term plans for new hydro and solar plants remain stalled, with pre-coup projects largely unfulfilled. Despite doubling electricity tariffs, revenue has not improved power generation or grid stability. On the other hand, the National Unity Government (NUG)'s ability to address Myanmar’s energy crisis in liberated areas is hindered by the ongoing fragmentation among resistance forces, the lack of participation from key ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), and the challenge of establishing inclusive, accountable governance systems necessary for sustainable energy infrastructure. 5. Future Prospects and Consequences The power crisis persists without addressing these governance inefficiencies and investing in renewables, threatening severe economic, social, and political consequences. Economically, industrial output will decline as businesses face high costs of diesel generators, deterring foreign investment. Socially, the crisis will disrupt healthcare, education, and water supply, worsening poverty and inequality. The country's infrastructure and economic systems may suffer lasting damage, reversing years of progress. Politically, the junta's failure to address the crisis could fuel public dissatisfaction and civil unrest, deepening instability and challenging its legitimacy, further exacerbating Myanmar's decline. 6. Mitigation Plan To address this alarming crisis, Myanmar must adopt a multi-pronged approach. The immediate priority is the restoration of infrastructure, focusing on repairing damaged transmission lines and rehabilitating key gas plants. Expanding renewable energy sources, particularly solar, wind, and hydropower, is crucial for reducing the nation’s dependency on gas and mitigating future power shortages. Moreover, Myanmar’s energy policy must be reformed to attract foreign investment and improve governance. An independent Energy Regulatory Commission could ensure transparency, boost investor confidence, and combat corruption. Strengthening the financial management of the energy sector will also be vital for sustainable growth. In the longer term, Myanmar should explore regional energy cooperation, particularly with neighboring countries like Laos and Thailand, to ease supply constraints and expand the grid. For instance, Laos and Myanmar are advancing a 2024 MOU on power cooperation to supply 300-400 MW via northern grids. Still, past struggles with domestic energy projects and ongoing feasibility studies will determine pricing and implementation within two years. Mini-grids and decentralized solutions must be prioritized to ensure that rural areas continue to have access to reliable energy. Ultimately, political stability is key to the success of any energy reform. Without a return to peace and stability, foreign investments, technical expertise, and infrastructure improvements will remain out of reach, prolonging Myanmar’s energy crisis.

Breaking The Cycle Of Old Politics In Sri Lanka – Analysis	By Neil DeVotta Sri Lanka’s 2024 elections have ushered in a seismic shift, with Anura Kumara Dissanayake (often known by his initials ‘AKD’) of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) becoming president in September 2024 and the JVP-led National People’s Power (NPP) alliance winning a parliamentary supermajority in November 2024. The two elections represent a political realignment, empowering a new class of elites while marginalising long-dominant politicians. The Marxist-Leninist JVP was responsible for two bloody insurrections in 1971 and 1987-89 that killed tens of thousands of Sri Lankans. This violent past was long an electoral albatross, but creating the NPP alliance with twenty other groups helped transform the JVP into a more conventional left-leaning party. AKD’s winning personality and articulate, rational discourse held sway over now former Sri Lankan president Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in the presential election. Educated professionals who contested for the NPP in the parliamentary election further softened the JVP’s prior radical image. The splintered opposition also helped. But the main reason for AKD’s and the NPP’s victories was the island’s bankruptcy. The alliance effectively linked the resulting economic crisis to the corruption, nepotism and impunity of previous regimes and promised more accountable and transparent governance. Systemic change requires that Sri Lanka’s political structure and political culture must now be transformed. The NPP has promised a new constitution, which could appreciably change the political system. But transforming the political culture would require weakening ethnocracy in ways that may sideline powerful constituencies like the military and Buddhist clergy. A new political culture would also require accountability for crimes committed by security personnel — often hailed as war heroes —against Tamils, journalists and detractors of the former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family. Few minorities voted for Dissanayake, but many voted for the NPP. The NPP is the first political grouping from the predominantly Sinhalese south to win Tamil and Muslim districts in the northeast. Both the presidential and parliamentary elections took place without the ethnoreligious dog whistles of the past, helping the NPP bridge the ethnoreligious divide. Post-election, the government has embarked on a three-pronged development plan — eliminating poverty, creating a digital economy and a Clean Sri Lanka initiative which emphasises anti-corruption and the rule of law to resuscitate the island’s environment, ethics and culture. It has also promised to recruit more Tamils into the police force and return additional Tamil lands — long occupied by the military — to their original owners. Such measures could help AKD and the NPP strengthen their appeal among minorities. To ensure stability, the new government agreed to stick with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout and completed the sovereign debt restructuring agreement spearheaded by the Wickremesinghe regime, despite the NPP wanting to renegotiate both. NPP supporters who vilify the IMF and neoliberalism have been disappointed, but the government had little choice. In any case, the NPP is not the JVP. And the new elite, while left-leaning, are products of the island’s post-1977 open market milieu. The JVP’s Marxist dogma has also long lapsed. Since AKD’s election, tourism has ramped up and the stock market is at its highest level yet. The IMF has also approved its third review of the US$2.9 billion bailout, which will add US$333 million to government coffers. Yet the euphoria has subsided and the NPP is struggling to meet expectations. Farmers protest for not receiving sufficient assistance and many people complain about the cost of living — especially coconut and rice prices. This is an inexperienced government, which partly explains it disagreement with bureaucrats for supposedly stymying reform efforts. The JVP used to emphasise the dangers of Indian expansionism and the party was among the most anti-Indian groups in Sri Lankan politics. But its leaders have gradually changed their attitude, as reiterated when Dissanayake made a successful visit to India in December 2024. The government is committed to pursuing a neutral foreign policy, consistent with claims made by previous leaders — even if Mahinda Rajapaksa tilted toward China and Ranil Wickremesinghe toward the West. Most proposed Indian investment projects are designed to facilitate connectivity between the two countries. But Sri Lanka’s politicians worry whether India’s strong geostrategic position could lead to dependence and undermine the island’s sovereignty. Yet it makes sense for the country to try and piggyback on the growing economic development in South India. India cannot afford an estranged neighbour to its south — not with a hostile Pakistan, the pro-India regime in Bangladesh being ousted, Nepal reviving the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) or China spreading its influence throughout the region. Sri Lanka will have some leverage when engaging its giant neighbour. The JVP’s origins are also rooted in Maoism and Dissanayake visited China in January 2025. In a dozen of many interviews with people close to the matter over the last decade, I have been told that money from Chinese and Indian sources has been channelled towards political parties in Sri Lanka. China has most likely supported the party financially and it wants to further its BRI via Sri Lanka. Dissanayake’s team signed 15 Memorandums of Understanding with their Chinese counterparts , including a US$3.7 billion oil refinery project in Hambantota that will ensure more Chinese shipping entered the region’s port. The government’s challenge will be to balance China’s BRI designs with India’s Neighbourhood First agenda. The NPP’s election manifesto promised Sri Lankans ‘a thriving nation [and] a beautiful life’. It will be a long time in the making. If Dissanayake and the NPP can avoid scandals while pursuing policies — both domestic and foreign — that improve the island’s economy, they will stay relatively popular and at least provide Sri Lankans a dignified life in the years ahead.

Rising Rates May Trigger Financial Instability, Complicating Figh...	Before the pandemic, investors worried about how persistently low inflation and interest rates would crimp bank profits. Paradoxically, they also worried about bank profitability when post-COVID reopening sent inflation and central bank interest rates soaring. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and other US lenders in early 2023 appeared to validate these fears. Our new research on the relationship between inflation and bank profitability helps us make sense of these concerns. Most banks are largely insulated from shifts in inflation—the exposure of income and expenses tend to offset each other. Yet some have significant inflation exposures, which may lead to financial instability if concentrated losses lead to wider panics in the banking sector. As several major central banks are reassessing their monetary policy frameworks in the aftermath of the post-pandemic inflation surge, a deeper understanding of the links between inflation and bank profitability can help design better monetary policy frameworks. Our findings imply that central banks may need to consider financial stability when setting their policy stance to combat inflation. Inflation matters Does inflation matter for bank profitability? This question has received surprisingly little attention. We answer it by combining balance sheet and income data for more than 6,600 banks in advanced and emerging economies with nearly three decades of IMF economic data. Most lenders appear largely hedged against inflation with both bank income and expenses rising with inflation to similar degrees. Income and expenses tied to borrowing and lending are exposed indirectly to inflation, because they primarily react to policy rates that fluctuate in response to inflation. In contrast, other income and expenses—revenues from non-traditional banking activities, services, salaries, and rent—are exposed directly to price changes. At the country level, the impact of inflation on bank income and expenses individually varies widely across banking systems. Shifts in inflation are reflected in income and expenses much more rapidly in some countries than in others. But, again, since both income and expenses rise with inflation to similar degrees in most countries, most banking systems appear largely hedged to inflation. Concentrated exposures So, can inflation be a cause for concern? Our research identifies specific vulnerabilities: some banks are particularly susceptible to inflation due to different risk management and business models. Outliers in both advanced and emerging market and developing economies stand to see large losses when inflation and interest rates spike. Strikingly, 3 percent of banks in advanced economies and 6 percent of banks in emerging economies are at least as exposed to elevated interest rates as Silicon Valley Bank at the onset of its failure. Banks in emerging economies also appear more exposed to inflation directly, possibly due to more widespread price indexation. Policy implications Amid high inflation, tightening monetary policy, while necessary, could lead to meaningful losses for banks with large exposures. Customers and investors may then reassess risks across all banks, which could lead to panics and financial instability. Strengthening prudential regulation and supervision, heightening required risk management at banks, improving transparency, and using granular risk assessments accounting for key factors our research highlights for a broad set of banks would all help to systematically contain inflation exposures. Despite these improvements, if losses at individual banks leave room for wider contagion, central banks may need to balance raising rates to contain inflation against the potential for financial instability.

Resettling Gaza: Trump’s Empire-Building Agenda? – Analysis	In his signature style, President Donald Trump has doubled down on his vision for the future of Gaza, suggesting that the United States could assume control of the embattled territory once hostilities subside. Speaking on December 6, Trump outlined a plan in which Israel would transfer the Gaza Strip to U.S. oversight, emphasizing that the move would involve resettling Palestinians into what he described as 'far safer and more beautiful communities' across the region. Notably, he assured that no American troops would be required to execute this vision. The proposal, however, has sparked immediate backlash. Critics have accused Trump of endorsing a form of ethnic cleansing, a charge vehemently denied by his administration. The United Nations, human rights organizations, and Arab leaders have condemned the idea, while analysts remain skeptical of its feasibility. Trump’s initial remarks, made during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, framed Gaza’s transformation into the 'Riviera of the Middle East' as a permanent shift. Yet, subsequent clarifications from his officials have painted a different picture, suggesting that any displacement would be temporary and would allow for reconstruction and debris clearance. The contradictions within Trump’s camp have only deepened the controversy. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Rubio both emphasized the interim nature of the plan, directly contradicting Trump’s earlier implications of permanence. Meanwhile, Trump’s post on Truth Social left key questions unanswered, particularly whether Gaza’s two million residents would eventually be permitted to return. Under international law, the forced transfer of populations from occupied territories is explicitly prohibited, adding another layer of complexity to Trump’s proposal. Trump’s vision, though ambitious, appears mired in legal, logistical, and ethical challenges, raising doubts about its viability. In advocating a prolonged U.S. occupation of Gaza and the expulsion of Palestinians, President Donald Trump is not only aligning himself with the far-right vision of Israel’s supremacist factions but also endorsing what can only be described as a war crime. This stance betrays any commitment to peace he might have professed during his inaugural address. Trump, who took an oath to uphold the U.S. constitution, has now proposed on February 4 that the United States take control over Gaza under the pretext of reconstruction—a thinly veiled prelude to a predatory real estate venture that explicitly excludes Palestinians. Trump’s unwavering support for Israeli policies is well documented. His unilateral decisions, such as moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, thus recognizing the city as Israel’s capital, and legitimizing Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights, set a precedent during his first term (2017-2021). In advocating for the forceful displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, Trump has taken a significant step towards solidifying his alignment with the Israeli far-right. This segment of Israeli politics envisions the conflict in terms of absolute dominion and subjugation. Furthermore, Trump’s shocking announcement about Gaza might soon be followed by similar stances on the annexation of significant portions of the West Bank. By denying Palestinians their legitimate right to self-determination in the land that is rightfully theirs, Trump is essentially rewriting history to fit a narrative of dominance and control. This distortion of historical facts into a narrative of supremacy risks being endorsed as official policy by the world’s leading power. This trajectory must be halted. Peace is achievable only through compromise and mutual recognition, not through the oppression of a beleaguered people. The pursuit of such a catastrophic project would undoubtedly incite dangerous Israeli messianism, to the detriment of both sides. Trump is also disregarding how this announcement will affect the ongoing normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which hinge on the creation of a Palestinian state. The expressed refusal by Egypt and Jordan to be complicit in this proposed ethnic cleansing by taking in displaced Palestinians similarly falls on deaf ears. Trump appears convinced that the force he wields from the White House supersedes all other considerations. This conviction harkens back to the misadventures of another Republican administration in the wake of 9/11, which saw the United States engage in disastrous military endeavors across the Middle East. The resulting damage to America’s global standing, the loss of countless lives, and the squandering of vast resources were all counterproductive to the intended outcomes. Trump entered the political arena a decade ago by criticizing these very missteps, yet now he champions a form of neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism that demands a physical presence in foreign lands. Far from restoring America’s greatness, as he claims, Trump risks dragging the nation back into a bloody quagmire from its past. The public sentiment in Arab countries has been overwhelmingly negative towards the plan. Many perceive it as an imperialistic act that negates Palestinian self-determination and threatens regional stability. The geopolitical consequences of this proposal are likely to be severe. The displacement of Palestinians could ignite riots and violence, not just in Gaza, but throughout the Middle East. Countries in the region are already grappling with socio-economic challenges and political risks, and may not be able to manage the additional burden of displaced Palestinians. Moreover, this plan could strain relations between the United States and key Middle Eastern allies. Strategic partners like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan might reconsider their diplomatic ties with the United States if it pursues such a policy. The broader Muslim world, including Turkey and Iran, would likely amplify their objections to America’s role in the region. The challenges of implementing such a transformation are immense, even though Trump envisions Gaza as an economic hub. Relocating more than 1.8 million people is not feasible. Neighboring countries, already dealing with their own economic and political issues, are unlikely to open their borders to such an influx. The lack of options for the Palestinians exacerbates the situation. Furthermore, security risks would deter investors, even if the land were cleared for redevelopment. Transforming Gaza economically would require substantial foreign investment, but the displacement of its population would discourage many international businesses. Yet, the cost of demolishing and rebuilding Gaza would be prohibitively high, necessitating immediate and long-term involvement from a reluctant if not openly hostile international community. Another significant issue is security. The evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza would provoke strong resistance from local militias and other regions and countries. Hamas and other militant groups would likely launch counterattacks, leading to further conflict. The U.S. control of Gaza would necessitate a sustained military presence, resulting in prolonged insurgency and terrorist activity. Past experiences of military occupations in volatile regions like Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that such interventions often lead to significant losses, financial strain, and long-term instability rather than successful outcomes. Trump’s proposal to seize the Gaza Strip and relocate its Palestinian residents raises numerous legal, ethical, and geopolitical questions. Mass deportation of people is not only a violation of international law but also a practice that could lead to further conflict and strained relations with other nations. Ultimately, any effort to address the Israeli-Palestinian issue must begin with the recognition of the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. A multilateral and sustainable approach, grounded in the principles of international law and involving all parties in the conflict, is essential for establishing lasting peace in the region.

Foreign Companies Driving The Global Privatization Of Domestic In...	Foreign entities have secured profitable positions in once-public domestic infrastructure. The pursuit of short-term cash has sacrificed long-term revenue streams to a variety of foreign investors. On February 4, 2025, Chicago's business community pushed back against Mayor Brandon Johnson's proposal to raise real estate transfer taxes, adding to the city's ongoing economic struggles. Besides a struggling pension fund, high home prices, and other factors, a significant contributor to the city's woes lies in the controversial privatization initiatives from the 2000s, known as the 'Great Chicago Sell-Off.' Over the past two decades, these decisions have siphoned an estimated $3 to $4 billion from Chicago. The privatization trend began under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, starting with the Chicago Skyway. In 2005, the 7.8-mile toll road was leased to a consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial and Australia's Macquarie Group for $1.83 billion. Tolls were raised immediately, and in 2016, the 99-year lease was sold to 'a trio of Canadian pension funds' (the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP)) for $2.8 billion. Australia's Atlas Arteria Ltd. then acquired a two-thirds stake for $2 billion in 2022, while OTTP retained the remainder. In 2006, four downtown parking garages with more than 9,000 spaces were leased for 99 years to Morgan Stanley for $563 million. After Morgan Stanley defaulted on its debt tied to the lease agreement, control was transferred in 2014 to lenders, including France's Societe Generale, the German government, and Italy's UniCredit S.p.A. In 2016, Australia's AMP Capital and Canada's Northleaf Capital Partners acquired the garages. Abu Dhabi came into the picture in 2008. In a $1.16 billion deal, 36,000 parking meters were sold to Chicago Parking Meters (CPM) LLC for 75 years, a consortium led by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley's Infrastructure group soon restructured CPM's ownership, transferring major stakes to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany's Allianz through complex investment vehicles. Over the next five years, parking fees more than doubled. By 2022, CPM recovered its entire $1.16 billion investment, while the city had spent $78.8 million buying back parking spots to cover the revenue it would have generated until 2084. As of 2024, the investment has returned $700 million, with 60 years left on the lease. Daley's goal was to balance the city's budget without raising property taxes before leaving office. However, the one-time payments resulted in long-term consequences. In addition to financial losses, the privatization deals have hindered Chicago's ability to modernize infrastructure by limiting efforts to build bike lanes and reduce car dependence downtown, and people even need to get permission or make payments to companies thousands of miles away for local street parades. Growing Privatization Profit-driven entities argue that privatizing public infrastructure leads to greater efficiency through expertise and investment. However, their focus is on profit maximization, not service improvement, leading to long-term rent-seeking behavior. Furthermore, in contracts with limited liability companies, the government assumes the losses, while private companies reap the profits. Companies can walk away or demand renegotiations, while governments are left to maintain services, absorb long-term revenue losses, and burden the public with higher costs. As Chicago's experience shows, privatization has extended beyond domestic markets to become an international phenomenon. Starting in the 1980s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank reforms encouraged the privatization of public infrastructure to attract investment, leading to its internationalization. 'A 2006 study by the Norwegian government of IMF conditionality revealed that 23 out of 40 poor countries still have privatization and liberalization conditions attached to their IMF loans,' stated an Oxfam Briefing Paper. By 2000, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and multinational corporations began treating infrastructure as a global asset class, involving extended leases that frequently change hands. Foreign companies operate under bilateral investment treaties or trade agreements, allowing them to bypass local courts. Disputes are often mediated in foreign courts or through international arbitration, such as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and the World Trade Organization. By exploiting legal loopholes like offshore subsidiaries and tax havens, companies can also shield profits while facing little public scrutiny. Despite these issues, domestic infrastructure continues to be increasingly available on international markets. United States While Chicago remains the most prominent American example, similar deals are widespread across the country, primarily involving companies from allied or dependent nations. In 1998, Atlanta became one of the first cities to enter into an international privatization deal over public services, signing a 20-year and $428 million contract with United Water, a subsidiary of France's corporate conglomerate Suez, to operate the city's water system. Celebrated as the biggest privatization contract in the U.S. at the time, it led to claims of quality decline, delays, and other mismanagement before the contract was terminated, leading to the infrastructure being returned to public control in 2003. Nonetheless, the trend continued. By 2006, foreign companies were leasing and operating 80 percent of U.S. port terminals along with a smaller share of the nation's airports. The UK's National Grid owns and operates electric transmission networks in the northeastern U.S. Indiana has since become a prominent example of experimenting with international privatization. France's Veolia entered a 20-year contract to manage Indianapolis's waterworks in 2002. The deal was, however, eventually canceled in 2010. Meanwhile, its airport was managed by Britain's BAA from 1994 to 2007. In 2006, the Indiana Toll Road was leased to a foreign consortium led by Spanish and Australian companies for 75 years for $3.8 billion. It was later sold for $5.7 billion to Australia's IFM Investors in 2015. United States entities have purchased some infrastructure abroad, such as in 1999, when a subsidiary of Bechtel privatized Cochabamba's water system in Bolivia before controversy forced its exit. But for a major economy, the U.S. owns surprisingly little foreign infrastructure. It has few state-owned enterprises for overseas infrastructure investment, though some private entities like Blackstone's Infrastructure Partners division and Corsair Capital are active. Instead, extensive domestic privatization opportunities have made U.S. infrastructure a prime target for American and foreign investors. Canadian and Australian Companies Canadian and Australian pension funds and other entities, driven by well-funded systems, consolidation, government support, and early privatization experience, have become major infrastructure investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. The CPPIB owns toll roads worldwide, the OTPP holds stakes in airports across Europe, along with the Channel Tunnel, while the Canadian company Brookfield Infrastructure Partners owns telecom infrastructure across Europe. Roughly half of Australia's pension pool is invested outside the country. But Australia's Macquarie Group, in particular, has seen its assets surge, emerging as the 'world's largest infrastructure asset manager.' Since the 1990s, Macquarie Group has focused on identifying underperforming or undervalued public assets to acquire and restructure, and it established its Global Infrastructure Fund in 2001 'to invest in infrastructure financing opportunities in the U.S., Canada, UK, and the European Union,' according to its website. In addition to Chicago's Skyway, Macquarie holds long-term operational licenses for the Dulles Greenway toll road in Virginia and the Foley Beach Expressway in Alabama, among others. Macquarie's toll road portfolio in India is worth an estimated $2 billion, and it took a 49 percent stake in Greece's largest utility, Public Power Corporation (PPC) in 2021. It also led the push for privatizing the UK's Bristol Airport in 2001, while Britain's largest water utility was sold to an international consortium led by Macquarie Group from 2006 to 2017. Macquarie also took full ownership of the UK's National Gas Network in 2023. According to a July 2023 Guardian article, 'Macquarie is well known for taking advantage of volatile markets. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it bet big on non-investment grade loans, known as junk debt. The debt was cheap, but the quality was decent and the returns turned out to be excellent.' Europe The UK has been a major market for infrastructure investors since the global wave of privatization in the 1980s. Beyond Macquarie's infrastructure holdings, the UK's largest electricity generation company was privatized and acquired by France's EDF in 2009. Foreign investors have continued to diversify, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) poised to take over Newcastle Airport, after acquiring a 37.6 percent stake in Heathrow with French co-investor Ardian in 2024. Europe's collective experience with infrastructure privatization has been marked by controversy, largely due to Western European corporate dominance. As the EU expanded, some Western EU companies bought control of critical infrastructure in Eastern EU member states. In 2015, Greece privatized 14 regional airports handing them over to a consortium led by the German company Fraport. This move was unpopular in Greece, especially following the austerity measures imposed by the EU and Germany during Greece's economic crisis. However, the EU also provides safeguards in such deals, including profit sharing and economic support to member states. Outside the EU, resolving disputes is even more challenging. French water companies like Veolia and Suez are leaders in global privatization efforts but have ended up in court over dealings with Argentina in the 1990s, Egypt in the 2000s, and Gabon in the 2010s. Argentina renationalized its oil company from Spanish company Repsol in 2012 after domestic backlash, damaging relations between the two countries. Such cases can be particularly sensitive when they involve former colonial powers and their former colonies, as economic disputes risk being seen as extensions of past dominance, with former ruling states accused of leveraging privatization to maintain influence. China China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) predominantly focuses on building infrastructure in non-Western countries, though the 2020 takeover of Laos' electric grid shows an exception. In contrast, Europe's existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China's COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021. China's competitive pricing, substantial financial and productive resources, and strategic interests have extended its infrastructure influence to countries with their own expansive foreign infrastructure portfolios. Chinese firms hold stakes in Belgian, Dutch, German, Spanish, and Italian ports, as well as European energy and telecommunications infrastructure. In Australia, the Port of Darwin was leased for 99 years in 2015 to China's Landbridge Group, with the Australian government resisting pressure to cancel the deal. The State Grid Corporation of China and its subsidiaries, meanwhile, hold large stakes in Australia's electricity and gas infrastructure, raising national security concerns due to its close ties to Chinese military and intelligence agencies. Furthermore, China's control over Australian agricultural land has granted it valuable water rights. The geopolitical implications of these foreign investments in infrastructure are undeniable, with national security concerns forcing China to sell its stake in the U.S. Port of Long Beach in 2019. Yet such investments are only becoming more common globally. While they may strengthen economic ties between countries, they reduce accountability, risk undermining sovereignty, and disconnect public services from local oversight, sidelining effective public planning in favor of enriching foreign entities. This trend appears likely to continue, requiring more responsible approaches to maintaining a healthy balance between the necessity for infrastructure investment and public needs. Shorter contracts, profit-sharing models, and performance-based agreements could help countries and companies showcase their development models and expertise—potentially even at lower costs than local providers. However, profit maximization remains the driving force, particularly when financial entities dominate the field. About the author: John P.

How We Distribute Power Will Influence Our Future – Analysis	As we head into a future shaped by climate change, we must find ways to stabilize societies and reduce conflict. Solutions may lie in the archaeological record. Power in human societies is often viewed as hierarchical, meaning that it's tiered and ranked. This view doesn't fully capture the complexity of how power is managed in different cultures. Some societies are not strictly hierarchical but heterarchical, where power is distributed among various groups or individuals who work together without a clear ranking. There is ample evidence for the existence of heterarchy for a variety of forms of social and political power, including in the archaeological record.1 Historically, the idea that more complex societies are superior to simpler ones has justified racism, colonialism, and domination. However, research conducted since the end of the 20th century increasingly shows that all human societies are fluid and interconnected, with power often shared among different groups. Understanding these power dynamics helps us see how societies change over time. For example, when an elite group loses control of trade, new power structures may emerge, such as guilds or associations. These changes affect the entire society and can lead to more distributed power and democratic institutions. The combined study of heterarchy and hierarchy allows us to trace how societies adapt and respond to challenges. It shows that power can shift and evolve into new forms of social organizations that help societies survive and thrive, even if they may face new tensions or conflicts later. A Closer Look At Authority Structures Heterarchies are self-organizing systems in which elements engage and affect one another. In the context of social systems, the relative power of groups can change based on the situation, which often depends on the degree of communication and collaboration among entities with different sources of power. When power is consolidated in a society by merging distinct entities (for example, religious, political, or economic) into a single, tightly controlled system (hyper-hierarchy or hypercoherence), there is less flexibility in dealing with surprise.2 The term polity is preferred to include the gamut of political organizations. Keep in mind that no polities are entirely hierarchical or heterarchical but instead are diverse and have changing packages of governance. For example, some organizations (armies, police, and firefighters) are necessarily quite hierarchical to clarify chains of command but can serve a polity in which all citizens have free access to health care. Hierarchical Polities Administrators in strong hierarchies (authoritarian states, oligarchies, and hyper-hierarchies) have several advantages. Due to a clear decision-making chain, they respond well to fast-developing crises (such as a military attack or insurrection). Because the rules and responsibilities are familiar, political interactions among decision-makers are fewer and more formalized, and political maintenance of the system is low. Administrative hierarchies are equipped with powerful security forces that can successfully defend the state perimeter and suppress internal dissent. Polities that are strongly hierarchical are at a disadvantage, however, because data-gathering techniques, tied to the pyramidal decision-making framework, slow or stop the arrival of important information (especially subversive activity) at the apex of the pyramid. This necessitates the formalization and elaboration of internal security forces. Decisions are not necessarily popular; dissatisfaction is high and there must be considerable investment in coercion or propaganda. This also leads to high security costs. An example of this can be seen in most military dictatorships. In Chile under Augusto Pinochet, for example, the regime held onto power through the systematic suppression of opposition parties and the persecution of dissidents. Heterarchical Polities Administrators in polities with a strong heterarchical organization receive good quality information from many sources within and outside the decision-making lattice. In general, decisions are fair and reflect popular consensus. Decision-makers hear of a variety of solutions to problems. Because heterarchies are more likely to value the contributions of disparate segments of the community (ethnic groups and women, for example), their society is better integrated and the workforce is proud and energized. Heterarchical polities are at a disadvantage because consensus is slow to achieve. Decision-makers must engage with constituents, requiring considerable time, energy, and constant maintenance. The cacophonous voices and choices a decision-maker hears complicate the search for workable solutions. The greater the groups' involvement and trust in the system, the greater the possibility of consensus, but the response time is slower, and long-range planning is more difficult. Trade-offs Heterarchies value spontaneity, flexibility, and a definition of state power that involves balancing diverse elements. Individuals gain status through merit (rather than through inheritance or loyalty). State power should be used to improve citizens' safety and well-being. Hierarchies, by contrast, value rule-based authority, rigid class lines linked to ascribed as well as achieved status and rank, a control definition of state power, and once achieved, the status quo. State democracies exhibit characteristics of both, which explains in part why they are more stable than authoritarian states. Key Issues for Future Research In all societies, the power of various individuals and factions fluctuates relative to changing circumstances. Today, as resources worldwide are being depleted and environmental conditions deteriorate, new ways to stabilize societies and reduce conflict must be found. One of the most important conditions for reducing conflict is to ensure inclusive and equitable conditions for everyone, particularly as regards food and water security, personal and group safety, and a satisfying quality of life. In human societies, heterarchy is a corrective to power theories that conflate hierarchy with (civil) order, thereby creating a conundrum: will you submit and be safe or resist at your peril? To reenvision an equitable future for humankind, there must be a means to conceptualize and evaluate shifts between exclusive and inclusive power relations in diverse spatial and temporal scales and contexts. There must also be a way to assess the implications of each type of relationship in terms of how beneficial it is to society and how suitable it is for the future. Created in the process of building nation-states around the globe, analytic tools that measure efficiency illuminate only hierarchical political, economic, and social forms and ignore the stabilizing power of heterarchical forms; in this way, hyper-hierarchical and other inherently unstable forms of wealth distribution and political power accumulate. The controlling model of hierarchy-as-order, ubiquitous and all but invisible, exacerbates growing tensions. Bioarchaeology as a Window to Political Relationships Public policies, systems of exchange, subsistence strategies, and social roles structure how people obtain resources and how they experience the result of toil and violence. Bioarchaeology (the scientific study of biological remains from archaeological sites) and genomics have become invaluable to the study of early political relationships. It is now possible to reconstruct many aspects of an individual's life by extracting DNA and evaluating trauma in human remains. In addition to much more reliable identification of sex and age at death, we can now know the region where a person was born, if they traveled widely or emigrated to another region, and we can find clues to what they ate, the kind of work they did, and how they were treated. Together these pieces of information can form a picture of life as lived, marking stressful and tranquil periods that the person and/or the group survived. These new tools produce reliable determinations of historic risk and vulnerability across various scales, from the individual level to large populations. While community-wide governance in smaller-sized groups is no surprise, this was also seen in cooperative states, regions, and urban agglomerations (Callejón de Huaylas/Requay, central Thailand, Mimbres, Tiawanaku, and Marroquíes) and even empires (Xianbei and Genghis Khan's Mongols) that were collaboratively organized.3 Future Thinking This is important information for the human future: the old paradigm that asserted competition and conflict to be the primary motors of civilization can now be reconsidered. In the course of human history, societies engaged in cooperative activities that advanced their well-being, and they also fell into conflict or under the rule of tyrants. If we begin with the premise that the tension between competition and cooperation exists in all human societies, it then behooves us to explore the ways rules and norms permit or deny each other, and how both interact with history and changing conditions to forge institutions.4 The political climates of the past demonstrate that human accomplishment is not on a rising staircase culminating in the state; instead, we find a long history of diverse experiments and their results, to which we now have access. In the contemporary world, we face an important question: How can the equity and effectiveness of coalitions, federations, leagues, unions, and communities in societies of all sizes help us construct and strengthen societies of the future?

When The Marketplace Of Ideas Goes Broke – OpEd	By David Volodzko Advocates of free speech champion it because they believe in the marketplace of ideas. The notion is that open discourse allows all perspectives to be heard and tested. When ideas are challenged, we cut through the clutter of bad thinking with the benefit of arguments sharpened by other minds. At least, that’s what the brochure says. But what happens when media bias, political propaganda, bot armies, troll farms, and deep fakes become so sophisticated that we can no longer trust our own eyes? What happens when the marketplace of ideas goes broke? When sunlight no longer disinfects? The easy solution is to censor the harmful things you don’t want to hear. But this raises two problems. First, whom do you entrust with such immense power? Who gets to determine the truth? Second, censorship doesn’t actually eliminate bad ideas but rather drives them underground—now with the dissident’s badge of respectability. The moment people are censored, we begin to wonder if they’re onto something. But if we feel that all views have been given due consideration, we’re more likely to trust the truth as it unfolds. Even when we agree, some truths must be tested and sharpened against the whetstone of rebuttal. In Areopagitica, John Milton argues that censorship prevents us from stress-testing bad ideas. If we’re worried about harmful lies, we need not restrict speech, he says, because if we simply let people talk freely, the truth will out. Over 150 years later, Thomas Jefferson echoed this sentiment in his first inaugural address, saying, 'Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.' But even if truth does not prevail, John Stuart Mill later argued, we still hone our critical faculties by engaging each other. In other words, you benefit by playing chess even when you lose. This tradition of thought was finally crystalized with the marketplace metaphor, first used by the Supreme Court in the 1919 case Abrams v. United States, in which the Court upheld the conviction of five Russian immigrants for handing out leaflets opposing US involvement in World War I. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., wrote, 'The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.' This turn of phrase was later rendered in its modern form by Justice William O. Douglas, who wrote in United States v. Rumely of a publisher who 'bids for the minds of men in the marketplace of ideas.' Recently on X, the political commentator Richard Hanania shared a list of the top podcasts in the United States—Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, and the 'Hawk Tuah' girl Haliey Welch. Hanania wrote, 'If you’re a smart person who believes in free speech, you need to have your eyes completely open as to the likely winners in a free marketplace of ideas. The next project for liberals is what to do about the fact that humans are this stupid.' Claire Lehmann, founder of Quillette magazine, replied, 'It’s not our job to police the entertainment of plebs. But it is our responsibility to build institutions which maintain high standards—& keep the riffraff out.' They’re both onto something. Hanania is correct that in a truly open marketplace of ideas, many awful propositions will be put forward. Recently, for instance, we saw claims that Hurricane Milton was created by Jews, or that it was geo-engineered to target red states. But Lehmann is correct that we shouldn’t micromanage art in order to engineer the souls of citizens. Any history book on communism provides a ready education on where that winding path inevitably leads. So where does this leave us? One problem is that our institutions are crumbling. As I have argued elsewhere, our universities and news outlets, two of the most important sources of education, have been subverted by Marxist ideology. To Hanania’s point, what can we do about the fact that given enough rope, Americans may well hang themselves? The answer is staring us in the face. As philosopher John Dewey put it, 'The only solution to the ills of democracy … is more democracy.' But you may be wondering, what sense does that make if you’re saying the system we have isn’t working? How will doubling down solve anything? It won’t. There will always be a rattling noise built into the machinery—some of it born of ignorance, some of folly, and some of outright malice. Ours is not a perfect union, nor will it ever be. The misguided notion that we can engineer perfection is not only wrong but evil, for in order to rebuild the human soul, first, you must break it. But this does not mean we cannot strive for perfection. Such was the message our Founding Fathers left us in the preamble to the Constitution when they wrote of creating 'a more perfect union.' Better than before, yet never flawless. We must set legal boundaries, and within those boundaries, allow the kids to play. There will be bruises. There will be bullies. But we want our kids to learn resilience by handling their own problems—because if you coddle them, you will protect them from harm here and now, but create a brittle constitution that’s ultimately more susceptible to damage. To paraphrase Winston Churchill’s famous line on democracy, the marketplace of ideas may be the worst arena for discerning truth, except for all the others.

German ‘Democracy’: The Regime Bans Political Parties It Doesn’t ...	In democracies, parties are supposed to rise and fall at the ballot box. However, in Germany a provision of the postwar constitution allows for political parties to be banned if they are deemed a 'threat to democracy.' This unique constitutional mechanism has been used only twice, first against the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and later against the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. Today, this legal tool is once again at the center of political debate, with growing calls to ban the 'right-wing' Alternative for Germany (AfD). This effort raises profound questions about the nature of democracy, in Germany and everywhere else. Can a party that wins millions of votes in free elections truly be a threat to democracy? Or is the German establishment using constitutional provisions to stifle political opposition under the guise of protecting democratic order? Germany’s History of Party Bans Germany’s constitution, called the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), adopted in 1949, includes Article 21, which allows the Federal Constitutional Court to ban parties that are deemed to 'seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order.' The first case of Article 21’s use came in 1952 with the banning of the Socialist Reich Party (SRP), a successor to the Nazi Party. The SRP openly opposed the legitimacy of the Federal Republic and so the court ruled that the party posed a direct threat to the constitutional order and ordered its dissolution. A few years later, in 1956, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) faced the same fate. Although it did not advocate violent overthrow, it was seen as fundamentally opposed to the principles of liberal democracy and too closely aligned with Soviet communism. The court again ruled in favor of a ban, cementing the idea that political extremism of any kind had no place in postwar Germany. Since then, there have been only two serious attempts to ban parties, both against the National Democratic Party (NPD), in 2003 and 2017. The first attempt failed due to procedural errors, and the second was dismissed on the grounds that the party was too small and insignificant to pose a real threat. The AfD and the New Debate on Party Bans Now, in 2024 calls to use this extraordinary legal measure against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) have gained momentum. The AfD, founded in 2013 as a Euroskeptic party, has since shifted to a more nationalist and populist platform. It has gained substantial electoral support, particularly in eastern Germany, and regularly polls above 20% nationwide. Its rise has deeply unsettled Germany’s political establishment, which views it as a threat not only to domestic politics but also to the European Union. The push to ban the AfD has been some time in coming. In 2021, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), classified the AfD as a 'potential extremist threat' and placed it under surveillance. A recent ruling by a German high court in May 2024 upheld this classification, granting security services the continued right to monitor the party’s activities. In January 2024, the Bundestag debated the possibility of formally requesting that the Constitutional Court rule on an AfD ban. This motion, initiated by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz and backed by 124 MPs from various parties, sought to examine whether the AfD’s platform and rhetoric violate the Basic Law. The timing was striking, coming just a day after the CDU, under Friedrich Merz, had controversially cooperated with the AfD on an immigration vote. This moment revealed deep fractures within Germany’s political right, as well as the establishment’s increasing willingness to consider extreme measures against its nationalist challenger. The AfD is not a fringe group; it has won millions of votes in free and fair elections. In a functioning democracy, unpopular or even radical parties are meant to be countered at the ballot box, not through judicial fiat. Proponents of a ban argue that the AfD’s rhetoric and policies, particularly its hardline stance on immigration, opposition to EU integration, and alleged ties to extremist groups, make it an existential threat to Germany’s democratic order. Critics, however, point out that similar nationalist parties exist elsewhere in Europe, such as Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France or Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy (currently in power in Rome), yet they operate within the democratic framework without being outlawed. Furthermore, banning the AfD would not eliminate the sentiments that fueled its rise. If anything, it could further radicalize its supporters, reinforcing a narrative of elite suppression and deepening divisions within German society. The EU and the Bigger Picture The movement to ban the AfD cannot be separated from the broader European context. The party has positioned itself as a fierce critic of the European Union, advocating for Germany to reclaim national sovereignty and even leave the euro. This places it in direct opposition to the pro-EU consensus that dominates German elites in politics. From Brussels’ perspective, the AfD’s rise represents a serious challenge. Germany is the economic and political backbone of the EU, and a nationalist turn in Berlin could threaten the bloc’s cohesion. The EU has already clashed with nationalist governments in Hungary and Poland; a strong AfD presence in Germany would take these tensions to a new level. For this reason, many in the German establishment, as well as in European institutions, likely see banning the AfD as a preemptive strike against a growing anti-EU movement. Yet, resorting to legal mechanisms to suppress dissent only raises more concerns about the health of democracy in Europe. We will all be watching the elections in Germany later this month with great interest to see whether the AfD continues its rise.

Egg Prices And The Cause Of Harris’ Defeat – OpEd	Since everyone else has given their two cents on the cause of Harris’ defeat, I guess I will weigh in with my two cents. This comes with the warning; I am an economist, so everything looks like a nail to me. First, there is one point that should be front and center in every discussion of the election results. Harris won overwhelmingly among more informed voters who follow the news closely. She got clobbered among less informed voters, people who, by their self-description, say they follow the news little or not at all. This is important because it is not plausible that a big factor in Harris defeat could have been positions she took long ago, like when she was running for president in 2019. Whether those positions helped her or hurt her, the fact is that Harris almost certainly won by a large margin by people who were aware of her 2019 presidential campaign. Rather, insofar as issues mattered in a very close election (Trump’s popular vote margin was less than Hilary Clinton’s in 2016), it had to be issues that the least informed voters could be aware of. This is where the price of eggs, or more generally the cost of living comes in. The cost of living did rise rapidly under the Biden-Harris administration. We know this was almost entirely due to the pandemic, since almost every other country had similar inflation. It isn’t plausible to argue that France, Germany, and Australia all had high inflation because of Biden’s recovery package. But that is not what the public saw or heard. The public heard Donald Trump endlessly harping on high grocery prices and that he would bring them down. The media (I mean the NYT and CNN, not Fox and OANN) largely went along with this line, rarely pointing out that it was pandemic inflation, as opposed to Biden inflation. We were told the public blames Biden for inflation not the pandemic. This really meant that it was the media that blamed Biden.They didn’t report on inflation from the pandemic as being 'pandemic inflation' in the same way they felt the need to always refer to the withdrawal from Afghanistan as the 'disastrous withdrawal' from Afghanistan. In effect, since Trump and the Republicans’ charges went largely unanswered, and even reinforced by the media, the vast majority of the public believed them. Biden certainly deserves much blame on this account since his physical and mental state left him unprepared to make the aggressive defense of his policies that was needed. I will also add a point that should be obvious but has confused many of our elite pundits. It’s true that the people who voted for Trump in large numbers do not follow the major media outlets, but this does not mean their views were not affected by what the NYT, NPR, and the rest report. Contrary to what these pundits seem to believe, people do not live in hermetically sealed worlds. Even if people get their news from TikTok influencers or what their friend rants about over a beer, it’s likely that their sources views were in some ways affected by what appears in the major media outlets. If these outlets were regularly reporting on 'pandemic inflation' and highlighting the many successes of the Biden administration (half-century lows in unemployment, record rates of new business formation, fastest real wage growth at the bottom since the 60s), some of this would have percolated through to the least informed voters. Instead, they were invariably hyping the negative. For example, last summer the New York Times told readers about a 'two-tiered' economy highlighting a low-wage worker whose pay had not kept pace with prices, even as the piece itself acknowledged this person was atypical. The pay of most low-wage workers had substantially outpaced prices. The NYT also told readers that recent college grads couldn’t find jobs. This was at a time when the unemployment rate for recent grads was near a 20-year low. And the NYT, CNN, and the rest repeatedly highlighted the claim that young people were giving up on ever being able to own a home. They were doing this even when homeownership rates among the young were above their pre-pandemic peak. My argument is that this bad news about the economy became part of the message that millions of least informed voters had in their heads when they cast their votes in November. To be clear, I don’t mean this was the only factor. Many of these people heard Trump’s rants about DEI, and they noticed that the Democratic candidate was a Black woman. That surely mattered. I’m sure the devastation in Gaza also bothered many voters and likely discouraged many young people from voting. But if we’re looking for a single factor that had a large impact of many low-informed voters, I would argue that inflation topped the list. Again, I would point to Trump’s fixation on grocery prices. I am not one to defer to Trump’s genius, but he does have a successful political track record. If he felt it was important to talk about grocery prices, it is reasonable to believe that he had good polling data indicating that this would resonate with voters. I’ll also add as an aside my Twitter experience. I would frequently post notes on Elon’s site about good economic news, such as low unemployment, rising real wages, or slowing inflation. These posts would invariably provoke a rash of responses about how everyone had to work three jobs and still couldn’t pay for their rent or groceries. After the election, the starving masses disappeared from Twitter. To be clear, I know tens of millions of people are really struggling, so I am not mocking them at all. The point is just that they were not on Twitter in 2019, and they are not there now. Obviously, someone working with Musk felt it was politically useful to have a bot army constantly trash the economy on his site. Of course, Trump and Musk can be wrong about what matters to voters, but I would take their insights seriously. They both felt that inflation was a very big deal. I think they were right. Lessons for the Battle to Save Democracy Trump is engaged in an unprecedented attack on our democracy, ignoring all sorts of laws and the Constitution itself. I would never tell people not to confront this head on in every way we can. This is absolutely necessary, but I would also talk about the price of eggs. Trump promised people that he would lower the price of groceries beginning on day one. While we know he has been busy making plans to take over Canada, Greenland, and Gaza, and sending Elon into our personal banking and medical records, we haven’t heard much about his plans to lower prices. Of course, Trump has no such plans. The claim that he would bring down prices was always a lie. And not only is he not bringing down prices, the cost of some items, such as coffee and eggs, is going through the roof. This seems a great point to drive home. There may be many people who don’t know about the Constitutional issues or take seriously Trump’s plans for his resort in Gaza, but they do see skyrocketing egg prices at the supermarket and the egg surcharge they pay at Waffle House. And, for what it’s worth, Elon Musk seems to agree with my political assessment. My posts on Twitter in the last couple of months had been getting very little engagement, however my posts on egg prices have led to a flock of outraged responses. Obviously, the site has some sort of algorithm designed to trigger responses to this sort of complaint about Trump. I will add that I know the criticism is not entirely fair. The jump in egg prices was due to an outbreak of Avian flu that occurred before Trump took office, although how he deals with the outbreak going forward is on him. But this is very similar to the story of the pandemic and Biden. The media kept telling us that people don’t blame the pandemic for inflation, they blame Biden. If Biden can be nailed for inflation caused by the pandemic, we should be able to nail Trump for soaring egg prices caused by Avian flu. After all, people don’t see Avian flu, they see high egg prices. Again, we have to hit Trump head on for his law-breaking and its consequences. But for my money, I’m listening to what Elon Musk is telling us. I’m going to talk about egg prices.

President Trump Provides Reason for Hope The Ukraine War May End ...	The change in tone is night and day from the Joe Biden administration to the Donald Trump administration. Biden refused to talk with Russia President Vladimir. At the same time, Biden escalated US efforts against Russia, including in the Ukraine War. Trump, in contrast, ran for president proclaiming his desire to end the Ukraine War promptly and Wednesday morning posted at Truth Social a recounting of a conversation he had just completed with Putin. That post by Trump is bursting with optimism about negotiating to soon end the war, as well as with kind comments regarding Putin and Russia. Here is Trump’s statement in his Truth Social post: 'I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects. We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering, that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many! We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together. But first, as we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, 'COMMON SENSE.' We both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now. I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful. Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost! I want to thank President Putin for his time and effort with respect to this call, and for the release, yesterday, of Marc Fogel, a wonderful man that I personally greeted last night at the White House. I believe this effort will lead to a successful conclusion, hopefully soon!' Wow. What a refreshing message. Let’s hope this war is ended quickly and peace between Russia and the US ensues. Putin seems amenable to this, having declared on day one of Trump’s presidency his desire to enter into dialog with Trump with objectives including ending the war and bringing about a peaceful relationship between Russia and the US. Trump is on a deadline. If this war keeps dragging on with US support, it will increasingly become understood as Trump’s war as well as Biden’s war. Even if he is then able to help bring the war to an end, Trump will be remembered in this instance as a warmaker instead of the peacemaker he presented himself as in his campaign.

Germany: Ukraine War, Impact Of Rearmament, Economic Woes Loom Ov...	By Michael von der Schulenburg The war in Ukraine and its consequences will have a long-lasting negative impact on the political, security, economic and social future of Germany. It is the biggest war on European soil since the Second World War; a war which has brought us dangerously close to a nuclear catastrophe in recent months. For the West, this war has now been lost; Ukraine is its blood sacrifice and EU countries, above all Germany, are the losers. The main German parties of SPD, CDU/CSU, the Greens and FDP, as well as the established German media, bear a heavy blame for this. However, questions about their responsibilities in this war have been mysteriously muted during the ongoing German election campaign. Similarly, the German government’s huge rearmament efforts and its attempts to make Germany ‘fit for war’ are barely discussed. There is no word about the dangers of deploying powerful US missile systems on German soil. The election posters of the established parties say nothing about any of it. The mainstream media are silent about the disastrous military and political situation in Ukraine and remain equally mute about the fundamental shift in US policy on Ukraine since Donald Trump became US President. It is as if there is a deliberate effort to keep German voters in the dark about these highly controversial issues; issues that could greatly impact their and their children’s future ability to live in peace. Sliding into a German decline All of this happens at a time when the war in Ukraine has reached its final and decisive —and probably also its bloodiest—phase. Militarily, the Ukrainian army is likely on the verge of collapse, and it is to be feared that this could result in a political collapse of the country too. For three years, Germany has fueled this war as the second largest supplier of weapons. And still, the main German parties continue their rigid war policies and pretend to believe in a victory over Russia. Apart from an inconclusive telephone conversation by the German Chancellor with Putin, they have made no efforts to find a negotiated solution. Germany will now have to pay a high price for its pro-war, no-negotiation strategies . Now, neither the EU nor Germany, but an American and a Russian president will negotiate a peace settlement to end the war in Ukraine. The negotiations have already begun, and Trump and Putin are expected to meet in person in just a few weeks. This has become possible because of a significant shift change in US foreign policy priorities under President Trump. Unlike his predecessor Biden, Trump no longer sees Ukraine a geopolitical asset for the USA—his attention appears to have moved closer to home: to Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal. He will therefore seek a quick solution to the Ukraine war and be prepared to accommodate most Russian interests, while largely ignoring Ukraine’s. We must have no illusions—neither of these two presidents will have any sympathy for Zelensky, the EU, and especially not for Germany. Why should they? Zelensky is considered a spent force, while German and EU policy continues to be characterized by a refusal to face the reality of a lost war. And haven’t German political elites treated Putin and Trump with a moral arrogance that is so typical for them? So, neither Germany nor the EU will have a say in these negotiations. This is bad for the EU and bad for Germany—this war is taking place on European soil, and the decisions taken by Trump and Putin will have serious consequences for the future of both Germany and Europe. One such consequence will be that the EU, and above all Germany, will have to pay for the enormous costs of rebuilding Ukraine and keeping a faltering Ukrainian government afloat. If Ursula von der Leyen were to succeed in her ill-advised desire of fast-tracking Ukraine’s membership into the EU, the total price tag could easily add up to a trillion euros. Whether such astronomical sums would help a collapsing and depopulating Ukraine remains questionable. But it would wreck Germany’s already weakened economy and could put the entire EU project into jeopardy. In addition, Germany would continue to be blocked from access to the raw materials and markets in the East and Asia that would be so important for the recovery of its economy. After a US-Russian peace agreement, Russia will control the entire border from the Barents Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. And the government would not even be in a position to cancel the EU’s self-crippling economic sanctions. Germany’s road to further economic decline with all its political consequences appears unstoppable. Escaping into ‘fit for war’ fantasies With defeat in the war in Ukraine looming, the SPD, CDU/CSU, Greens, and FDP, supported by much of the German media, seem to prefer to hide from tough realities and to escape into the fantasy that Putin is going to attack NATO. If Germany does not massively and quickly upgrade its defences, they say, he will soon be marching through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Such claims, bordering on madness, are used to distract from a lost war and to justify spending hundreds of billions of euros on a German rearmament that could make Germany, once again, the largest military power in Europe—in conventional forces even larger than Russia. All this will inevitably be financed largely through a reduction in social services. To justify all of this, the German political parties cling to their Russophobia and ideological-moralistic ‘narratives’ of needing to defend democracy and freedom. But those justifications now begin to wear thin. While German politicians and their supporters in the media continue mantra-like to blame Putin for an 'unprovoked war of aggression', Trump is blaming his predecessor Biden for the war and accusing Zelensky of having provoked the Russian attack. And while the German narrative remains that Putin is driven by imperialistic desires, Trump is saying what we have always known: it was the push for NATO expansion into Ukraine, driven by the US neocons and continued by Biden, that led to this war. Trump has gone even further and declared that he can ‘even understand Putin’. In Germany, one would probably lose one’s job for saying that! The new US government does not share our fantasies about an impending Russian war against NATO. As early as last year, the seven US intelligence services stated in a joint report that a Russian attack on a NATO country could be ruled out with a high probability. What now? German mainstream politicians, most being transatlantic loyalists to the core, have lost their lord and master, a troubling development so shortly before the federal election. That is why the lost war in Ukraine, along with massive Germn rearmament efforts, are kept out of the national election campaign. With all the money those established parties have, this will help to secure the reelection of a Merz and Kiesewetter, a Scholz and Pistorius, a Habeck and a Baerbock or even a Lindner and a Strack-Zimmerman; all politicians who maintain an uncompromising pro-war posture towards Russia and who are taking an increasingly aggressive attitude towards China. According to the opinion polls, this is what is going to happen. Germany is therefore likely to be governed once more by politicians who supported a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people and made Germany one of its main losers. In other words, Germany will continue to have a government unable to adjust to a changing world around it. It will now also be increasingly at odds with the new US government. It will be unable to mend fences with Russia and China or build relations with the increasingly important association of BRICS countries. Hence, Germany is likely to slide further into global isolation—a terrible prospect for a nation that depends on international trade for its economic well-being. At the same time, the mainstream media’s uncritical support for the established parties drives disappointed voters into the arms of the right-wing AfD. This could divide German society even further and make Germany’s future even more unpredictable. Apart from concerns about its radical nationalist wing, the AfD wants to outdo the other parties by demanding Germany to commit a staggering 5% of GDP to rearmament; something which could only be financed by a neoliberal economic policy, further gigantic debts, and massive social cuts. And their flirtation with American oligarchs will certainly do no good either. The price for the ideological-moralistic and pro-war policies of German politicians from Merz to Weidel and from Scholz to Habeck, will be paid above all by pensioners and low-income earners, workers and employees, families and children, as well as small and medium-sized industries. The big companies and the rich are simply moving their businesses abroad; the USA has already created the necessary incentives for them. German policies need to break with the past If we want to save what can still be saved, Germany needs a definitive turnaround in all of areas of its policy. It must find a way back to a peace policy and finally formulate its own interests and act accordingly. To do this, we must get along with our eastern neighbors again; we must build a trusting relationship with Russia and China and engage in trade with them. For the EU member states, the BRICS countries are increasingly important partners not only structurally and economically, but also politically. The opportunity is there to create a new geopolitical constellation through which these two communities of states could work towards a more peaceful, multipolar world order based on the UN Charter and without military alliances. At the same time, we must maintain internal peace by making social justice the most important goal of our policies. Rearmament and the arms trade, military interventions, or the deployment of US medium-range missiles on German soil will not help at all. We need a radical new beginning urgently. To do that, we need politicians who have always stood up for peace and social justice. The federal elections would be an opportunity to make a start on this. We should think very carefully about who we vote for on 23 February.

Russia-Bound Chemicals Seized By Spain Critical For Kremlin’s Mil...	By Mark Krutov and Sergei Dobrynin (RFE/RL) -- In the fall of 2024, Spanish authorities announced they had uncovered a supply chain to Russia for sanctioned chemicals, including compounds that could be used to make chemical weapons and nerve-agent poisons. EU exports of such chemicals to Russia would be certain to raise alarm bells given the links of Russian security services to nerve-agent attacks on Kremlin enemies, including the late opposition leader Aleksei Navalny. Spanish authorities did not release details about the specific chemicals in the 13,000 tons they seized, or the types of chemical weapons they could help produce. But an RFE/RL investigation found that the haul included a compound that plays a key role in Russia’s war machine.RFE/RL’s Russian Service analyzed a video of the bust released by Spanish police and found that the listed contents of barrels they seized has wide application in Russia’s military industry, including the production of drones, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and batteries for nuclear submarines. The compound in question is a strong chemical solvent called N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, whose abbreviation, NMP, is visible on the labels on some barrels shown in the Spanish police video. Widely used in the petroleum and pharmaceutical industries, NMP was included in the EU list of goods prohibited for sale to Russia in April 2022, six weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine.Global consumption of NMP has also grown due to its use in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries and microcircuits.The labels on the barrels shown in the Spanish police video also indicate the seized NMP was produced by a Chinese chemicals company, and the container number indicates the shipment arrived in Barcelona three months after departing the Chinese port of Qingdao in June, an analysis of shipping records by RFE/RL’s Russian Service found.Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Chinese-produced NMP has been purchased by a subsidiary of sanctioned Russian state-owned conglomerate Rostec that is a supplier to a unit of Russia’s Kurchatov Institute, a sanctioned nuclear-weapons developer, involved in drone production.It is unclear whether the cargo shown in the video is the only shipment that Spanish police and customs officers detained during their two-year investigation into illicit trafficking of dual-use goods. Spanish authorities have not released the names of the individuals or companies suspected in the case, and Spanish police did not respond to RFE/RL’s inquiry about what substance or substances were seized in the October raid in the port of Barcelona. A ‘Critical’ Chemical Russia does not produce its own NMP, leaving it reliant on imports of a compound included in the country’s list of critical products for its chemicals sector.Prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, there were cases of Russia’s military-industrial complex purchasing Western-produced NMP. For example, Russian procurement records show that the sanctioned Russian company Uralelementin 2018 purchased 1.5 tons of German-made NMP from another Russian firm, Uraltekhimport. Uralelement, which describes itself as 'a strategic enterprise of the military-industrial complex,' is part of the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Tactical Missiles Corporation, which was also hit with Western sanctions in 2022.In July 2021, Deputy Defense Minister Aleksei Krivoruchko visited the Uralelement plant. A message on the company’s website states that Krivoruchko 'signed important decisions related to the production of special-purpose batteries by Uralelement for Military Unit 40056.' Open-source records show that military unit 40056 is part of what is now the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research (GUGI). It was under the auspices of the GUGI that a secretive surveillance submarine known informally as the Losharik suffered a catastrophic accident in 2019 while conducting tests in the Barents Sea. A short circuit in the battery compartment was later blamed for the accident.Another buyer of NMP before Russia’s all-out war against Ukraine was the Arzamas Research and Production Enterprise Temp-Avia, also part of the Tactical Missiles Corporation, which produces electronics for Russian military aircraft and drone missile systems, government procurement data shows.In the spring of 2023, Temp Avia’s director said that 'the workload of production in connection with' Russia’s war on Ukraine 'has increased multiple times.'Still another buyer of NMP was the Central Design and Technology Bureau of Polymer Materials with Pilot Production, which supplied materials to the Votkinsk Plant, a manufacturer of Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles.Around half of the 29 publicly available government purchases of NMP prior to 2022 that RFE/RL’s Russian Service reviewed are from state-owned companies linked to the military-industrial complex.Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chinese-made NMP has also been purchased by the Petrov Institute of Plastics, a Rostec subsidiary. Corporate records show that one of the institute’s key customers is VIAM, the aviation-materials unit of the Kurchatov Institute, a nuclear-weapons developer headed by close Putin associate Mikhail Kovalchuk. At a roundtable last year, a senior VIAM scientist discussed the 'development of state unmanned aircraft for special purposes, taking into account air defense systems' and spoke 'about the experience in the development of materials and additive technologies for the production of structures of unmanned aircraft systems.' Tracking The Shipment Analyzing the labels on the barrels shown in the Spanish police video, RFE/RL’s Russian Service identified the manufacturer of the seized NMP as the Chinese company BYN Electronic Material, whose product range includes the solvent. The video also shows the container’s number, YMLU3377990, which indicates it is owned by the Chinese shipping company YangMing Marine Transport Corp. The company’s website reveals the route of the seized shipment: It left the Chinese port of Qingdao on June 19 and arrived in Singapore on July 10. On July 28, it left for Barcelona, where it arrived on September 21 -- three weeks before Spanish police announced the seizure. Records reviewed by RFE/RL’s Russian Service show that NMP produced by BYN was purchased in 2023 by the Russian company Aventel RUS. Prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Aventel RUS sought to become a supplier of NMP to the Sverdlov Plant, a Russian explosives manufacturer under U.S. sanctions, but was unsuccessful in its bid. ‘Operation Test Tube’ The Spanish investigation, conducted with assistance from the European Anti-Fraud Office, began in 2022 under the code name Operation Probirka, the Russian word for 'test tube.' Spanish police say they zeroed in on a Spanish company 'managed by citizens of Russian origin' who developed a complex network to supply 'illegal chemical products to Russia.' The Spanish firm had a subsidiary in Moscow that was the ultimate recipient of the chemicals, though their final destination was obscured by shell companies in third countries, including Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, that served as intermediaries, Spanish police allege.They said shipments were diverted to Russia en route by land to these fictitious recipients, a scheme that has been used to funnel sanctioned dual-use electronics to Russia through Central Asia in circumvention of U.S. and EU efforts to choke off global supply chains for Russia’s military. Spanish police, who said in their October announcement of the raid that their case was ongoing, did not respond to a request for comment about the current status of the investigation.

Pashinyan Promotes New Ideology To Guide Armenia’s Geopolitical T...	(Eurasianet) -- Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is pushing for an ideological transformation to establish what he calls 'real Armenia.' To succeed, he will have to win a three-front fight to overcome opposition from Azerbaijan, Russia and a powerful bloc of domestic critics. Having returned from a foreign tour that took him to Washington and Paris, Pashinyan answered questions in parliament on February 12 about his 'Real Armenia' vision. The tenets of the ideology are still being fleshed out, he explained. But the broad outline is the promotion of a Westernized, democratized nation that has drawn a line on the past and is firmly fixed on forging a prosperous future. The prime minister stated that a written platform for the Real Armenia concept would be finalized and published soon. Once published, he added, the government would launch an effort to sell the vision to the electorate. 'From that point,' Pashinyan stated, referring to publication of the platform, 'we must begin the formation and formulation of a consensus around the concept of 'real Armenia.'' Pashinyan told MPs that he has received assurances of support from US and French officials for what he is trying to accomplish, describing an impromptu meeting with US Vice President JD Vance in Washington in early February as 'very important and very productive.' Parliament took immediate action on the real Armenia vision February 12, approving in its first reading a bill authorizing the government to seek European Union membership, a process that could take decades to accomplish. The prime minister’s efforts to achieve an identity makeover for Armenia is rooted in the country’s decisive defeat to Azerbaijan in the Second Karabakh War in late 2023. The military disaster prompted the collapse of the country’s traditional strategic partnership with Russia, which many Armenians believe failed to fulfill security commitments to defend Armenian sovereignty. Since then, Pashinyan has sought to strengthen ties to US and European political, economic and security institutions, while striving to conclude a peace deal with Azerbaijan. Peace, Pashinyan holds, is a prerequisite for the formation of a prosperous domestic economy. The real Armenia concept seeks to tie all its policy goals together. Pashinyan may have the backing of the United States and France, as well as many MPs, but how far he gets in pursuit of the real Armenia project is uncertain given the scope of opposition he faces from three directions. Russia, Armenia’s main trade partner at present, is firmly opposed to the country’s efforts to move into the Western geopolitical camp, especially its pursuit of EU accession. 'We consider the West's line in the South Caucasus to be absolutely destructive, because it is not aimed at stabilizing the situation in this strategically important region for Russia, but at trying to ‘contribute’ to inflicting a strategic defeat on us from this flank,' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview published February 10 by the Russian outlet Izvestia. Armenia remains a member of the Russia-dominated trade group, the Eurasian Economic Union, giving the Kremlin economic leverage over Yerevan. Following the Armenian parliament’s EU accession vote, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded by noting that Russian officials 'proceed from the fact that Armenia continues to receive dividends from membership in the EAEU in the processes of Eurasian economic integration, and these dividends are more than obvious.' Elsewhere, the Armenian-Azerbaijani peace process that had until recently seemed tantalizingly close to reaching the finish line, now is moving in the wrong direction. Both sides have traded accusations of late that the other intends to restart armed conflict. And on February 13, Baku filed a new lawsuit in the International Court of Arbitration in the Hague, seeking to hold Armenia responsible for causing environmental damage in Karabakh. The issue of handling international court cases involving Armenia and Azerbaijan has been one of the points holding up finalization of a peace treaty. Perhaps the most determined opposition to the real Armenia vision is coming from critics within Armenia and among Diaspora groups. A major source of discontent within these constituencies is Pashinyan’s willingness to recognize Azerbaijan’s lasting sovereignty over Karabakh. 'Pashinyan is trying to deprive Armenians of the right to even dream of restoring 'historic Armenia' someday in the future,' stated a commentary published in late January by the Armenian Weekly, which is operated by Armenian Revolutionary Federation. 'He naively thinks that by announcing that Armenia does not have any territorial demands against its neighboring countries, he will convince Azerbaijan to sign a meaningless peace treaty with Armenia.' Pashinyan seems clear-eyed about the daunting obstacles standing in his way. In parliament, he said it will be up to Armenian voters to decide whether the 'real Armenia' blueprint is fully implemented. 'This ideology must be tested in the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2026,' Pashinyan told MPs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PDfWpNJh9WLg	2025-02-13T16:26:23-08:00	
Europe Insists It Must Be Included In Ukraine Peace Talks	By Alexandra Brzozowski and Aurélie Pugnet (EurActiv) -- European defence ministers made clear on Thursday they did not want to be sidelined in Ukraine peace talks as the US is still yet to signal willingness to bring Europe to the table. Since Wednesday evening, Europeans have implored the future of Ukraine should not be decided without Europe or Kyiv, after Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agreed to 'immediately' hold peace talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy then spoke with Trump shortly after. The move gave the Europeans a glimpse of what the negotiations could look like: a US-Russia deal with no Europeans at the table – despite the fact the war is on their continent, they have contributed vast amounts of military aid to Ukraine, and slapped Moscow with package after package of sanctions. This came just after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth detailed the US lines for the negotiations: any return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is 'unrealistic', Ukraine’s NATO membership is unlikely, and no US troops on the ground. In the weeks prior, European diplomats had voiced concern about a scenario where Trump would be inclined to hold bilateral talks with Putin over Ukrainian and European heads. Between worry, denial and acceptance The first reactions came from a group of European foreign ministers from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, the EU and the UK on Wednesday evening, saying any future peace deal could not be achieved without the involvement of Ukraine and its European partners. They said that they were 'looking forward to discussing the way ahead together with our American allies.' 'There will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans,' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told ministers. Germany's Annalena Baerbock and Spain's José Manuel Albares both said that 'no decision on Ukraine can be made without Ukraine' and called for EU unity. 'We believe that America’s strength, together with Ukraine and all our partners, is enough to push Russia to peace,' Zelenskyy also said on X, in a nod to Europe. Europe justifies its inclusion European minds did not settle overnight. Several NATO defence ministers offered further justification for Europe’s inclusion on Thursday morning, just a few minutes before a meeting in Brussels with Hegseth. Europe will be the ones providing security guarantees to the Ukraine, hence there is 'no option to not be at the table' Ruben Brekelmans, Dutch defence minister said. Asked who should represent the Europeans at such talks, he did not provide details. Others suggested Europe should be included on the grounds that their support for Ukraine has been substantial and impactful. 'Europe has to be part of these negotiations... Europe has put sanctions on Russia, Europe is investing in Ukrainian defence and Europe is rebuilding Ukraine with European Union money, with our bilateral aid, etcetera,' Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said. 'For us, it's very natural also that we as European allies are engaged into these discussions. Last year, we provided about 60% to the military support,' Pål Jonson, Sweden’s defence minister said. For the Lithuanians, being included is about military strength. 'It's up to us whether we will be sidelined or whether we will stand up to the expectations and to our actual capacity to fight for Ukraine, to fight for our own freedom,' Dovilė Šakalienė said. Some, such as Canada’s Bill Blair or Luxembourg’s Yuriko Backes, preferred to emphasise only Ukraine’s role at the table, and did not comment on Europe. The British Defence Secretary John Healey said in a brief statement that 'there can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine, and Ukraine's voice must be at the heart of any talks.' Brussels, meanwhile, was quick to assert itself on Wednesday evening. 'Any agreement that excludes Europe won’t work. Europe will not be sidelined,' an EU official told Euractiv. Next stop: Munich The tactics behind Hegseth’s public clarification of the US’s red lines on Ukraine, immediately before Trump announced the opening of negotiations, were called into question by some. 'The positions expressed by the US Secretary of Defense were well expected, but in negotiations with Russia, it's unwise to play your cards too soon,' the EU official said. Nonetheless, the comments set the tone for a flurry of further meetings, with NATO defence ministers meeting for a second day in Brussels on Thursday and the Munich Security Conference starting on Friday. European diplomats told Euractiv they would use the Munich talks to seek out American counterparts in various constellations and try to hammer in their points when it comes to Ukraine. Trump implied that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would meet Zelenskyy in Munich on Friday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PCQ09XT7DuMv	2025-02-13T16:15:47-08:00	
Trump Hosts India’s Leader, Pushes US Defense, Energy Sales	By Anita Powell U.S. President Donald Trump hosts Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Thursday, where administration officials say he will seek to boost U.S. defense and energy sales and further strengthen Washington’s relationship with the world’s most-populous nation as China flexes its muscles in the region. 'We will aim to build on defense sales to India to ensure they are prioritizing the use of American technology,' said an administration official in a briefing with reporters Thursday morning. As is custom when briefing journalists, the official is not being named. 'The president is also focused on unleashing American energy to the rest of the world and will prioritize India as a key importer of America's natural resources to power their economy,' the official said. 'The two leaders will discuss how we can improve our trade relationship that brings down our bilateral trade deficit and ensure an expanded fair-trade relationship.' When asked directly about New Delhi’s largest concern — of being caught in the wave of reciprocal tariffs Trump has recently imposed as part of an escalating trade war with the world — a second administration official said, 'What you'll see coming out of a meeting today is further momentum towards a solidified, fair — and I emphasize that word ‘fair’ — bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies. And the hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025.' That official also touted announcements on 'semiconductors, critical minerals, supply chain resilience and diversification.' Modi said on X that he was 'looking forward to meeting @POTUS Donald Trump and building upon the India-USA Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Our nations will keep working closely for the benefit of our people and for a better future for our planet.' Analysts say China also looms large in these talks, and the White House added that the two leaders would discuss the elevation of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Australia and Japan. 'The sharp deterioration in India-China relations after the 2020 Galwan Valley incident,' in which Indian and Chinese troops clashed over road construction in disputed territory, 'undoubtedly encouraged New Delhi to be more enthusiastic about its strategic partnership with Washington,' said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser at the U.S. Institute of Peace. And India-focused analyst Rick Rossow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told VOA about India’s goals. 'As President Trump kind of initiates a trade war against the world, India's got bigger stakes than a lot of countries do in that, and they need to make sure that the relations remain stable,' Rossow said. 'So, they want to be here. They want to be in front. They want to talk about things they can buy from the United States. They want to talk about policies they can resolve and try to make sure that things remain on an even keel, because this relationship, it's important for us. It's vital for India.' VOA’s Paris Huang contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PCEdbDNTlv_q	2025-02-13T16:09:09-08:00	
No Deals Without Us, Zelenskyy Says In Response To Trump-Putin Ca...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reacted sharply to U.S. President Donald Trump's agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin negotiations to end the war with Ukraine, saying he won't accept any deals made without Ukraine's involvement. Trump's call on February 12 is seen as part of the White House's aim to move quickly toward ending the almost 3-year-old war, and 'certainly not a betrayal' of Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on February 13. But news of the 90-minute phone call between the two leaders sent shockwaves across Europe, where leaders bitterly complained of seemingly being cut out of the process. Zelenskyy said Ukraine cannot 'allow everything to go according to Putin’s plan' and cannot accept any agreements made without it. Speaking during a visit to a nuclear power station in western Ukraine, he said he wanted to 'articulate this very clearly to our partners.' Trump said later on February 13 at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia. Trump said again that he believes Putin 'wants peace' and would 'like to see something happen,' but Zelenskyy warned against putting any trust Putin's claims of readiness to end the war. The Ukrainian leader said he wanted the United States to agree a 'plan to stop Putin' before any negotiations. Trump also repeated his criticism that former President Joe Biden had invited the conflict by assuring Ukraine it would eventually join NATO. Trump told reporters that Putin was encouraged to invade Ukraine because he sensed U.S. and NATO weakness after the chaotic withdrawal of allied troops from Afghanistan in 2021. Trump also said Russia’s expulsion from the Group of Eight leading industrialized countries after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014 was another key factor in forcing Putin’s hand. Russia's full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, is seen by the majority of nations in the world as an unprovoked and illegal act of aggression designed to grab land and and do away with the Ukrainian state and its democracy. 'I Think They Have To Make Peace' Trump announced his call on February 12 in a post on Truth Social that said he and Putin 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.' He spoke further about his plans later at the White House, telling reporters: 'I think we’re on the way to getting peace.' In a blow to Ukraine's stated goals to join NATO and push Russia out of all parts of Ukraine it occupies, Hegseth told NATO allies in Brussels on February 12 that it is 'unrealistic' to expect Ukraine's borders to revert to 2014 and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict. Trump also said giving Ukraine NATO membership would not be 'practical.' The comments are some of the clearest indications from the new Trump administration of how the president intends to fulfill his election campaign promise to swiftly end the war, but some observers said it was a poor strategy to lay the groundwork for negotiations by granting terms favorable to Russia. Oxana Shevel, a professor of political science at Tufts University, told RFE/RL that Ukraine had already reckoned that its hopes of joining NATO would be off the table in a negotiation process to end the war. But she warned that it would be a bigger deal if Putin tried to convince Trump to rollback NATO’s declaration on Ukraine's 'irreversible path' to membership. 'Putin would love to have that,' Shevel said, adding that she could not imagine that would go down well with the European NATO countries. Shevel also said it’s a 'bad negotiating strategy' to allow concessions even before talks begin but said, based on statements thus far, it’s too hard to know what exactly will be at stake. Speaking at NATO headquarters in Brussels on February 13 during a meeting of defense ministers from the alliance's 32 members, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said 'Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks.' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius added: 'For me, it’s clear … that Europe must be involved in the negotiations -- and I think that’s very easy to understand.' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters at a meeting at NATO headquarters on February 13 that any agreement must involve Ukraine and Europe. 'Any deal behind our backs will not work,' she said. Hegseth, who is also attending the meeting, was quick to defend Trump's initiative, saying 'there is a recognition that the whole world and the United States is invested and interested in peace. A negotiated peace.' 'That will require both sides recognizing things they don't want to,' he added. Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula, and its forces have been pushing forward in the eastern Donbas region for months, albeit at a massive cost, while pounding civilian targets nationwide. Hegseth, who is on his first foreign trip since being confirmed late last month, has stressed in recent days that Ukraine should prepare for a negotiated peace settlement and that Europe must provide the 'overwhelming share' of aid to Ukraine. A settlement can be backed up by international troops but, Hegseth said U.S. forces would not be part of any security guarantee in a peace settlement. Key Munich Conference Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is nearing its three-year mark later this month and diplomacy is heating up ahead of the February 14-16 Munich Security Conference, which Zelenskyy and senior U.S. officials plan to attend. In another diplomatic push, Zelenskyy met in Kyiv on February 12 with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss a potential deal on Ukraine's critical minerals and said he hopes the two countries can reach an agreement on the matter at the conference in Munich. Trump has said the United States wants access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals. Bessent presented Zelenskyy with an initial draft agreement and said a deal on the minerals could leave Ukraine with a 'security shield' once the war with Russia is over. Zelenskyy has stressed that strong Western security guarantees for Ukraine with U.S. involvement are crucial to any deal to end the war. Trump said that he expects to meet Putin, probably in Saudi Arabia, saying it would take place 'in the not too distant future.' He added that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would also be involved.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PBdQg8neiB2t	2025-02-13T16:04:06-08:00	
Calls Grow For US To Counter Chinese Control, Influence In Wester...	By Bing X Calls are growing in Washington for action to loosen Beijing’s influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over key infrastructure on the Panama Canal and other port facilities in the Western hemisphere. At a recent meeting of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, Chairman Carlos Jimenez warned that Beijing has 'a strategic position over one of the world’s most important waterways,' referring to the Panama Canal. He said this gives the Chinese Communist Party an opportunity 'to exert influence over commercial shipping, gather intelligence on American and Allied vessel traffic, and potentially restrict the mobility of our Navy in a time of crisis.' Almost half of the leading container ports outside of China have some Chinese ownership or operations, experts told the hearing. Panama has recently announced a government audit of ports owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison conglomerate, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has threatened Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino with potential American retaliation if his country doesn’t immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. 'While Panama has recently announced an audit of Hutchinson ports, that’s simply not enough,' Jimenez told the hearing. 'We don’t need an audit. We need action.' 'The United States cannot and will not accept the scenario where a foreign adversary, one that openly seeks to undermine our global standing, controls infrastructure critical to us, homeland security, military readiness and economic stability,' he said. He said U.S. allies should distance themselves from China, including from Chinese state-owned enterprises. While Mulino insists that the neutrality regime under the Panama Canal treaty has not been violated, two Panamanian lawyers have filed a lawsuit with the country’s supreme court, arguing that the contract allowing Hutchison, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings, to operate terminals in Balboa, on the Pacific side, and Cristobal on Atlantic side of the Panama Canal is unconstitutional, World Cargo News reported on Feb. 5. Dual-use military and civilian operations Experts told the Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 11 that there are concerns around dual-use military and civilian operations in any port with a Chinese corporate presence, not just in Panama. Chinese companies have established full or partial ownership of port facilities in seven countries in the Western Hemisphere: the Bahamas, Brazil, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru and the United States. China COSCO Shipping Corp. and China Merchants Group -- both state-owned conglomerates owned and controlled by the Chinese government -- hold eight of those investments, with Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison holds seven, according to testimony by Isaac Kardon, Senior Fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'China’s presence in U.S. ports presents unquantified but material risks to critical maritime and transportation infrastructure,' Kardon told the meeting. 'The more pressing concerns involve vulnerabilities introduced by Chinese made equipment and software embedded in port systems,' he said. 'Even facilities not owned or operated by Chinese firms, often rely on [Chinese-made] made technologies, for example, ship-to-shore cranes.' 'Under Beijing’s highly acquisitive data governance regime and comparatively high levels of control over [Chinese] firms, these systems enable intelligence collection and surveillance and may cause delay or disruption to the critical operations of us,' Kardon said. But he warned that 'unwinding it recklessly will do more harm than good.' Between 2010 and 2019, Chinese companies plowed US$11 billion into overseas ports and around US$130 billion into subsidies for its shipping companies $130 billion, according to a recent analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations. One distinctive feature, according to written testimony from Ryan C. Berg, Director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is that more than half of China’s ports tend to sit on major shipping lanes and strategic chokepoints. China-backed companies now operate port terminals in at least three locations in Mexico, the Hutchison Ports in the Panama Canal along with a recently opened megaport in Chancay, Peru, Berg said, citing plans for a deepwater port in St. John’s Harbor, Antigua and Barbuda. Almost half of the leading container ports outside of China have some Chinese ownership or operations, and 'Beijing intends to become a 'pier competitor' by setting up a string of dual-use ports that can serve as an extensive international network of infrastructure for People’s Liberation Army vessels,' he wrote. China’s military-civil fusion strategy could also bring commercial espionage and military security risks, including radar and GPS jamming, physical blockades, and even containerized weapon systems, Berg said. Threats to American security Meanwhile, former CIA analyst Matthew Kroenig warned that China’s port investments, including those in Peru and Panama, 'pose a number of threats to U.S. homeland security.' 'China could restrict or block access to ports, threatening American trade and economic wellbeing,' Kroenig testified. 'In the event of a crisis or war, China could hinder the passage of American naval vessels, undermining American war plans.' China could also use deep water ports to host People’s Liberation Army Navy vessels, enabling the projection of military power into the Western Hemisphere, warned, adding that Chinese-operated ports are already used to facilitate the shipment of fentanyl precursors to the United States. Kroenig called on Washington to put pressure on its neighbors to adopt a 'de-risking' strategy toward China, including 'hard decoupling' from China in sensitive areas like critical infrastructure, while providing them with viable alternatives. Berg called for a 'port buyback' scheme financed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and multilateral financial institutions 'to help countries terminate agreements early and entice more transparent operators to bid on concessions.' Cary Davis, President & CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities, also called on the United States to offer alternatives to Chinese investments. 'If we want to counter Chinese influence at ports and secure a safe and prosperous economic future, we must provide a strong, attractive alternative through robust American investment,' he told the Committee. Congress could also offer financial incentives to trusted allies to enable them to purchase cargo-handling equipment not made in China, he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PO6NLuv7Kb5m	2025-02-13T16:01:08-08:00	
Global Powers Must Support Africa In Climate Change Fight – OpEd	Climate change is not just an environmental issue, it is a global crisis with economic, social and security implications. Nowhere is this crisis more evident than in Africa, a continent that contributes a minimal amount to global greenhouse gas emissions yet suffers disproportionately from climate-related disasters. Reports from the World Meteorological Organization and the UN confirm that Africa bears an increasingly heavy burden from climate change, with adaptation costs rising and economic stability at risk. Global powers must recognize that helping Africa combat climate change is not merely an act of goodwill — it is an essential strategy for securing global economic and political stability. Africa’s vulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by its limited adaptive capacity and reliance on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture. The continent has witnessed rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall patterns and extreme weather events, including severe droughts, floods and cyclones. According to recent findings, these environmental changes are drastically affecting local ecosystems and the livelihoods of millions. Farmers in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are witnessing dramatic changes in their environment. Many have reported a decline in predictable rainfall, leading to poor harvests, food shortages and economic hardship. Some regions that were once fertile are now experiencing desertification, forcing communities to abandon their traditional agricultural practices. The consequences are dire. Water scarcity, declining fish stocks and land degradation are increasing competition for resources, often leading to conflicts and displacement. The UN estimates that millions of Africans will be forced to migrate due to climate-induced changes, leading to overpopulated cities, heightened social tensions and increased strain on already-fragile economies. According to the World Meteorological Organization, if effective measures are not implemented, more than 100 million people living in extreme poverty in Africa — surviving on less than $1.90 per day — could face severe threats from droughts, floods and extreme heat by 2030. But climate change is not just an environmental issue for Africa, it is also a major economic crisis. Many African economies depend heavily on agriculture, a sector highly susceptible to climate variations. As droughts have become more frequent and unpredictable rainfall has disrupted traditional farming cycles, gross domestic product growth in several African nations has slowed. Reports indicate that Africa’s economic growth, which is forecast to increase from 3.4 percent in 2024 to 4 percent by 2026, is under severe threat from climate change. Persistent droughts and floods are wiping out crops and livestock, devastating smallholder farmers who form the backbone of many African economies. The loss of agricultural productivity reduces food supply, drives up prices and increases hunger and malnutrition. Beyond agriculture, infrastructure damage caused by extreme weather events is imposing massive costs on African governments. Floods are destroying roads, bridges and power grids, while rising temperatures are stressing energy systems. The financial burden of rebuilding after climate disasters diverts critical resources from essential services such as healthcare and education, deepening existing inequalities. In spite of being responsible for only about 3.8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, Africa is bearing some of the worst consequences of climate change. This glaring disparity underscores the ethical and practical responsibility of global powers — especially high-emitting countries — to assist Africa in combating climate change. However, this is not just about fairness. The reality is that climate change in Africa has repercussions for the entire world. For example, the continent plays a crucial role in global food security. If agricultural production in Africa collapses due to climate change, food shortages will ripple through international markets, driving up prices and causing instability elsewhere. Moreover, climate-induced migration is a growing concern. As environmental conditions worsen, millions of Africans will be forced to seek refuge in urban centers or even abroad, increasing pressure on neighboring countries and Europe. If left unaddressed, climate-driven displacement could contribute to geopolitical tensions, economic instability and humanitarian crises beyond Africa’s borders. But Africa’s vulnerability to climate change is not solely due to environmental factors, it is also the result of economic limitations. Many African nations lack the financial and technological resources to implement large-scale climate adaptation strategies. In other words, the costs associated with climate adaptation are disproportionately high for African countries. A lack of access to climate financing means that many nations struggle to invest in crucial infrastructure improvements, such as better irrigation systems, renewable energy and disaster preparedness. While developed nations have the resources to buffer against climate shocks, African governments are often forced to divert already-limited funds from essential services to address climate-related damages. As a result, without external financial and technical assistance, Africa’s ability to cope with climate change will remain limited. Climate adaptation must be treated as a global responsibility, with wealthier nations playing a key role in providing funding, technology transfers and capacity-building initiatives. Global powers ought to understand that investing in Africa’s climate resilience is not just about charity — it is an investment in global stability and economic security. Supporting Africa’s transition to renewable energy, for example, will contribute to worldwide emission reduction targets while opening up new markets for green technology investments. In addition, helping African countries build climate resilience can also prevent wider economic crises. When African economies suffer due to climate disasters, the ripple effects extend globally, affecting international trade, commodity markets and financial stability. By fostering economic resilience in Africa, leading powers can help ensure a more stable and prosperous global economy. Furthermore, addressing climate-induced migration at its source — by improving living conditions and economic opportunities in Africa — can reduce the strain on global refugee systems. Instead of dealing with the humanitarian crises that result from forced migration, proactive investment in Africa can mitigate the root causes of displacement. In a nutshell, climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing Africa, disproportionately affecting its economies, food security and population stability. Despite contributing minimally to the problem, African nations are bearing the brunt of climate disasters and have limited resources to cope. Global powers ought to step up and recognize their responsibility in assisting Africa. Supporting climate adaptation efforts on the continent is not just about fairness — it is about securing global economic stability, preventing geopolitical crises and fostering sustainable development for all. In other words, by helping Africa, the world ultimately helps itself.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PCVDYOUiYon8	2025-02-13T15:59:09-08:00	
Philippine Agency Recommends Charges Against VP Duterte Over Marc...	By Camille Elemia The Philippines’ top investigative agency is recommending that Vice President Sara Duterte be charged for an alleged threat she made against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. by openly talking about having him and two others assassinated. The potential charges that the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed with the Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ) are separate from the upcoming impeachment trial of Duterte, a former ally of Marcos and daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte. The Senate could convene as an impeachment court in July. It’s now up to the DOJ to decide whether to conduct a preliminary investigation and bring charges via the courts against Duterte – the first vice president in the Philippines to be impeached. Duterte committed one count of inciting to sedition and three counts of grave threats, the NBI alleges. If convicted of the potential charges, the vice president could face penalties, including imprisonment. 'The vice president’s threatening statements disrupted peace,' NBI Director Jaime Santiago told a press briefing on Wednesday as the bureau announced that it was recommending charges against Duterte, based on an agency investigation over the past several months. 'It is now in the DOJ’s court whether they will see merits in our findings or they will dismiss it,' Santiago said. In November, Duterte publicly said that she had hired someone to target Marcos as well as first lady Liza Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez – President Marcos’ cousin – in the event she might herself be killed in an assassination plot. Duterte later said that her statement was taken out of context. In response to the NBI’s announcement, Duterte said she was not expecting fair treatment under the justice department of the Marcos administration, as she pointed to the president’s recent statement describing her remarks as inciting 'criminal' acts. 'As expected,' Duterte said in a brief statement on Wednesday. 'You can see the President’s message, stating that he will not tolerate such criminal acts. This shows that the President’s pronouncements already carry a certain bias.' The DOJ said it assigned the case to prosecutors who would determine whether a case could go to court with a 'certainty of conviction.' 'The case will undergo case buildup as needed to assure that there is sufficient evidence and that the respondent is not unduly hauled to court,' the department said in a statement. Inciting to sedition are statements 'that pose a real and imminent threat to public order, regardless of whether actual unrest occurs' while grave threats refer to statements that create 'real and imminent danger to specific persons, regardless of whether actual harm occurs,' the DOJ said. 'The law does not require that an unlawful act be carried out – only that the statement was made with the intent to stir public unrest or disrupt stability,' it added. Last week, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Duterte for alleged constitutional violations, plotting to assassinate Marcos, corruption, and other high crimes. Duterte has denied any wrongdoing and blamed her political foes for the issues against her. If the Senate – sitting as an impeachment court – convicts Duterte, she will be removed as vice president and be perpetually disqualified from holding any office. Marcos, Duterte’s running mate in the 2022 national elections, has distanced himself from the impeachment proceedings against Duterte. However, his cousin, Romualdez, and his eldest son, Congressman Ferdinand Alexander Marcos, were among House members who endorsed the complaint against the vice president. On Monday, Senate President Francis Escudero said the impeachment trial could begin after Marcos delivered his annual speech before Congress on July 21. Congress is currently on a break ahead of the midterm elections in May, and will not resume sessions until June 2 – a month after new senators would have been elected. Half of the 24-member Senate, which will decide the vice president’s fate, is up for grabs in the May 12 polls. Duterte’s impeachment marked a dramatic turn. It blew up an already wide-open feud that doomed a once formidable alliance between the politically influential Marcoses and Dutertes during the 2022 general election. The alliance between Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte – both the children of ex-presidents – ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the government to allow an international investigation into the deadly drug war waged by Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte. After an all-out feud broke out with President Marcos, Sara Duterte said she was planning to run for president in 2028. Jojo Riñoza in Manila contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PFJB1Dgb_-Yx	2025-02-13T15:56:30-08:00	
Ukraine From ‘Win-Win’ To ‘Lose-Lose’ Scenario – OpEd	US Seeks Compensation for US Aid for Ukraine. Will NATO members providing aid to Ukraine also seek their Pound or Euro share? 'Ukraine ‘may be Russian someday'; Trump made the comment in an interview on 10th Feb with US broadcaster Fox News, as he discussed the three-year old conflict that has followed Russia’s full-scale invasion. America First : Rising President Trump also reiterated that he wants compensation for the aid the US has provided to Ukraine in the form of access to rare earth minerals.' And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500bn worth of rare earth.' Ukraine, meanwhile, has suggested it is open to an agreement that would see Washington compensated for continued military and financial aid. US National Security Advisor talked about the future of US support for Ukraine in a recent interview, during which he claimed, 'We need to recoup those costs, and that is going to be a partnership with the Ukrainians in terms of their rare earth, their natural resources, and their oil and gas and also buying ours.' According to a Reuters report on 10th Feb, the US also plans to push European allies to buy more American weapons for Ukraine ahead of potential peace talks with Russia! From 'Non-Refundable Aid' to 'Resource Swaps,' to 'Shared Responsibility' NATO members need to foot the bill. Meaning 'No Free Lunches' on its USAID Menu. The US policy of Resource Swaps that Ukraine offer rare earth minerals as a form of payment for financial support in the Ukraine-Russia is not new. US Senator Lindsey Graham had stated last year that the US stands to financially gain from Ukraine's vast agricultural sector and 'two to seven trillion dollars' worth' of rare earth minerals. 'This war is about money.' Ukraine is the richest country in all of Europe for rare earth minerals. The Truth, the former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken - while speaking in a joint Press Conference with Britain Foreign Secretary: 'If you look at the investments that we made in Ukraine’s defense to deal with this aggression, 90 percent of the security assistance we provided has actually been spent here in the US with our Military-Industrial Complex manufacturers for production, and that’s produced more American jobs, more growth in our own economy'. The Ukrainian Media has also claimed only a third of aid reaches Ukraine. Blinken calls 'US war aid to Ukraine a ‘Win-Win’ that we need to continue. War for Profit.' Victoria Nuland, former US Under Secretary of State said, 'We have to remember that the bulk of this money is going right back into this economy to make those weapons…' (CNN interview) Today, the US has openly put a price tag on its support for Ukraine, the 'US Aid' fully exposes its selfish nature. The US has not made any contributions to resolving the Russia-Ukraine war; instead, it has exploited the situation for its own benefits. Ukraine's rare earth resources and the Europe's arms orders have all become targets for US exploitation. The world is looking up to President Trump’s promise to end the war. ‘Trump Trend’ of ‘Quid Pro Quo’ : 'Seeking their Share' This ‘Trump Trend’ of ‘Quid Pro Quo’ set in motion 'Seeking their Share' will encourage NATO members also 'Seeking their Share.' for providing aid to Ukraine will expect economic returns. Most of the military and economic aid given to Ukraine has been in the form of grants, not loans. Countries like the US, Germany, and the UK have provided billions in military aid, equipment, and financial support without expecting direct repayment or benefits in return so far. NATO members looking at the long-term benefits: Defense Industry Gains: The US and European arms manufacturers are seeing increased demand, both from Ukraine and from NATO countries replenishing their own stockpiles. Reconstruction Contracts: Once the war ends, Ukraine will need massive reconstruction, and Western companies (especially from donor nations) will likely get major contracts. Geopolitical Influence: Strengthening Ukraine against Russia aligns with NATO's broader strategic interests in Europe, reinforcing alliances and deterring future aggression. Frozen Russian Assets: There’s also an ongoing debate about using frozen Russian assets (hundreds of billions held in Western banks) to help Ukraine. If that happens, it might reduce the financial burden on NATO countries. However, President Trump is not likely to endorse this idea. EU Membership: If Ukraine joins the EU, it will integrate more deeply into the European economy, benefiting investors and businesses from NATO nations. Trade, infrastructure, and energy partnerships could emerge, ensuring that supporting Ukraine pays off in the long run. NATO members may not be seeking an immediate 'Pound or Euro' return, they are definitely considering long-term economic, strategic, and political gains. Peace for Ukraine at What Cost? President Trump having spoken to both Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on 12th Feb, and Trump ordered top US officials to begin talks on ending the War in Ukraine. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth He covered the administration’s views on Ukraine’s future borders and defence assurances in Brussels. He made it clear that the US was shifting its focus towards its homeland and the Asia Pacific region, which meant scaling back in Europe! 'We will only end this devastating war – and establish a durable peace', Hegseth told fellow members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 57 countries militarily backing Ukraine, on 12th Feb. A 'Lose-Lose' Scenario for Ukraine: Military Stalemate & Attrition: Despite billions in aid, Ukraine has struggled to achieve major territorial gains. With ammunition shortages and manpower challenges, prolonging the war could weaken Ukraine in the long run. Western Fatigue & Political Shifts :The US and European countries are showing signs of aid fatigue. Political changes the Trump presidency in the US with 'America FirstPolicy' could further reduce support. Economic Strain: Ukraine’s economy is under severe stress, with infrastructure destruction, a declining workforce, and dependence on Western funding. If that support falters, Ukraine could face financial collapse. Russia’s Adaptation: Sanctions haven't crippled Russia as expected. Instead, its economy has adjusted, and its military has adapted to prolonged warfare, making a decisive Ukrainian victory harder. Diplomatic Isolation Risk: If the West US led NATO nations shift toward pressuring Ukraine into negotiations, Ukraine might be forced into a peace deal that doesn't fully restore its territorial integrity, security concerns will leave it in a weakened and vulnerable state. West the US led NATO having raised the bar of a 'Win-Win' situation for Ukraine appears to be leading to a 'Lose-Lose' situation for Ukraine with an interesting shift in the Ukraine conflict's dynamics. Initially, Western support framed the situation as a 'Win-Win' for Ukraine—military aid, economic assistance, and diplomatic backing were supposed to strengthen Ukraine while weakening Russia but it has taken a U Turn with the country devastated in all respects and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rightly has sharply criticized the US proposal to tie future military aid for Ukraine to access to its rare earth resources, calling the move 'Very Egotistic, Very Self-Centered.' Now it is a Wait and Watch Scenario for Zelensky and what future holds for Ukraine and their future is totally dependent on the Trump Administration policies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWegOKASpRXamMoUOrk3WyH_	2025-02-13T09:08:39-08:00	
China’s Rubio Dilemma – Analysis	By Antara Ghosal Singh The appointment of Marco Rubio as the new United States (US) Secretary of State has added a new layer of complexity to China-US relations. Rubio is well-known for his strong views vis-à-vis China during his tenure as a US senator. On many occasions, he severely criticised China's human rights situation, economic policies and its behaviour in international affairs. Within China, Rubio is particularly disliked and referred to as the 'anti-China pioneer'. He has been included in China’s sanctions list twice, and the sanctions have not been lifted to date. Ever since his inauguration as the US Secretary of State, questions have been doing rounds within Chinese strategic circles—will China now consider lifting its sanctions on Rubio to repair Sino-US relations? Since President Trump hinted at visiting China soon, will Rubio be accompanying him? Will his status as US Secretary of State exempt him from sanctions? Will the issue become an obstacle in Trump’s visit, causing further tension in China-US relations? China has officially skirted around the topic, arguing that 'China will firmly safeguard its national interests, …at the same time it is necessary for high-level officials from China and the United States to maintain contact in an appropriate manner.' However, in an intriguing move, shortly after Rubio took office, China officially adjusted the Chinese translation of his name from '卢比奥' to '鲁比奥', which many believe is a gesture of goodwill, paving the way for a lifting of sanctions against him. However, China’s domestic public opinion seems strongly against lifting sanctions against Rubio. They argue that even though he was sanctioned by China twice, he does not seem to repent or mend his ways but has been making trouble for China since he took office as the new US Secretary of State. For example, at the Senate nomination hearing on 16 January, Rubio made comments, claiming that China 'cheated to obtain superpower status' at the expense of the United States, and stressed that the US must help Taiwan implement the 'porcupine strategy' to foil China's effort to attack Taiwan. Then, on 21 January, a day after taking office, he met with top diplomats from Japan, India, and Australia, demonstrating his focus on Asia, especially on issues relating to China. Again, on 22 January, Rubio had his first phone call with Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo, supporting the Philippines in 'condemning' China’s actions in the South China Sea. Also, he travelled to Panama in early February, his first trip abroad since taking office, following which the Panamanian president announced his withdrawal from China's Belt and Road Initiative. As Rubio had a phone call with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, the Chinese strategic community was furious, accusing the US of sowing discord between China and Vietnam. Referring to Secretary Rubio’s actions so far, Chinese observers argue that lifting sanctions against him will make China appear weak and will lead to Chinese sanctions not being taken seriously. Trump has nominated Rubio to the office, and the Senate approved his appointment because the US wanted to provoke and embarrass China. Therefore, China should not fall for popular discourses like 'giving the United States face, so China can win the substance (给美国面子，我们赢里子)' and step back on the issue easily. Given the circumstances, China’s coping strategy seems to be three-fold. First, by embracing a new model for future Sino-US interactions where 'sanctions and dialogue' coexist. That is, without lifting sanctions on the US secretary of state, the two sides continue to communicate through telephone, video conferences, etc., and even hold in-person talks with the help of third-party countries. For example, on 24 January, 2025, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi did have a telephone conversation with Secretary Rubio, where among other things, he issued a strong warning, asking him to behave himself ('好自為之'). Secondly, by focusing on President Trump. Chinese scholars like Zheng Yongnian think that the purpose behind Trump nominating China-hawks like Rubio is to put extreme pressure on China and blackmail or negotiate with China from a position of strength. However, he will not let power fall into their hands, and decision-making power will firmly be with him. No matter how 'anti-China' these politicians are, they cannot make decisions on their own and still have to obey Trump if they do not want to face the fate of Mike Pompeo and others. Therefore, as long as China keeps President Trump pleased, it does not have to worry much about his deputies. Thirdly, China would like to place its hope on the popular discourse in Washington that Rubio would not last long in this key position and would either be sidelined or forced to step down due to factionalism and internal churn within Team Trump. According to Chinese scholar Jin Canrong, a professor at Renmin University, this remains quite a possibility, given the lack of MAGA (Make America Great Again) support for Rubio and his equation with President Trump. The Rubio episode seems to have emerged as one of the first serious hurdles as the US and China explore prospects of a 'negotiated reset' in bilateral ties under Trump 2.0. How both sides work around the issue is worth watching, as this will surely mark the trajectory of US-China relations in the next four years.

Is Malaysia Edging Further Away From Democracy? – Analysis	Anwar Ibrahim’s Peoples’ Justice Party (PKR) proposing non-contesting top two leadership positions Over the last few months, there has been party talk about the top two leadership positions (president and deputy president) not being contested during the upcoming May party elections. Recently the Peoples’ Justice Party (PKR) International Bureau Chair, who is also prime minister Anwar Ibrahim’s personal assistant Shamsol Iskandar Mohd said the objective of no contest of the two top party positions would maintain internal party stability and improve service to the public. Its obvious this is a scheme to sound out the idea through the media to see if they can get away with doing away with party elections for the top two posts. There has been more than a fair-share of political analysts and local pundits who have publicly supported the idea, overwhelming detractors. This has become much easier inside a national media environment that is very pro-government these days. PKR’s pedigree as a democratic party now leaves a lot to be desired, since it was formed after Anwar Ibrahim was imprisoned in 1998. Many party positions are filled with appointed people by the party president, sometimes riding rough-shot over those who were elected as office bearers, disregarding the will of the grassroots membership. Two people, vice president Nurul Izzah Anwar, and deputy president Rafizi Ramli were appointed as division heads of 6 states, eliminating any possibilities of local influence upon the leadership. In addition, a number of PKR members holding positions in Anwar’s cabinet lost their seats in the last general election, and were appointed senators, so they could join the cabinet. Much of the long-held party policy platform held for many years has been disregarded when PKR became the leading party of what is called the ‘unity government’. The party is also tilting towards becoming a Malay-centric party over the last two years, displacing PKR’s once multicultural approach. What some members call ‘secret balloting’ have delivered a primarily Malay cohort of office holders at state level in the 2022 PKR elections. The one and only time it looked like Anwar would be challenged for the position of president eventually led to a split in the party, when the Azmin Ali group left the party, after the fall of the Pakatan Harapan government in 2020. Coming May elections There is obviously some fear within the inner Anwar circle that there might be a challenge to Anwar’s presidency this coming May. Its no secret that a large section of the membership is disillusioned with the direction the party is going, and the poor performance of PKR members of the government. Its also no secret that current deputy president Rafizi Ramli has his eyes on PKR leadership some day in the future. However, its most likely Rafizi is thinking of the post-Anwar period, with clear ideas of how PKR should proceed in the future. Thus, it’s very unlikely Rafizi would make any move in May. Rafizi is hoping that after the Anwar era, PKR is actually salvageable, where he could pick up what is left after the next general election, should PKR not rejoin government. Some within Anwar’s inner circle are paranoid about any potential challenge, and not confident Anwar could have a convincing win, if any challenge occurs. Gauging actual support with PKR for Anwar is an extremely difficult exercise. There are no formal factions, and loyalties within PKR are all over the place. The party hasn’t healed since Azmin left. How far disillusionment might equate into votes against Anwar is just an unknown factor. The large number of staunch Anwaristers are not as vocal before. A large section of PKR membership have just become dormant. Anwar’s best scenario would be to open the top two party positions and his position as president remain unchallenged. This would put him in a very positive light. This would also allow Saifuddin Nasution Ismail to challenge Rafizi for the deputy presidency. However, Rafizi would be most likely be able to hold off such a challenge. A Rafizi win would lift Rafizi’s stature once again, something Anwar wouldn’t like. May is still a long way away, but the clock is ticking and Anwar still hasn’t worked out the best way to go for himself. Edging further away from democracy Given that both the prime minister Anwar Ibrahim may continue as an unelected president of his party, and the deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is a non-elected president of UMNO, both national leaders lack their own respective party mandates. This is just another step in edging Malaysia away from the journey towards a democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf5PXNBU0l5ht	2025-02-12T17:39:08-08:00	
Five Myths About The Corporate Transparency Act – Analysis	By Nate Sibley The bipartisan Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), passed in 2021 during the first Trump administration, mandated the creation of the Beneficial Ownership Information Register (BOIR). The act requires companies to disclose their true owners to the United States Treasury Department to counter widespread misuse of anonymously owned, US-registered shell companies for money laundering and sanctions evasion. Implementing the BOIR will be vital for advancing the Trump administration’s top law enforcement and national security priorities. In particular, it will help disrupt Mexican cartels’ illicit financial networks and dent the profits of the individuals and organizations that fuel the fentanyl and human trafficking crises. Cracking down on shell companies has become increasingly challenging in recent years as the cartels have partnered with Chinese money laundering organizations. With access to China’s vast, opaque financial system and tacit backing from the Chinese Communist Party, these shadowy networks have transformed money laundering methodologies and supercharged the cartels’ profits. US law enforcement agencies need to have every reasonable tool at their disposal to keep up. The BOIR could prove especially useful for enforcing the Trump administration’s planned tariffs. There are already examples of American businesses using shell companies to evade duties. Such cases will surge if the Trump administration introduces tariffs on the scale the president and his officials have discussed. Current Status Unfortunately, legal challenges over the constitutionality of the CTA have suspended Treasury’s implementation of the BOIR. The resulting procedural limbo has confused millions of small business owners. But the registration process will be quick, straightforward, and nonintrusive for most firms. Additionally, efforts in Congress like the Repealing Big Brother Overreach Act seek to scrap the CTA and deprive the Trump administration of this important tool. This campaign has gathered steam for two reasons. First, many small business owners are only now hearing about the CTA and are understandably wary of what appears to be more red tape from Washington. But this is the only time most businesses will have to worry about the act, as companies do not need to update their registrations unless there are changes to ownership. Second, the BOIR is politically vulnerable because it is not yet justifying its existence by contributing to criminal investigations. It may take months or even years before the registry’s transformative role is fully apparent and widely accepted. Unfortunately, the regular workings of the BOIR will not lend themselves to headlines, whereas the arguments against it often do. Below are five popular misconceptions the act’s opponents push. Myth 1: Beneficial ownership information registers do not work. It goes without saying that criminals will commit identity fraud, submit false information, or skip the BOIR form entirely. But countries with registries like the BOIR have found that asking honest small business owners to submit their beneficial ownership data is useful for criminal investigations. A United Kingdom government survey found that law enforcement agencies access the People with Significant Control register, London’s equivalent of the BOIR, on a weekly basis. This is because the absence of a filing or the filing of inaccurate or irregular information can be valuable clues in a criminal investigation. Meanwhile, US officials already use beneficial ownership information about foreign shell companies that other countries provided through BOIR equivalents. This makes it even more absurd that US law enforcement cannot see who is using American shell companies to transfer funds across—and within—US borders. Myth 2: The CTA unduly burdens small businesses. The last thing that America’s overburdened small businesses need is more red tape from Washington. But the BOIR form takes most owners about 10 minutes. It only requires a name, an address, a government identification number, and a picture of the corresponding physical ID. Most owners can then file and forget it because, as noted above, the registry does not require businesses to refile unless ownership changes. There is no fee, and most businesses will not need to involve lawyers or other professionals. More than two-thirds of owners who have already registered found it 'easy,' according to a recent poll. Cutting red tape and unleashing prosperity are rightly top priorities for the Trump administration and 119th Congress. But policymakers could target thousands of other regulations that impose heavier burdens instead of gutting important national security measures like the CTA. Myth 3: The CTA unfairly targets small businesses. Larger businesses are excluded from the CTA for two reasons. First, their ownership structures are usually accessible to law enforcement through the Securities and Exchange Commission or other filings. Second, larger businesses do not share the obvious characteristics of shell companies, which generally list very few employees. Law enforcement can easily identify and contact owners or employees if necessary. Unfortunately, small businesses are harder to distinguish from shell companies because they have fewer employees and may be more difficult to contact. By filing, small business owners effectively rule themselves out of suspicion so that law enforcement can move on to the next line of inquiry without bothering them. Additionally, in cases where criminals have stolen the identity of a legitimate business, the BOIR can help law enforcement identify the real owner and take appropriate action. Myth 4: The CTA is intrusive and dangerous. Data protection, privacy, and the potential for government abuse are legitimate questions about the CTA. But legislators sought to minimize these risks while meeting law enforcement and national security imperatives. The BOIR is a secure, non-public database housed at the US Treasury Department. Treasury officials can grant access to BOIR data in response to requests from other federal officials engaged in national security, intelligence, or law enforcement activity, or to local law enforcement agencies who have obtained a court order. But the requesting party will need to justify the request to demonstrate that it is not a so-called fishing expedition. Improper access would be digitally documented, easily traceable through the system, and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Additionally, US banks will be allowed to check the BOIR to speed up the due diligence process when onboarding consenting customers. In this application, the act may reduce red tape for new small businesses. Of course, there is always the risk of a leak or a hack by hostile actors. But the perpetrator would not gain access to citizens’ private finances or vital information, as some critics seem to suggest. Additionally, federal and local governments already hold the kind of information the BOIR requests in various less secure places. And private companies routinely harvest, misuse, or lose data that is far more sensitive. Myth 5: Honest business owners will be jailed for forgetting to file. The CTA stipulates a civil penalty of $500 for each day that a company remains in violation and criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and five years’ imprisonment. This may seem punitive, but there are crucial caveats. As noted above, agencies can only access BOIR data to support ongoing national security, intelligence, or law enforcement investigations. This means that law enforcement will only notice noncompliance if it is interested in a company for other, more serious reasons. Failure to file must also be 'willful' to beget criminal penalties. This is one of the highest forms of criminal intent under US federal law. Those who simply forget to file, or are unaware that they need to do so, cannot therefore be prosecuted.

How US Tariffs Affect Vietnam’s Economy – Analysis	Vietnam’s steel industry faces a double threat from the U.S. after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose a 25% tax on all steel imports from March 4. It was already being investigated by the U.S. Commerce Department for illegal subsidies and dumping. Vietnam’s aluminum exporters face a similar surcharge. Vietnam is the fifth-largest exporter of steel to the U.S., which is Vietnam’s number three market. It isn’t the first time Trump has imposed such sanctions. In 2018, he imposed a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum imported from Vietnam and several other countries. Impact on Vietnam On Feb. 11, Vietnam’s Doanh Nghiep & Tiep Thi newspaper quoted Do Ngoc Hung, a commercial counselor and head of the Vietnam Trade Office in the U.S. as saying Vietnamese enterprises still had many opportunities to export to the U.S. because its steel and aluminum manufacturers cannot immediately meet domestic demand. However, profit margins would narrow due to higher import charges. The amount of Vietnamese steel exported to the U.S. in 2024 reached nearly 1.7 million tons, worth US$1.3 billion, an increase of over 50% compared with 2023 in terms of both volume and turnover, according to the Vietnam Steel Association as cited on the VietnamBiz news site. Meanwhile, data from the Customs Department show that last year, the import value of iron and steel from other countries to Vietnam reached $19.07 billion, of which 63% was imported from China, worth $12.03 billion. Radio Free Asia emailed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Vietnamese Trade Office in the U.S. to ask about how Trump’s executive order affects Vietnam’s exports but did not receive a response. RFA also asked Vietnamese steel companies Hoa Phat, Hoa Sen and Pomina for comment but they did not reply. Effect on re-exporters Norway-based economist Nguyen Huy Vu told RFA the 25% U.S. tariff would directly affect manufacturers in Vietnam and Chinese companies that use Vietnam to export to the U.S. to avoid existing tariffs. Vu said that the U.S. government’s new tax on aluminum and steel from other countries would cause difficulties for Vietnamese businesses. 'Trump’s imposition of such tariffs will force Vietnamese businesses to reconsider their business strategies. Certainly, businesses that want to build more steel factories will have to rethink,' he said. 'It has its good and bad points. It will affect the big Vietnamese enterprises like Hoa Phat but they will have to reshape their business strategy. Instead of exporting steel, they have to switch to increasing the technology for producing steel and have to switch to producing more valuable products.' The Nhan Dan newspaper reported on Feb. 8 that the Ministry of Transport had submitted to the government a proposal to invest in the construction of a new Lao Cai-Hanoi-Hai Phong railway line worth $8.3 billion to connect Hai Phong port with China to implement China’s 'Belt and Road' initiative and Vietnam’s 'Two Corridors, One Belt' cooperation plan. According to Vu, this railway line will likely serve heavy industries including steel imported directly from China and then exported. Given this new executive order, the Vietnamese government may have to accept the ministry’s proposal for the railway, he said. Possible price cuts Vu said U.S. importers may ask Vietnamese steelmakers to cut prices by up to 20% so they can still make a profit after the 25% tariffs kick in, adding that manufacturers in the United States may keep their prices the same or increase them only slightly. 'It will lead to Vietnamese companies being greatly affected and Chinese companies will not want to invest in Vietnam anymore. Surely Vietnam’s economy will face many difficulties in the coming days,' Vu said. Vietnam’s Ministry of Construction estimates the total annual revenue value of the construction materials, cement, and steel industries at nearly $47 billion, accounting for about 11% of Vietnam’s gross domestic product, or GDP, Vietnamplus reported. Anti-dumping investigation In September 2024, Vietnam’s Department of Trade Defense at the Ministry of Industry and Trade said that the U.S. Department of Commerce was investigating Vietnam, along with other countries, for dumping and subsidies, with the dumping accusation having a margin of up to 160%, the highest in the world. The investigation period is 2023 and the damage assessment period is from 2021 to 2023.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf5gVK6oWe-4F	2025-02-12T17:35:46-08:00	
Russia: Multiple Trials, Convictions, For Criticizing Invasion Of...	By Victoria Arnold Christian preacher Eduard Charov's trial for repeatedly allegedly 'discrediting' the Russian Armed Forces and state bodies is due soon. Buddhist Ilya Vasilyev is on trial for allegedly spreading 'knowingly false information' about the Armed Forces 'on grounds of hatred or enmity'. Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk, tortured while arrested, is under investigation for preaching that 'on the basis of Holy Scripture' Christians should not fight in Ukraine. On 27 January, Christian bard Andrey Buyanov received possibly the largest total fine yet for criticising from a religious perspective Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The trial of an independent Christian preacher for repeatedly allegedly 'discrediting' the Russian Armed Forces and state bodies is due to begin soon at a court in the Urals. The 53-year-old Eduard Charov, who runs a shelter for homeless people, is currently under a ban on leaving his home district and using the telephone and internet. He and his wife think he will be sent to prison. Charov first faced administrative prosecution in the spring of 2023 for comments on social media, including the remark addressed to 'church people': 'would Jesus Christ have gone to kill in Ukraine????!'. His second alleged 'discreditation' offence, for which he is about appear in court, involved reposting a quotation about patriotism which makes no mention of the Russian military or government: 'A patriot is someone who wants to make their country better, the people richer, and the government more honest and fair. Not someone who justifies total destitution and corruption with imaginary greatness and spiritual bonds' (see below). On 28 January, Sverdlovsk Region Prosecutor's Office issued its final indictment charging Charov for 'public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation' more than once in a year, and 'public calls to commit terrorist activities, public justification of terrorism or propaganda of terrorism, using the internet'. The latter charge is for what Charov's wife Inna called a 'sarcastic comment' on another user's post on the VKontakte social network in September 2023 (see below). Sverdlovsk Region Investigative Committee has refused to reply to Forum 18's questions about the case (see below). Two other criminal cases are ongoing against individuals who have opposed Russia's war against Ukraine from a religious perspective. The 51-year-old Buddhist leader Ilya Vasilyev is currently on trial in Moscow on charges of spreading 'knowingly false information' about the Russian Armed Forces 'on grounds of hatred or enmity' (see below). Vasilyev, who has been in detention since 22 June 2024, is being prosecuted for an English-language Facebook post about Russian rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities. He made the post – and others for which he was previously administratively prosecuted – 'solely out of religious conviction', his lawyer told Forum 18. If convicted, Vasilyev could be imprisoned for 5 to 10 years or be fined 3 million to 5 million Roubles. He is next due to appear in court on 11 February 2025 (see below). Moscow City Prosecutor's Office has not replied to Forum 18's questions about the case (see below). In October 2024, a Moscow Region Pentecostal pastor became the first person to be accused of publicly calling for actions 'against state security' for speaking out against Russia's war against Ukraine from a religious perspective (see below). Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk, who is now 62, preached a sermon in September 2022 in which he explicitly stated that, 'on the basis of Holy Scripture', Christians should not go to fight in Ukraine. Because the sermon was livestreamed and then uploaded to his church's YouTube channel, he is under investigation for 'Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation' 'with the use of mass media, or electronic, or information and telecommunication networks, including the internet' (see below). Armed men raided Pastor Romanyuk's home and those of several other church members on 18 October 2024. While arresting Romanyuk, the armed officials tortured him by striking him on the side of the head, causing fluid to leak from his ear, his daughter Svetlana Zhukova stated (see below). It is unclear which security agencies carried out the raids and which is investigating Pastor Romanyuk's case. None of the Moscow Region branches of the Investigative Committee and the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Federal Investigative Committee, nor the Moscow Region National Guard (Rosgvardiya) has replied to Forum 18's questions about the case (see below). On 27 January 2025, 44-year-old Christian bard and songwriter Andrey Buyanov received what appears to be the largest total fine yet for criticising Russia's war against Ukraine from a religious perspective. Moscow's Nagatino District Court issued 10 separate guilty verdicts on charges of 'Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation' for different posts Buyanov made on VKontakte between June 2023 and March 2024. The posts included anti-war songs and poems, reposts of other users' material, and observations on opposition politician Aleksey Navalny's funeral (see below). In the written court decisions, seen by Forum 18, the amount of each fine is redacted. For this offence, possible fines range from 30,000 to 50,000 Roubles, meaning that Buyanov could have been fined anything from 300,000 to 500,000 Roubles overall. A fine of 300,000 Roubles would represent about 2 months' average wage in Moscow (see below). The posts which led to Buyanov's multiple prosecutions were found during internet monitoring in December 2024 by the Interior Ministry's Counter-Extremism Centre, which described them as 'extremist materials'. They included poems and songs, mostly of his own composition and all critical of Russia's war against Ukraine. For example, on 1 March 2024, Buyanov made 'a post supporting [Aleksey Navalny] with condemnation of the actions of the Russian Armed Forces during the Special Military Operation', one verdict stated, with two photos 'showing a church near which people have gathered for the purpose of holding a mass protest against the activities of the Russian Federation' (see below). Buyanov wrote: 'I admire the People who were not afraid and came to the funeral service and burial of [Navalny]. It's a symbolic video – against the backdrop of a church, People chant what should have been heard in churches all these 2 years: 'No to war!' But it is not heard. The voice of God, banished from the churches..' (see below). Moscow's Nagatino District Court has not replied to Forum 18's questions about the case. Charges and punishments Soon after Russia launched its renewed invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Vladimir Putin introduced new offences in order to prosecute those opposing the war for any reason, including on religious grounds. These included – but were not limited to – Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 and the associated Criminal Code Article 280.3 introduced on 4 March 2022 to punish alleged 'discreditation' of the Armed Forces. Amendments to the law on 25 March 2022 expanded the definition of this offence to include 'discreditation' of 'the execution by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers for the specified purposes', ie. protecting Russian interests and 'maintaining international peace and security'. The government has used a range of tactics to pressure religious leaders into supporting the renewed invasion of Ukraine. These tactics include warnings to senior and local religious leaders, and prosecuting and fining religious believers and clergy who have publicly opposed the war. Similar warnings and prosecutions have been used against many Russians who express opposition to the war for any reason. Since February 2022, courts have jailed two and fined three on criminal charges for opposing Russia's war against Ukraine on religious grounds. Investigators have also opened three criminal cases against people who have left Russia, and have placed them on the Federal Wanted List. Many others who publicly or online protested against the war have been fined under the Administrative Code. Repeat anti-war 'offences' can lead to prosecution under the Criminal Code, which brings the possibility of jail terms. Ever-increasing internet censorship has seen websites and materials blocked for: 'extremist' content; opposition to Russia's war against Ukraine from a religious perspective; material supporting LGBT+ people in religious communities; Ukraine-based religious websites; social media of prosecuted individuals; and news and NGO sites which include coverage of freedom of religion or belief violations. Eduard Charov: Prosecutors send case to court On 28 January, Sverdlovsk Region Prosecutor's Office issued its final indictment in the criminal case against independent Christian preacher Eduard Aleksandrovich Charov (born 18 July 1971). The document, seen by Forum 18, indicates that prosecutors have charged Charov under both Criminal Code Article 280.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation' more than once in a year) and Criminal Code Article 205.3, Part 2 ('Public calls to commit terrorist activities, public justification of terrorism or propaganda of terrorism, using the internet'). Penalties under both these Criminal Code article range from very large fines up to 7 years' imprisonment, and any conviction is also followed by a range of possible other penalties. Under Criminal Code Article 69, if a person is found guilty of more than one crime in the same court process, the judge will decide on separate punishments for each, then add them together partially or in their entirety to form an aggregate sentence. Investigative Committee officials had summoned Charov for questioning on several occasions in December 2024, according to Charov's wife Inna, who administers his VKontakte page, eventually charging him 'in a fabricated case for his anti-war position' on 24 December. Prosecutors have submitted the case to court, an individual following Charov's case confirmed to Forum 18 on 29 January. Krasnoufimsk District Court has not yet listed any hearings on its website. Charov's first 'offence' of 'discreditation' took place in 2022, when, according to court documents, he made multiple posts on VKontakte (since deleted) 'attributing purposefully hostile, violent, discriminatory actions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation against civilians or socially significant objects [and] attributing the commission of war crimes to Russian military personnel on the territory of Ukraine'. According to the Christians Against War Telegram channel, in one of these posts Charov said 'You churchmen/church people! Come to your senses! Understand! Think about it, would Jesus Christ have gone to kill in Ukraine????!' [punctuation original]. In other posts, he apparently also called President Vladimir Putin the Antichrist, according to independent Russian media outlet Mediazona. He also offered sanctuary at the shelter to any reservists fleeing call-up to the army in the 'partial mobilisation', which began in September 2022. On 18 April 2023, Krasnoufimsk District Court fined Charov 45,000 Roubles under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 and 20,000 Roubles under Administrative Code Article 20.3.1 ('Incitement of hatred or enmity'). The fines added up to more than 4 weeks' average wages for Sverdlovsk Region. As Charov is a pensioner with a wife on a disability pension and residents to support in the shelter he runs, the fines were a large burden. According to Investigative Committee documents seen by Forum 18, Charov committed the 'offence' which led to his criminal prosecution on 3 September 2023, when he reposted an image from another user's VKontakte page, which contained the unattributed quotation: 'A patriot is someone who wants to make their country better, the people richer, and the government more honest and fair. Not someone who justifies total destitution and corruption with imaginary greatness and spiritual bonds'. This was judged by unnamed linguistic experts to contain 'linguistic and psychological signs of persuading [readers] of the negative nature of the goals of Russian state bodies' use of their powers, that is, their discreditation'. Forum 18 wrote to Sverdlovsk Region Prosecutor's Office on 31 January 2025, after it had issued its final indictment, asking why reposting a quotation is considered 'discreditation' of the state bodies of the Russian Federation, when the quotation does not mention Russia or any specific state institution, and Charov did not add any comment. Forum 18 also asked what punishment prosecutors would be seeking. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Sverdlovsk Region of 10 February. Forum 18 put the same questions to Krasnoufimsk Interdistrict Prosecutor's Office. Interdistrict Prosecutor Ilya Yefremov responded on 7 February, stating that prosecutors' offices 'do not provide information on interpretation of a legal norm, [or] explanation of its application, development of a legal position upon request'. He added: 'In accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, everyone accused of committing a crime is presumed innocent until their guilt is proven in accordance with the procedure prescribed by federal law and established by a court verdict that has entered into legal force.' He did not answer Forum 18's query. In response to Forum 18's enquiries in July 2024, Sverdlovsk Region Investigative Committee's press service refused to answer questions about the case, saying that information about the investigation 'is not subject to disclosure'. In early February 2024, investigators also opened a case against Charov under Criminal Code Article 205.2, Part 2 ('Public calls to commit terrorist activities, public justification of terrorism or propaganda of terrorism .. committed using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet'). According to his wife Inna, this was because of a 'satirical comment' made in August 2023 on another user's VKontakte post about an act of arson at a military recruitment and enlistment office: 'Award the Order of Courage posthumously with confiscation of property.' Russia's ever-increasing internet censorship increasingly restricts the exercise of freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, and other human rights. The Investigative Committee has placed Charov under specific restrictions, including a ban on using the phone and internet and a ban on leaving his home district without permission. Ilya Vasilyev: Zen Buddhist leader's trial underway The trial of Zen Buddhist leader Ilya Vladimirovich Vasilyev (born 9 December 1973) on charges of spreading 'false information' about the Russian Armed Forces is underway in Moscow. He remains in custody at Matrosskaya Tishina prison, a decision he says has 'destructive religious consequences'. After being delayed three times because of 'improper notification of the accused', according to Vasilyev's support group on Telegram, his first hearing took place at Moscow's Preobrazhensky District Court on 12 December 2024. Vasilyev has since made three further appearances before Judge Valentina Lebedeva. He is next due in court on 11 February 2025, according to the Moscow court system website. Forum 18 asked Moscow City Prosecutor's Office on 3 February what punishment prosecutors would be seeking in the criminal case against Vasilyev. Forum 18 had received no response by the afternoon of the working day in Moscow of 10 February. No verdict is expected before the second half of March, Vasilyev's lawyer Gevorg Aleksanyan told Forum 18 on 28 January. According to the Investigative Committee charging decision of 16 October 2024, seen by Forum 18, the case against Vasilyev is based on an English-language Facebook post of 25 December 2022: 'Putin rejected Christmas armistice. His rockets are right now shelling peaceful Ukrainian cities and towns. Only yesterday 16 people died in Kherson, where my father's family lives. Or lived? Millions of Ukrainians are now without electricity and water supply.' Investigators opened the case against Vasilyev on 20 June 2024 under Criminal Code 207.3 ('Public dissemination of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'), Part 2, Paragraph e ('for reasons of political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or for reasons of hatred or enmity against any social group'). Vasilyev made the Facebook post about attacks on Ukrainian cities, and others on VKontakte which led to an earlier administrative conviction, 'solely out of religious conviction', he told Forum 18 through his lawyer Aleksanyan on 20 November 2024. He added that he is 'not a politician and is engaged only in religion'. At the first full hearing in his trial on 12 December 2024, Vasilyev appeared in the defendant's glass box holding up a copy of the Russian Constitution and a piece of paper with the numbers 28 and 29, SOTAVision noted the same day. This was a reference to Articles 28 and 29 of the Constitution, which respectively guarantee freedom of conscience and religion and freedom of thought and speech. 'Today's trial is not just an examination of a specific charge against Ilya Vasilyev,' lawyer Gevorg Aleksanyan told the court. 'We have gathered to consider a case that concerns much deeper issues: freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and ultimately, the fundamental rights of every citizen of the Russian Federation.' Criminal Code Article 207.3, he observed, is 'actually aimed at people who peacefully express their beliefs against violence and war'. In his own statement in court, Vasilyev agreed that he had made the Facebook post but refused to admit guilt as he does not think that it broke the law. He went on to explain that, having taken the Bodhisattva vow, he was part of the Sangha, 'a single worldwide and indivisible community of followers of the Buddha'. Vasilyev added: 'Persecution of a Sangha member, even when he has broken the law, and in this case the accusation is far-fetched, has consequences for the entire country and state in which the disciple of Buddha is persecuted, and on the contrary, listening to the words of monks and Bodhisattvas, protecting them from injustice and persecution, brings success and prosperity to all.' Vasilyev told the Judge: 'This is an historic process, and more than the fate of this man is now in your hands. Your decision will have consequences that go far beyond the framework of national jurisprudence, including religious consequences.' Ilya Vasilyev: After more than 7 months' detention, judge rejects release Ilya Vasilyev has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina. On 19 November 2024, Judge Valentina Lebedeva of Moscow's Preobrazhensky District Court extended his period of detention by six months to 24 April 2025. He appealed unsuccessfully against this decision on 17 December 2024. Forum 18 wrote to Preobrazhensky District Court and Moscow City Court on 31 January to ask why judges had decided that Vasilyev should continue to be kept in custody. Forum 18 put the same question to Moscow City Prosecutor's Office on 3 February. Forum 18 had received no responses by the afternoon of the working day in Moscow of 10 February. While in detention, Vasilyev 'meditates in his cell on Wednesdays, many Buddhists write him letters of support. He also reads religious literature whenever possible,' his lawyer Gevorg Aleksanyan told Forum 18. At his 17 December 2024 appeal against his detention, Vasilyev noted that he had been forced to celebrate a major Buddhist holiday (Bodhi Day, the day of the Buddha's enlightenment) on 8 December in the detention centre, rather than at home, where he has an altar. 'The [lower court] resolution says 'There are not enough guarantees of proper behaviour .. But what about the presumption of innocence?', the independent SOTAVision news outlet reported Vasilyev as saying. 'Moscow pre-trial detention centres are overcrowded, people sleep here on folding beds, they sleep in turns. Why should I take up space here when there isn't enough?' His detention has 'destructive religious consequences', Vasilyev added. Vasilyev's address in pre-trial detention is: 107076 g. Moskvaul.

Moskve Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk: Detention extended Pentecostal pastor Nikolay Nikolayevich Romanyuk (born 15 August 1962) is still under investigation under Criminal Code Article 280.4 ('Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation'), Part 2, Paragraph c 'with the use of mass media, or electronic, or information and telecommunication networks, including the internet'). It is unknown whether he has been formally charged or when his case is likely to reach court, and he remains in detention despite ill health. Pastor Romanyuk is facing prosecution because he gave a sermon at the Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church in Balashikha on 25 September 2022, the first Sunday after President Vladimir Putin announced the 'partial mobilisation' of Russian army reservists. Romanyuk called on fellow Christians not to take part in the war against Ukraine. The service was livestreamed on the church's YouTube channel and the recording subsequently made available on YouTube and VKontakte. Investigators carried out armed raids on several other church members' homes on the same day as Pastor Romanyuk's, as well as at the church itself and on church property in Volokolamsk. Forum 18 has twice sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the FSB security service, asking in what way Pastor Romanyuk's sermon threatened state security, why he had been placed in detention, whether any criminal or administrative cases had been opened against any other church members, and why officials deemed it necessary to carry out armed raids on their homes. Forum 18 had received no response by the afternoon of the working day in Moscow of 10 February. The Memorial Human Rights Centre named Pastor Romanyuk a political prisoner on 31 October 2024. Investigators had Pastor Romanyuk placed in detention for an initial period of two months at a court hearing on 20 October 2024. On 11 December 2024, Balashikha City Court extended this to 16 February 2025. Moscow Regional Court upheld the decision on 16 January 2025. 'Of course, we filed an appeal,' Pastor Romanyuk's daughter Svetlana Zhukova, the church's choir director, wrote on her Telegram channel on 15 December 2024, referring to the initial detention order. 'Because it is obvious (for us) that a pensioner, a father of many children, a pastor of a church, a person who does not have good health, and simply a citizen of the Russian Federation, who has never committed any offence in his entire life – could definitely be left under a written undertaking not to leave, or at least house arrest, since they give such an opportunity to people who commit real crimes.' Zhukova and her husband, Romanyuk's fellow pastor Roman Zhukov describe how Romanyuk became ill in the detention centre and suffered difficulty lifting his left arm, nausea, and general weakness. They say the detention centre staff helped him and had him taken to hospital, where he spent a few days in intensive care, having had a mini-stroke. But investigators 'still dragged him to court, because he is a terrible state criminal', Zhukov noted on 13 December 2024. Pastor Romanyuk wrote to his family from the detention centre later in December 2024 saying that he was recovering. He is 'physically weak (he has lost almost 30kg), but so resilient, with a very clear position, with a strong faith that even strengthens us', his daughter Svetlana Zhukova wrote on 16 January 2025. Despite Pastor Romanyuk's health problems and his lawyer's insistence that he would not abscond, both the lower and regional courts ruled that he should remain in custody. Forum 18 wrote to Balashikha City Court and Moscow Regional Court on 31 January 2025, asking why it was necessary to keep Pastor Romanyuk in detention and in what way he could be considered dangerous. Moscow Regional Court responded on 3 February, confirming only that it had upheld the lower court decision, and not answering Forum 18's questions.

Russia is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This defines torture as 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity'. Under the Convention, Russia is obliged both to arrest any person suspected on good grounds of having committed, instigated or acquiesced to torture 'or take other legal measures to ensure his [sic] presence', and also to try them under criminal law which makes 'these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature'. An explanatory note added in July 2022 to Russian Criminal Code Article 286 ('Exceeding official authority') repeats the first part of this definition of torture almost verbatim. It does not include the section 'when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity'. As the UN Committee against Torture (CAT) noted in its Concluding Observations on Russia in August 2018 (CAT/C/RUS/CO/6), repeating its 2012 Concluding Observations recommendation: 'The Committee once again urges the State party to criminalize torture as an independent crime. The State party should also ensure that its definition of torture fully conforms to article 1 of the Convention, that the penalties for torture in its laws reflect the grave nature of the crime, as set out in the Committee's general comment No. 2 (2007) on the implementation of article 2, and that perpetrators are not charged solely with other crimes which carry lower maximum penalties and are subject to statutes of limitations.' Multiple torture cases, impunity for torturers Torture by Russia's 'security' apparatus is common, with a long standing pattern of impunity for torturers. The UN Committee against Torture also noted in its 2018 Concluding Observations (CAT/C/RUS/CO/6) that 'it is concerned that police and prison doctors reportedly often failed or refused to conduct a proper and confidential examination of injuries sustained from torture or ill-treatment and that a prisoner's request to receive an independent medical examination was often rejected by the prison administration'. Torture cases with impunity of torturers include those responsible for torturing Jehovah's Witnesses in multiple cases, and those responsible for torturing a Muslim who met other Muslims to study the works of theologian Said Nursi. In one such case in Surgut the suspect torturers of Jehovah's Witnesses were given 'best local department head' and 'best investigator' awards, ostensibly for their work before the torture took place. In another case, in April 2024 prisoner of conscience Rinat Kiramov was tortured by fellow medical facility prisonersover four days after he refused to give names of fellow Jehovah's Witnesses in his home town. They punched, kicked, waterboarded, threatened with rape, and shocked him with a stun gun. It is unclear how the prisoners had access to a stun gun. Officials have repeatedly replied to Forum 18's questions about torture by either not answering, or asserting that no torture took place, or that a case has not been opened against the suspect torturers. Forum 18 sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the FSB security service, as well as to the Moscow Region branch of the National Guard (Rosgvardiya, which typically provides armed support to investigators in such situations), asking why officers had tortured Romanyuk and whether the personnel who had done so had been placed under investigation. Forum 18 had received no response by the afternoon of the working day in Moscow of 10 February. Armed raids on Romanyuk's family and church members' homes No one else yet appears to be facing criminal or administrative prosecution over Pastor Romanyuk's September 2022 sermon. Nevertheless, investigators carried out armed raids on the homes of several members of his family and church on the day of his arrest on 18 October 2024. Romanyuk's daughter Svetlana Zhukova describes in detail on her Telegram channel how armed men arrived shortly after 6am, their knocks 'shaking our entire wooden house'. The armed men did not explain who they were or what they wanted, and searched the house, including the children's rooms. 'Going down the stairs in fear, I saw my husband [Roman Zhukov] in the hallway with horror. He was lying on his stomach, his legs in the house, his torso over the threshold – on the street. Around him was some kind of crowd of people in full military uniform, shields, helmets,' Zhukova wrote on 13 December 2024. 'Machine guns were aimed at my husband, I saw a laser sight on his back. He holds his hands behind his head, lying on the floor.' The armed men then demanded to see her 17-year-old son Kirill, whom they forced to stand barefoot on the veranda with his face to the wall. 'Weapons were also aimed at him,' Zhukova noted. 'I want to record the moment: we didn't know who these bandits were. Thieves? Terrorists? Murderers? Who has come? Armed men broke into our house, there were 10-12 of them. No one identified himself. 'I have told this story on many occasions during this time, but now, as I write all this, I am simply shaking. My stomach convulses and everything just freezes, shrinking inside into a huge lump that paralyses my body, involuntarily tensing all my muscles..' The searchers confiscated documents, a laptop, and phones. 'We immediately began to encounter huge inconveniences [because of this],' Zhukova wrote on 20 December 2025. She noted that they could no longer log into public services portals. 'Our life – study, work – is simply impossible now without technology. In the end, one wonderful sister from the church offered me her old device, which really, really helped me out for some time.. And Kirill just bought himself a phone with the money he saved up.. In general, we have begun to live in some slightly different reality.' Moscow: Record administrative fines On 27 January 2025, a Moscow court handed Andrey Alekseyevich Buyanov (born 21 June 1980) what appears to be the largest total fine yet for criticising Russia's war against Ukraine from a religious perspective. Moscow's Nagatino District Court issued 10 separate guilty verdicts under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation') for different posts Buyanov made on VKontakte between June 2023 and March 2024. The posts included anti-war songs and poems, reposts of other users' material, and observations on Aleksey Navalny's funeral. In the written court decisions, seen by Forum 18, the amount of each fine is redacted. For this offence, possible fines range from 30,000 to 50,000 Roubles, meaning that Buyanov could have been fined anything from 300,000 to 500,000 Roubles overall. A fine of 300,000 Roubles would represent about 2 months' average wage in Moscow. Buyanov, a Christian bard and songwriter, was present in court for all 10 consecutive five-minute hearings before Judge Gayane Akopyan, and 'recognised his guilt', according to the verdicts. The posts which led to Buyanov's multiple prosecutions were found during internet monitoring in December 2024 by the Interior Ministry's Counter-Extremism Centre, which described them as 'extremist materials'. They include poems and songs, mostly of his own composition and all critical of Russia's war against Ukraine, as well as comments about Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, and the late opposition politician Aleksey Navalny (whose name is redacted in the written decisions). On 1 March 2024, Buyanov made 'a post supporting [Aleksey Navalny] with condemnation of the actions of the Russian Armed Forces during the Special Military Operation', one verdict stated, with two photos 'showing a church near which people have gathered for the purpose of holding a mass protest against the activities of the Russian Federation'. Buyanov wrote: 'I admire the People who were not afraid and came to the funeral service and burial of [Navalny]. It's a symbolic video – against the backdrop of a church, People chant what should have been heard in churches all these 2 years: 'No to war!' But it is not heard. The voice of God, banished from the churches..' On 17 February 2024, the day after Navalny's death, Buyanov wrote 'The Kingdom of Heaven to the murdered sufferer Aleksey.. This state has been killing people every day for two years now. Every day. And how much longer will this continue? The Church is not only silent, but also approves (not all, but the loud-mouthed elite).' On 3 March 2024, Buyanov posted a photograph of the aftermath of a fatal Russian drone strike in Odesa: 'This wonderful family of Evangelical Christians was destroyed along with the entrance of a residential building in Odessa [sic], which yesterday .. was hit by a Russian UAV-pilot-shahed. 32-year-old [redacted name] together with 4-month-old Timofey were found under the rubble - the young mother was pressing her son to her chest, so together they passed into Eternity. The service dog Tara, who found the bodies of the dead in the ruins, lay down and cried.. [Redacted name]'s husband and daughter Lizi were in another room during the attack and miraculously managed to survive.' On 19 August 2023, Buyanov quoted another VKontakte user's post about the Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv which had taken place that day, on which Orthodox Christians marked the festival of Transfiguration: 'Transfiguration. People are returning from a festive service in churches - dressed up, with children, with baskets of blessed apples.. And – an explosion! This is how 'Orthodox' Russians 'congratulated' glorious Chernigov [sic] on the holiday. Are there still those who do not understand something?! Tell me about 'brothers', about 'one people', go ahead, try, damned Satanists.. As a result of this Russian missile strike on Chernigov, 7 people were killed and 129 people were injured, 15 of whom were children. Thirty minutes ago, a six-year-old boy died in hospital from his injuries'.' Forum 18 wrote to Moscow's Nagatino District Court on 6 February to ask why such posts were considered to 'discredit' the Russian armed forces, and what fines Buyanov has received. Forum 18 had received no response by the afternoon of the working day in Moscow of 10 February.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnfwpOJrmPoFSU	2025-02-12T17:34:31-08:00	
Closing Climate Security Gaps Requires More Reliable Data On Clim...	By Abeer S. Ahmad Among the limited progress made at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in November last year was an agreement to mobilize at least US$300 billion a year of finance for climate action in developing countries by 2035. This New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) trebles the $100 billion target for climate finance originally set at COP15 in 2009. The adequacy of the new goal aside—many campaigners and experts believe it falls far short of what is needed or fair—another important question is how to ensure that enough of the mobilized funds are used to benefit the people most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the $100 billion target was finally achieved in 2022 (although that is still hotly disputed). Nevertheless, several independent reports have found that too littleof the $100 billion went to benefit the most vulnerable, especially those in countries affected by fragility and conflict who are struggling to adapt to climate change. A recent SIPRI study revealed a range of issues in how climate finance is reported and analysed. It focused on reported commitments and disbursements of climate-related bilateral or multilateral official development assistance (ODA) between 2015 and 2021 in two of the OECD data sets most commonly used to track climate finance: the creditor reporting system and climate-related development financedata set. Addressing these issues could make it easier for donors and others to close gaps in climate finance and ensure that it is used effectively to help the most vulnerable. Current climate finance tracking The OECD is a key reference for climate finance data: at the request of donor countries, it has been reporting regular analyses on progress towards the $100 billion goal since 2015. It does this using an accounting framework that is aligned with the modalities for measuring climate finance agreed at COP24 in 2018. The OECD currently includes four types of climate finance in its regular assessment reports and databases: bilateral public funds (from public institutions and development banks); multilateral public funds (provided by multilateral development banks and multilateral climate funds, such as the Green Climate Fund and the Climate Investment Fund); climate-related export credits; and private finance mobilized by bilateral and multilateral public climate finance. The OECD databases use so-called Rio markers to identify the climate finance component of development finance flows; that is, those flows having climate mitigation or climate adaptation as a ‘principal’ or ‘significant’ objective. However, only bilateral donors who are part of the OECD Development Assistance Committee are obliged to use these markers in their reporting. The OECD system also includes a field for the country or region to which the finance was directed. Data gaps and pitfalls While headline figures may appear to provide a clear picture, assessing climate finance flows is complicated, and involves several methodological complexities. The SIPRI study identified multiple ways in which data choices can influence results, sometimes leading to a distorted picture. Some of these are discussed below. One of the key challenges in climate finance data is the gap between how much finance is promised and how much is actually disbursed. Most climate finance assessments are based on commitments rather than disbursements. However, the SIPRI assessment found that throughout the period 2015–21, disbursements of climate-related ODA were consistently around 40–50 per cent below the sums committed. Furthermore, data on disbursements was not always available and was often hard to link to earlier commitments. Another related challenge is how climate finance is identified. Multisectoral or ‘nexus’ programming—where climate action is integrated with peacebuilding, humanitarian, food security or other objectives—can be hard to assess. This is because it is not always clear how much of the finance provided to initiatives with diverse objectives went specifically to the climate-related objectives. This can often lead to large overestimates of climate finance. Destination unknown More important than headline figures is the question of whether climate finance—particularly finance for adaptation—is reaching the most vulnerable. The OECD found that of the $115.9 billion it claims was raised in 2022, around $80 billion went to middle-income countries and only $11 billion to low-income countries. Around $20 billion of the remaining finance could not be attributed to an income group. The SIPRI analysis found that donors had reported the destinations for around 20 per cent of climate finance commitments and 26 per cent of disbursements as simply ‘regional’ or ‘bilateral non-specific’, making it impossible to say where in the world they were directed. Since COP21 in 2015, there has been a political aspiration, as set out in Article 9 of the Paris Agreement, to achieve a balance in climate finance between mitigation and adaptation efforts, while prioritizing adaptation support for vulnerable countries. According to analysis by SIPRI researchers only around 32 per cent of the total disbursed climate ODA between 2015 and 2021 was allocated to adaptation. Our analysis also suggests that the most vulnerable have received a disproportionately small share of this adaptation finance, particularly if considered on a per capita basis. For example, Afghanistan, a highly climate-vulnerable and conflict-affected country, received only an average of $2.5 per capita per year in adaptation ODA in 2015–21. In contrast, Georgia, which is neither affected by conflict nor among the most vulnerable to climate change, received $20 per capita per year in the same period. Among countries receiving the least adaptation ODA per capita were the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Sudan, which received only $0.4 to $0.7 per capita per year on average, despite ranking among the 25 per cent most climate-vulnerable countries. Furthermore, much of the climate adaptation going to fragile and conflict-affected countries has been criticized as of poor quality. Statistics about how much finance goes to countries in different income categories can also be misleading, or at least questionable. This is because averages can mask huge variations and are highly dependent on which recipients are included or excluded in a given group—something that is not always made explicit. This issue is particularly marked when it comes to how much climate finance is directed to conflict-affected countries. Vulnerability to climate change impacts is often gravely exacerbated by the presence of fragility and armed conflict, while climate action can often work synergistically with peacebuilding. Thus, fragile and conflict-affected settings are logically among the most deserving recipients of climate finance. Despite this, conflict-affected countries consistently receive a much smaller share of climate finance than their more peaceful peers. In a stark example from SIPRI’s analysis, despite severe droughts and floods, Yemen received just $0.60 per capita in adaptation ODA between 2015 and 2021, compared to over $100 per capita in non-conflict-affected countries. However, there are no standardized criteria for which countries to include or how to categorize different levels of conflict when making such calculations, meaning that estimates can vary widely. The way these calculations account for differences in population size also matters, especially when comparing climate finance allocations on a per capita basis. Towards more equitable, transparent and responsible climate finance While gaps in reporting and analysis are not the primary reasons why more climate finance does not reach the most vulnerable populations, more comprehensive, reliable and transparent data and analysis are essential for efforts to make the distribution of climate finance more equitable. Donors have an important role to play by reporting climate finance thoroughly, consistently and accurately to reporting systems such as the OECD databases. However, the reporting systems themselves could also be improved, so that they gather the data needed to give an accurate picture of climate finance, including disbursements, how they are spent and where. In nexus programmes, it is crucial to more carefully distinguish and report the climate-specific component of the budget, even if the programmes have integrated goals. That way, data can be more transparent, which allows for more accurate tracking of climate finance while still accommodating the broader cross-sectoral nature of the programmes. The metrics used to analyse data also need an overhaul. The methodologies for generating statistics should be standardized and transparent. Calculations of per capita climate finance allocations can provide a more nuanced and transparent picture than per-country numbers, given the huge variation in population sizes. Reported statistics also need to take into account each recipient country’s vulnerability, conflict status and resources. Making such changes and acknowledging the many nuances can help to ensure that the increased flows of climate finance promised under the NCQG benefit the most vulnerable populations, making them more resilient and their futures more secure.

Napoleon: Then And Now – OpEd	As someone who sees Napoleon as one of history’s more prodigious and transformative figures (notice I didn’t say angelic or deeply moral), I was pleased to hear that Ridley Scott had recently directed a biopic on the man. As you would expect from a Ridley Scott movie, the war scenes are sumptuously reconstructed, as are the costumes and furniture in the indoor scenes. Joaquin Phoenix is his usual excellent self in his role as what we are led to believe was a deeply insecure Napoleon. But if you are hoping you might learn something about broader historical dynamics of the era when Napoleon stood astride the European world that just might help us better understand our current historical circumstance, this film is not terribly helpful. And that’s a shame, because there is much that our elites, and indeed all of us, could learn from the study of both the Corsican general’s hyper-charged march across Europe in the years between 1796 and 1815 as well as its considerable aftermath in the cultures of southern, central, and eastern Europe. Though today it generally gets lost amidst discussions of his stature and the effects it had on his psyche and/or his tempestuous relationship with his wife Josephine (see Ridley Scott’s Napoleon above) Napoleon arguably changed Europe more, and in more fundamental ways, than anyone else in modern history. To see him as a mere dictatorial marauder who sacked and stole from the many places he conquered and sent the booty back to the Louvre (something he definitely was and definitely did), is, in my view, to commit an enormous error of interpretation. Why? Because he was the first truly ideological (as opposed to religiously-inspired) marauder in history; that is, a person who sincerely sought to share the core democratic ideals of the French Revolution with the other peoples of Europe. And just as the Spaniards and the Portuguese imposed their program of Catholicism on the cultures of today’s Central and South America, Napoleon sought to impose the secular ideals of the French Revolution on the societies he conquered in his rampage across Europe. And they took at least a partial root in many places. It is, for example, impossible to speak about the sprouting of democratic ideals in Spain or Italy and many other places without taking into account the enormous, some would argue foundational, role of the Napoleonic invasions in these processes. The same could be said about the sprouting or rekindling of the idea of national sovereignty in places like Slovenia or Poland. And then there’s the emancipation of the Jews. In each country he entered, he freed Jews from their ghettos and abolished any remnants of the Inquisition while investing them with the same rights to liberty, fraternity, and equality that he theoretically granted to all others in the societies he came to dominate. Moreover, in those places where Catholicism had exercised a de facto monopoly on religious practice, he gave his sanction to long-suppressed attempts to promote Protestantism and Masonry. Wherever he went, he also left behind small but highly influential cells of in-country followers, usually from the educated classes, who viewed the pursuit of French-style 'universal' rights as their new guiding star, and the task of sharing these purportedly advanced ideas with their less educated countryman as both a right and a duty. But, of course, not everyone in these invaded cultures felt they needed improving with new, supposedly universal, ideas made in Paris. These probable populational majorities liked their own customs, their own languages, and their own culturally influenced ways of interpreting reality. And perhaps most of all, they did not appreciate that this 'help' from their French 'betters' and their native elite accomplices was being offered to them at the point of a bayonet. Indeed, who, other than people lacking self-esteem, would? And so they fought back. While Napoleon was largely able to subdue insurgents across the Germanic European center and the Italian peninsula, regions characterized by the existence of numerous small semi-independent polities, his attempts at domination eventually ran aground Spain and Russia, two large countries where, not coincidentally in my view, the cause of national unity had long been deeply entwined with institutionalized religious belief. If Rome was the beating heart of Catholicism, Spain had from the late 1400s onward been its well-armored bodyguard. Similarly Russia, with its concept of Moscow and the 'Third Rome,' viewed itself as the protector and would-be avenger of an orthodox Constantinople it saw as being unjustly sentenced to a life under Ottoman Muslim rule. Though Napoleon was finally stopped in Waterloo in 1815 and was sent off to the South Atlantic to die in exile, his influence on European affairs would, however, be felt for many years to come. This was the case most obviously in France where his son (Napoleon II), very briefly and basically in name only, and his nephew (Napoleon III) in a much more fundamental and substantial way, would follow him as leaders of the country. He had also ensured his figure and ideological outlook would not soon be forgotten by arranging a number of marriages between members of his extended family and important noble houses across the continent. But probably his most important legacy was the reaction it provoked among the educated classes, and eventually, the masses in the ostensibly (see below) German-speaking principalities that had most suffered under the onslaught of his Grande Armée. Thanks to the unfortunate late-19th and early 20th-century invention of Political Science—a discipline largely designed by Anglo-Saxon scholars near the centers of imperial power to wrest political events from their historical and cultural contexts in order to provide those same centers of power with hygienic-sounding rationales for their campaigns of pillage and terror—most mainstream analyses of movements of national identity today tend to center on the acts and maneuvers of recognizably 'political' actors. To approach the appearance and consolidation of nationalist movements through the often presentist frames developed by these esteemed 'scientists' is akin to analyzing the process of wine-making only from the point of bottling onward. To truly understand the appearance of the nationalist movements that emerged in central Europe, and subsequently to the continent’s eastern and southwestern sectors in the middle years of the 19th century, we must go back and study their cultural roots. And that means engaging with something that I suspect many Americans see as a mere subsection of the syllabus for a survey course in Western literature or Western art: Romanticism. Yes, Romanticism is a very identifiable form of making literature and art. But it did not emerge in a historical vacuum. Rather, it was derived from the sense among many central Europeans that, for all of its putative benefits, the French Revolution—rooted in schemes of Enlightenment reasoning that were said to be necessary and useful to all of the men and women of the world—had made their lives were less humanly rich than before. This sense of alienation was enhanced by the fact, mentioned above, that these supposedly universal values arrived at the doorstep of most people bearing universally frightening French muskets and cannons. The philosophers were among the first to react. They were followed by the artists, some of whom, like Goethe, had been wary of the hyper-rationality of the French-dominated Enlightenment well in advance of its martial instrumentalization by Napoleon. What bound the many creators from philosophy (e.g. Herder and Fichte) literature, history (e.g. the Brothers Grimm, Arndt and Von Kleist), pictorial art (Caspar David Friedrich), and music (Beethoven, Schumann, and Wagner) was their generalized exaltation of subjective feelings and the uniqueness of particular landscapes, indigenous linguistic codes, and local customs. In time, however, these intellectual and esthetic defenses of local, generally Germanic ways of living and seeing the world seeped down to the popular level. And on the Austrian side of the Germanic space, this meant that it was seeping down to people who were often not Germanic at all in language or culture. In other words, as the 19th century progressed, the Germanic reaction against French-inflected Enlightenment ideals, gave birth, in turn, to a set of revolts by various Slavic, Italian, and Magyar-speaking peoples against what they saw as the heavy-handedness of the German-speakers who dominated the Austrian Empire’s key centers of power. These uprisings culminated in the wave of revolutions in 1848 where, in another seeming paradox, those seeking greater indigenous power often melded their 'backward-looking' desire to recover and/or exalt their local languages and cultures to the 'forward-looking' democratic and statist ideals of the French Revolution that had so often offended Romantic activists in the generation previous to their own. Indeed, many have argued that it was precisely this seemingly antagonistic fusion of romantic and French republican influences that finally ensconced the nation-state as the normative model of social organization on the European continent. But that, my friends, is a story for another day. So why should we care about any of this today? Well, if there is anything that has become clear to alert minds over the last five years—and even more so since Elon Musk’s review of expenditures at USAID—it is that much of the world outside of our shores has been living under a modern, American-created equivalent of the Napoleonic invasions. While killing and mutilating still have a place within the toolbox of our merchants of supposedly universal values like trans-rights, childhood genital mutilation, pharmaceutical bondage, and unlimited abortion, it has been overtaken in precedence therein by color revolutions, vote-buying, and most of all, flood-the-zone style media bombardment. Like Napoleon’s troops, the legions of cognitive warriors from the myriad government-financed, non-governmental organizations (no contradiction there!) directed either overtly or covertly by strategic planners in Washington are sure they have arrived at the end of history when it comes to understanding what it means to live a free and dignified life. They have all the answers and it is therefore their duty to impose these wonderful ways of thinking—which as a visit to any major American city shows—have brought untold amounts of health and happiness to the US population—to the benighted masses of the world. And just to make sure that the natives understand the inevitability of adopting this Benevolence-Made-in-Washington(BMW), US planners have trained and placed into the highest levels of their governments, wholly owned US ciphers (e.g. Baerbock, Kallas, Sánchez, Habeck, Stoltenberg, Rutte, Macron, and a long etc.) able to explain the enormous benefits of the Pax Wokeana to the masses in their own vernaculars. And if those benighted souls fail to recognize the opportunities for cultural advancement being showered on them by their Besties by the Potomac (BBP)? Well, there’s an easy solution for that. You immediately and continuously blast a closed-loop psalmody containing the words 'Hitler,' 'Fascist,' and 'Right Wing Extremist' at them and their fellow countrymen. Twenty-four hours, never mind five full years, of such a bombardment truly works wonders on wobbly minds. Think of it as the psy-op correlate of Napoleon’s decision to institute the use of the enemy-disorienting quick-step among his troops. In Napoleon’s campaign to reorient the cultural goals and assumptions of his fellow Europeans, it all went very, very well. Until, of course, one day in Waterloo when it didn’t. Key to his waning inability to keep the momentum of conquest going was the stout resistance of the Russian people who, though serially portrayed by Westerners as backward and thus in need of constant tutelage, have shown a consistent resilience that few other peoples have ever shown in the face of foreign attacks. Am I saying that 2025 will be a repeat of 1815? No. But as Mark Twain reportedly said, while 'History does not repeat itself….it often rhymes.' In a few short years, the US oligarchy’s reality-creation machine has achieved impressive results. It has convinced important pluralities of people all across Europe and other parts of the world to believe all sorts of contrafactual things, ideas such as: men can breastfeed, humans are not a sexually dimorphic species, that great powers blow up pipelines that are essential to their economic well-being, that censoring speech, canceling elections, and outlawing parties are hallmarks of democracy, that injections that don’t stop transmission or infection are key to preserving the health of all, that wanting to simply regulate the flow of strangers into your country is inherently hateful. Yes, it has all worked pretty well for them up until now. But there are signs that the magic spell is wearing off among important parts of the affected populations. The drive among such disaffected people to finally stand up and object to the empire’s hocus-pocus has no doubt been strengthened by Russia’s decision to finally confront the high-minded and disorienting abstractions of the so-called West with forthright physical and spiritual strength. Though I could be wrong, it seems that we are entering a time when local and nationalist sentiments and symbols will, as occurred after 1815, be recovered and once again brought to the forefront of our social discourses. This rising embrace of provincial particularities will no doubt disturb many, especially those who, through their government-supported imposition of cosmopolitan cultural models, were well on their way to ridding the world of that 'troubling' thing called cultural memory. But for many, many more, I suspect, it will be lived—for a while at least—as a comforting return to the possibility of living in a state of psychic balance; that is, of once again practicing the erstwhile human art of melding identity-fortifying memories of the past with hopeful aspirations for the future.

Trump To Gaza: We Will Replace You – OpEd	They are coming to replace us.' It sounds like the tagline of a horror movie. And indeed, what the far right whispers into ears, chants at hate-filled rallies, and translates into odious legislation in white-majority countries is very much a horror movie in that it is both scary and untrue. In country after country, the far right has been promoting its horror movie premise that a horde of faceless immigrants is flooding across the border, aided by liberals, and displacing the native-born population. This campaign built around the Great Replacement conspiracy has mobilized White people of different socioeconomic backgrounds to amplify their pride, their power, and their privilege in the face of a vast, inchoate fear. Fear wins elections, unfortunately. But let’s be clear, the Great Replacement is one of the greatest hoaxes of recent memory, right up there with the notion that COVID vaccines kill people rather than save them. Immigrants, after all, are saving countries throughout the Global North, which otherwise would be not-so-slowly erasing themselves. The EU’s fertility rate, at 1.46 in 2022, is well below the replacement rate of 2.1. The U.S. rate, which dropped to 1.62 in 2023, is not substantially different. The Great Replacement, once whispered in the corners of bars and Internet chatrooms, is now being shouted in public places, as the far-right campaign has gone mainstream. Donald Trump is probably more responsible for this dismal state of affairs than anyone else. The once-and-again president hasn’t just translated the Great Replacement theory into domestic policy by closing the border with Mexico and deporting as many people as possible. He has weaponized the theory as part of U.S. foreign policy. It’s no longer a matter of stopping people from leaving 'shithole' countries to come to the United States. To the people of Gaza, Trump has proclaimed, 'We are coming to replace you.' Out of the Blue? Trump has long flirted with the Great Replacement theory. During the 2024 election, he asserted that Democrats were encouraging an inflow of the undocumented so that they could vote against Trump (they couldn’t, by law, so they didn’t). Before the 2016 election, Trump claimed that it would be the last U.S. election that Republicans had a chance of winning (for the same erroneous reason). Being wrong has never stopped Trump. He doubles down, which means he’s even wronger the next time around. Trump’s hostility toward Palestine and Palestinians is also nothing new. During his first term, charging 'chronic bias against Israel,' Trump withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council. He closed the PLO’s office in Washington, D.C. and deleted funding for UNRWA, the agency that supports Palestinian refugees. In a boon to the Israeli right, Trump broke a global convention by moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. All that time, he was trying to negotiate a megadeal to facilitate the diplomatic recognition of Israel by all major regional actors. As I wrote in 2020, Where does this leave Palestinians? Up a creek without a state. The Trump administration has used its much-vaunted 'deal of the century' to make any future deal well-nigh impossible. In collaboration with Netanyahu, Trump has strangled the two-state solution in favor of a single Israeli state with a permanent Palestinian underclass. But what Trump is proposing now with respect to Gaza is hubris beyond anything he has ever publicly considered. The president has proposed to expel all 2 million citizens of Gaza to nearby countries, none of which has even the slightest interest in accepting them. The Gazans would have no right of refusal and no right of return. Trump has threatened both Jordan and Egypt with economic penalties if they don’t welcome the expelled. Given domestic considerations, neither country is likely to bow to that kind of pressure. Imperialism Repackaged The United States was late to the nineteenth-century game of colonialism. Even though there wasn’t as much land to grab by the 1890s, the United States jumped right in: Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Panama Canal. Donald Trump must feel as if the United States is late to the game this time around, too. Russia has grabbed a chunk of Ukraine. Israel is reasserting control over Gaza. Turkey sliced off a piece of Syria. China effectively absorbed Hong Kong. Nothing betokens a healthy empire like a steady diet of territory. Thus, Trump has talked of reasserting control over the Panama Canal. He is eyeing the vastness of Greenland like Secretary of State William Seward once coveted Alaska. Even good neighbor Canada isn’t excluded from Trump’s greedy gaze. Like most fabulizing colonialists, Trump has promised the Gazans that 'We’ll build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people. We’ll build beautiful communities, safe communities — could be five, six, could be two, but we’ll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is.' The Gazans know that this is nonsense. Overcrowded refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon have existed for over 70 years, and no one has managed to turn those into 'beautiful' or 'safe' communities. Like a slumlord eager to get rid of tenants so that he can raze the property and build a new skyscraper, Trump doesn’t care about the current inhabitants. The focus instead is on building an oligarchs’ retreat that’s a short flight from Israeli, Gulf, and Egyptian elites. The Great Replacement is a clear case of psychological projection, like an inveterate liar who is always calling his opponents liars or a serial rapist who constantly complains about rapists coming from over the border. 'They' are not the problem; we the wealthy countries are the problem. Waves of immigrants are escaping wars that rich countries supported or economic conditions that rich nations helped to create through neoliberal reforms or climate conditions that rich industrialized powers have largely produced and subsequently ignored. All these conditions have converged to push Gazans off the land. Yet, despite this adversity, they want to stay on their land and achieve some measure of political sovereignty. Finally, there’s a people who want to stay, and now Trump wants them to go. The irony would be laughable—if it weren’t a war crime.

The Intricate Connection Of Birdsongs To Human Language – Analysi...	Listening to birds benefits our mental health, leading to less stress and paranoia. Birdsongs have inspired poets and lovers, becoming one of the philosophical focal points in ancient Greece and Rome. They have also led to several long-ago debates about the relationship between birdsong and human language. 'A robust body of evidence accrued over approximately 100 years demonstrates striking analogies between birdsong and speech, both learned forms of vocalization,' states the Royal Society journal. Some thinkers have argued that humans are the only rational animals since they have a language, unlike nonhuman animals. Yet bird communications through melodious songs sound very much like a language, casting doubts on these views. No nonhuman animals other than birds, specifically songbirds, display such fine musical articulation and use these communication skills among their species. 'Humans and songbirds share the key trait of vocal learning, manifested in speech and song, respectively. Striking analogies between these behaviors include that both are acquired during developmental critical periods when the brain's ability for vocal learning peaks,' adds the Royal Society article. The Philosophical View on Songbirds Aristotle, a philosopher and scientist educated at Plato's Academy, first systematically studied birds and all other known living creatures. In addition to his other works, he wrote the monumental History of Animals (the original title in Greek was the more modest Inquiries on Animals). It remained the authoritative source for Western zoology until the 16th century. Aristotle asked the questions of what and why. He already knew, ages ago, that birds learn their songs. In History of Animals, he states: 'Of little birds, some sing a different note from the parent birds, if they have been removed from the nest and have heard other birds singing; and a mother-nightingale has been observed to give lessons in singing to a young bird, from which spectacle we might obviously infer that the song of the bird was not equally congenital with mere voice, but was something capable of modification and of improvement.' In particular, parrots may be able to closely mimic the human voice due to the use of their tongue. According to popular opinion, in ancient Greece, parrots didn't produce melodies but had a semi-human voice and could learn Greek. Aristotle didn't buy it. According to him, only humans had logos[reason] and the ability to use language to communicate. What parrots did was simply mimicry. Fast-forward to the poignant story of 'Humboldt's talking parrot.' In 1799, during his explorations along the Orinoco River, German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt 'stayed with a local Indigenous Carib tribe near the isolated village of Maypures,' located deep in the Venezuelan jungle. The Indigenous inhabitants kept tame parrots in cages and taught them how to speak. But among them was one bird that 'sounded unusual.' When Humboldt asked why, he learned that the parrot had belonged to a nearby enemy tribe who were driven from their home village and land. The few surviving members fled to a tiny islet perched between the river rapids. It was there where their culture and their lingo endured for a few more years until the last tribesman died. The only creature 'who spoke their language' was the talking parrot. Fortunately, Humboldt transcribed the parrot's vocabulary phonetically in his journal. This helped rescue a portion of the vanished tribe's language from extinction. Today, some linguists accept this story as a metaphor for the vulnerability of languages, with one lost every 40 days. Still, skeptics wonder if the tale is accurate. Whatever the case may be, Humboldt himself reports in the second volume of his Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the Year 1799-1804, published soon after his return to Europe, about his stay with a group of natives in an isolated village beside a waterfall on the Orinoco River: 'A tradition circulates among the Guahibos, that the warlike Atures [another tribe], pursued by the Caribs, escaped to the rocks that rise in the middle of the Great Cataracts; and there that nation, heretofore so numerous, became gradually extinct, as well as its language.' This animal-supporting mindset has stood against the rise of Christianity, which held that all other beings were created to serve humans and their needs. Consequently, the Church favored the side that regarded animals as irrational. Therefore, Aristotle governed supreme in religious teachings, philosophy, and scholastic learning within universities until the arrival of the 16th century. Despite the belief that animals were inferior to humans, people had their own ways. Songbirds were widely liked and were memorialized thanks to the great poets of the Middle Ages. Both the French Provencal troubadours and the German and Austrian Minnesingers cherished singing birds and, above all, nightingales. These are a few lines from Walter von der Vogelweide, who used a last name that means 'of the bird meadow:' 'Besides the forest in the valeTándaradéi,Sweetly sang the nightingale.' According to legend, the poet left a will requesting that the birds at his tomb be fed daily. The Language of Animals In the second half of the 18th century, the philosophical focus shifted from the age-old argument that nonhuman animals lacked reason to a serious study of animal language. German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder's 1772 Treatise on the Origin of Language asserts that 'these groans, these sounds, are language' through which the animals communicate. Even if nonhuman animals are not rational, they have, for example, the language of pain. For human and nonhuman beings, 'there is a language...which is an immediate law of nature,' Herder adds. Hein van den Berg, an assistant professor from the University of Amsterdam, published an excellent paper on these developments in 2022. He writes, 'Herder affirmed that each animal species has a distinctive language.' And that especially includes songbirds. In addition, Herder endorsed sympathy and empathy as qualities that may enable interspecies communications. Humans don't understand what animals say, and animals do not comprehend human concepts and speech. But this can be surmounted by Einfühlung, slipping into the nonhuman being's skin to understand how it feels. It is like 'walking in someone's shoes.' It is a word Herder invented. Perhaps birdsong is so beloved by humans because it enables this feeling to resonate instantly and naturally. A person usually reacts to a singing bird with spontaneous and joyful emotions. Interestingly, Herder's work on empathy almost certainly provides the foundation for the Seattle Aquarium's empathy-themed programs. The aquarium fosters empathy for wildlife, develops teacher resources, offers empathy fellowships, operates an empathy café, conducts empathy workshops in Seattle and around the country, and holds biennial conferences. Arthur Schopenhauer, frequently dubbed the philosopher of artists and pessimists, was one of the earliest supporters of animal rights. He was blunt about his views in his book The Basis of Morality: 'The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.' Hindu philosophies and Buddhism greatly influenced Schopenhauer, who respected and supported animals. He was also prescient, anticipating current conditions by writing, 'The world is not a factory, and animals are not products for our use.' While philosophers have emphasized birds and their songs, what did scientists, researchers, ornithologists, and regular bird lovers learn about birds' origins? Evolution of Birds: The Scientific Perspective Amazingly, our beautiful birds started as not-so-handsome dinosaurs. The evidence shows that they emerged from theropod dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic period, some 150 million years ago. The Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin displays the most complete specimen of Archaeopteryx, regarded for more than a century as the oldest bird fossil from the transitional phase of evolution from dinosaur to bird. Resembling a raven, the fossil was unearthed in 1860. An additional 12 fossils, most with imprints of feathers, were discovered afterward. All of them came from the Solnhofen Limestone formation in Bavaria, Germany. In recent decades, however, a few different small and feathered dinosaurs were excavated in other locations. These may, likewise, have a role in the story of the evolution of birds. Songbirds are a suborder of birds, specifically of perching birds called passerines or oscines. There are more than 4,000 species, all of which have a unique vocal organ: the syrinx. The songbirds can execute various tasks and performances with their vocal organs. They use short, practical calls to communicate details about food or predators and long, learned, and practiced songs to find and seduce mates, defend territories, compete, and develop social bonds. Perhaps even more fascinating is that they all do it in their own way. For example, the males of the highly social Australian zebra finches do not sing to defend territory and do not perform to impress potential mates. They wait until they find their love partner and then serenade her, often daily and for years to come. Songbirds are actively involved in learning, listening to, and practicing the complex creations we call songs. Birds of the same species use different dialects in various locations. Peter Marler, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Davis, did groundbreaking work on how birds talk. He told the Sacramento Bee in 1997 that '[d]ialects [in birds] are so well marked that if you really know your white-crowned sparrows, you'll know where you are in California.' Once Marler's student, Fernando Nottebohm was already fascinated by birds as a boy growing up in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is Dorothea L. Leonhardt, a professor emeritus at The Rockefeller University. Nottebohm 'discovered that adult canaries regenerate neurons from neural stem cells. ... [and believes] doctors may one day be able to replace neurons in the human brain to offset the effects of disease, injury, or aging,' according to the Franklin Institute. Scientists have also ascertained that songbirds hear their melodies differentlythan humans. People have dissimilar hearing capabilities and can't discern the nuances and subtleties vital to birds. Many composers have used bird sounds, including Vivaldi in 'The Four Seasons,' Handel in the aria 'Sweet Bird' in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, Beethoven in his 'Symphony No. 3,' and in 'Symphony No. 6,' in which you can hear a nightingale (played by the flute), a quail (oboe) and a cuckoo (clarinet). Nightingales can be heard in the compositions of Mendelssohn, Liszt, Grieg, Ravel, and various others. Birds have, in fact, influenced our musical creativity since the times of the hunter-gatherers. 'Birdsong has inspired musicians from Bob Marley to Mozart and perhaps as far back as the first hunter-gatherers who banged out a beat. And a growing body of research shows that human musicians' affinity toward birdsong has a strong scientific basis,' states a 2023 New York Times article. Birds have the habit of practicing their singing daily. Songbirds 'require daily vocal exercise to first gain and subsequently maintain peak vocal muscle performance,' according to a December 2023 Nature article. But that's not all. Not only has the field of birdsong biology experienced rapid growth, but studies about vocal learning, neurobiological aspects, and theory of mind insights have expanded our knowledge. A 2020 article titled 'Birds are Philosophy Professors' credits the capacity for flight and highlights the skill of gliding when birds are confronted by adverse conditions. 'When faced with torrential wind, they fully acknowledge nature's forces are stronger, and the best way to deal with it is to simply be in it. ... Birds stop flapping their wings and they simply glide. This awareness is crucial because they would otherwise spend energy flapping that wouldn't amount to any progress,' points out the article. A quote by the Stoic Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius stresses the wisdom of such behavior: 'The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.' Birds act accordingly. Resistance to the stronger forces of nature would waste energy, so they wait, gliding, until things improve. Surprisingly, birds also can remember humans. The evidence for this is clear. For instance, species like robins, mockingbirds, and pigeons have 'some of the most well-documented cases of facial recognition,' states Chirp Nature Center. Pigeons even react to facial expressions. Be kind, and they will recall. Chase them away, and they will not forget. Moreover, birds certainly remember dependable food and water sources and show up daily; suddenly, there they are, just stopping by to eat and drink. How Birdsongs Help Humans But these beneficial factors are a two-way street. Humans also gain great psychological value from their interaction with songbirds. An article in Wild Bird Feeding Institute reports on a recent study by Emil Stobbe of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin that explores the mental health benefits of soothing bird melodies. Among them are stress reduction, mood enhancement, and connection to nature. '[F]or the first time, beneficial, medium-sized effects of birdsong soundscapes were demonstrated, reducing paranoia,' the study states. Soldiers in the trenches of World War I knew this already. The poem 'Dead Man's Dump' gives voice to their feelings, stating that while 'the air [was]... loud with death,' the soldiers gained resilience and kept their sanity by listening to the song of birds, counterbalancing the noisy chaos of war. Michael Guida wrote a lovely, powerful book called Listening to BritishNature. 'According to one analysis, living in an area with 10 percent higher avian diversity rates increases life satisfaction 1.53 times more than a higher salary,' points out the Conservation magazine. Another small book, A Short Philosophy of Birds—written by French ornithologist Philippe J. Dubois and Elise Rousseau, philosopher and author of several works on nature and animals—is a delightful gem overflowing with stories and details about birds and human life. The book also highlights the mortal danger birds are in. We don't see this since it happens discreetly, but since 1970, a staggering 2.9 billion breeding adult birds have vanished across North America as of 2020. The book reflects on the threat humans pose to the existence of birds: 'Birds hide away to die, so they say. And it's true. Have you ever seen a dead swallow, except for one... hit by a car or flown into a pane of glass?' Meanwhile, the philosophical association between birdsong and human language is still as relevant as in antiquity. A 2013 linguistic study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a 2014 genetic study at Duke University found that early humans may have acquired language by imitating birdsong and that identical genes are activated when learning to sing (birds) or talk (humans). 'If early humans developed their own language by imitating birdsong, it's nothing short of incredible that this linguistic history was expressed in creation myths several hundred thousand years after the fact, from Africa to Kansas,' states a 2023 Patheos article. The Hopi Tribe, a sovereign nation located in northeastern Arizona, emerged from the underworld with the help of a singing mockingbird who gave them the gift of language. According to the Osage of Kansas, 'their ancestral souls were once without bodies until a redbird volunteered itself to make human children by transforming its wings into arms, its beak into a nose and by passing on the gift of language.' Birds are similarly key players in various creation myths worldwide. The profound connection between birdsong and human language continues to captivate scientists, philosophers, and artists alike. From Aristotle's early observations to modern linguistic and neurological studies, the parallels between avian and human communication remain striking. Birds not only inspire poetry and music but also challenge long-held beliefs about the exclusivity of human language and cognition. Their songs offer a sense of wonder, a bridge between species, and even psychological benefits to those who listen. As we learn more about songbirds' intelligence and emotional depth, we are reminded of our shared evolutionary past and the importance of preserving these creatures and their habitats. Whether through scientific research, philosophical inquiry, or personal appreciation, birdsongs continue to enrich human understanding of language, empathy, and the natural world.

The Common Law Of Antitrust – OpEd	The Sherman Act (1890) declares 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations' (15 U.S.C. §1; emphasis added) to be illegal. The statute’s adoption of 'restraint of trade' language has misled some commentators—even brilliant ones like the late Harold Demsetz—into thinking that the Sherman Act merely codified the common law’s hostility to monopoly and other business practices that might interfere with the operations of free and open competitive markets. However, that interpretation of the purposes and effects of Senator Sherman’s law and later antitrust statutes (like the Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts of 1914) overlooks the fundamental fact that disputes between identifiable private parties would no longer be resolved exclusively in common law courts. The new federal statutes authorized the Department of Justice and, subsequently, the Federal Trade Commission (under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which proscribes 'unfair methods of competition') to initiate and litigate charges against private companies they accused of unlawfully restraining trade. The Sherman Act and its legislative successors established a centralized and asymmetrically powerful framework for antitrust law enforcement. The consequences of that shift should be appreciated more widely and addressed. A Legal Sea Change It is one thing for a defendant firm to face accusations of restraining trade from a private party; it is an entirely different matter to deal with the same charge brought by a taxpayer-funded government agency. The 'deep pockets' of public-sector plaintiffs and their weak incentives to control case-related expenses enable the DOJ and the FTC to initiate more antitrust lawsuits and to pursue them longer than benefit-cost considerations would normally justify. Nevertheless, those two federal agencies file significantly fewer cases yearly than private antitrust plaintiffs. The Sherman and Clayton Acts also allow private parties to enforce their provisions, motivated undoubtedly by the statutory prospect of recovering treble damages from a guilty defendant. However, nearly all (70 to 90 percent) of private antitrust lawsuits are settled out of court, indicating that one or both litigants frequently conclude that, owing to the expense and the opportunity cost of executives’ time, pursuing the matter to a final resolution is not worth the effort. Moreover, section 2 of Senator Sherman’s law declares a private firm’s efforts, either on its own or in combination with other companies, to acquire or maintain a commercial monopoly to be a felony. If found guilty, as of June 2004’s statutory amendments, the guilty defendant(s) can be fined (up to $100,000,000), their executives can be sentenced to prison (up to 10 years), or both. Those penalties differ substantively from the common law’s (civil, not criminal) remedies for restraints of trade, which typically are confined to issuing injunctions to 'cease and desist' illegal activities and/or ordering defendants to pay fines meant to compensate plaintiffs for economic injuries sustained. When a government agency is the plaintiff, any fines collected are deposited into the public treasury rather than paid to the injured party. Before King Henry II recognized that public law enforcement could reliably generate revenue for the Crown, restitution was the only remedy available under common law for victims of all crimes, including theft and murder. Once formal police forces and public prosecutors had been established, private citizens were relieved of responsibility for apprehending, detaining, and prosecuting individuals accused of injuring their persons or property. After such harm became a crime against the state, victims can obtain compensation only by successfully suing the perpetrator in civil court after a criminal judgment has been rendered. What Was Lost Common-law courts had dealt with allegations of unlawful restraints of trade for centuries before the US Congress enacted the planet’s first federal antitrust law in 1890. Over time, the courts developed standards, on a case-by-case basis, to determine whether a particular restraint was reasonable and, hence, enforceable or unreasonable and therefore unlawful. Once a dispute is heard and a decision is rendered in favor of one litigant, the ruling can be appealed to a higher court by the losing party and ultimately to a (supreme) court of last resort. Along with the ancient right to trial by jury and the availability of multiple venues wherein disputes can be litigated, appeals processes help reduce lower court errors. Many law and economics scholars draw parallels between the common law’s institutions and competitive market processes. Over time, some judicial rulings become accepted as precedents that guide court decisions in later cases involving similar facts. Precedents help establish clear and stable expectations about the consequences of individual behavior. Predictability (stare decisis) is a hallmark of the common law, as understood by Bruno Leoni and Frederick Hayek, among others. Classical liberals distinguish sharply between the behavioral rules evolving from the norms and customary practices of ordinary human beings and the top-down rules imposed on them by legislation. A well-known legal trope is that the common law is 'judge-made.' That reading of the operations of the complex institution that emerged in England around the mid-fifth century is too simple. The alternative interpretation, traceable to William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England, first published in 1765, is that the job of a common-law judge is not to make the law but to find it in the rules adopted by the community in which the litigants find themselves. Although some legal scholars question judges’ capacities to discover and apply frequently unwritten behavioral norms and customary practices to the matters before them, it has been done. Ghen v. Rich, 8 F. 159 (1881), one of the first cases students encounter in courses on the law of property, involved a dispute over the ownership of a whale ('fugitive property,' as it is called). The crew of a vessel owned by Ghen harpooned a whale off the coast of Massachusetts that sank and days later washed up on a nearby beach. Ellis stumbled upon the whale’s carcass and sold it at auction to a local processing plant owned by Rich. In awarding ownership of the whale to Ghen and ordering Rich to pay damages to him for unlawful conversion, the court relied on the 'first-iron' rule adopted by whalers plying the North Atlantic Ocean. (See Robert Ellickson for discussion of whaling industry norms in other corners of the globe.) The North Atlantic’s whalers customarily assigned ownership priority to the ship pursuing a whale that first fixed a harpoon (in fact, a 'bomb lance' here) to it. That practice incentivized efforts to locate and capture whales prized at the time for their oil and ambergris. Neither Ellis nor Rich had contributed to that effort. Statutory law tends to be less flexible and, thus, less likely than common law to promote economic efficiency. Common-law courts do err, but the parties before the bar remain free to contract around mistaken court rulings. Erroneous judicial decisions establish a reversion point from which the parties can begin negotiations to achieve better, more efficient, mutually agreeable outcomes. Such bargaining is generally precluded when decisions are handed down by legislators or the agents of the administrative state. Everyone within the reach of a statute or regulation must comply or face sanctions for not doing so. While some exceptions may be statutorily or administratively granted, paying less than a mandated minimum wage or charging more than a controlled maximum rent is prohibited. Common law processes are imperfect. Error rates are high, uncertainty concerning litigation outcomes often obliges both parties to spend heavily on lawyers and expert witnesses, and juries may be swayed more by the comparative courtroom demeanors and performances of the parties’ legal advocates than by the facts presented. 'The Play’s the Thing' in adversarial common-law trials, according to Gordon Tullock. While all of that may be so, public choice theory helps explain why replacing traditional common law procedures with public enforcement of statutory proscriptions against monopoly should not be celebrated. Antitrust Law Enforcement in Public-Choice Perspective Blind faith in the rule of experts motivated civil service reforms under the first progressive US presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. Both naively thought that the incompetence and corruption obvious under the prevailing 'spoils system' would be minimized by staffing the executive branch’s administrative departments with qualified professionals, who thenceforth would reliably implement Congress’s legislative instructions without fear or favor. Public choice ('politics without romance,' in James Buchanan’s words) emphasizes behavioral symmetry and adds a dose of reality to comprehending bureaucratic behavior. Economists and other social scientists cannot logically adopt two different models to explain human action: one for ordinary markets (self-interest, broadly construed) and another for non-market settings like government ('public interest'). If one seeks to understand why outcomes in the private sector differ from those in the public sector, the analytical focus must be on institutions (incentives and constraints) rather than the motivations of the relevant actors in the two settings. Law enforcement agencies are no exception. For more than a century, scholars studying the origins and consequences of antitrust legislation—both at home and abroad—have been harshly critical of its application in many specific cases. If one assumes that the Justice Department, the FTC, states’ attorneys general, whose antitrust authority arises under 'little' Sherman and FTC acts, and the European Commission all seek to serve the public’s interest by safeguarding competitive market conditions, then those mistakes can be explained only by bureaucratic error or ignorance. Such explanations amount to unscientific handwringing. Public choice reasoning began to be applied to antitrust law enforcement only in the 1970s and, more seriously, in the 1980s and beyond. (Shughart and McChesney 2010and Shughart 2022 offer recent literature summaries.) One lesson of that literature is that the parochial incentives of bureaucrats and the political pressures exerted on the agencies by parties with important stakes in antitrust law enforcement outcomes shape decisions at every step in the process, from launching a formal investigation into alleged anticompetitive behavior to filing and litigating a complaint against a defendant company, and on to devising an effective remedy for business acts or practices determined to be unlawful. The lawyers and economists employed by the antitrust bureaus are too distant from the marketplace to comprehend the current state of competition or predict its future evolution with or without intervention. Demanding the production of truckloads of company documents and deposing their executives do not overcome bureaucrats’ lack of Hayekian knowledge of the 'peculiar circumstances of time and place' underpinning actual business decisions. The recent reinvigoration of antitrust law enforcement, especially in high-technology industries, has not improved on the historical record. Past mistakes, such as drawing the boundaries of the markets relevant for assessing competitive conditions too narrowly, continue apace. (See here, here, here, and here.) After the American Bar Association published a report harshly critical of the Federal Trade Commission in 1969, Judge Richard Posner recommended repealing the FTC Act and abolishing the Commission altogether. He later changed his mind. More recently, a former FTC General Counsel proposed folding the Commission’s antitrust authority into the Department of Justice. Because the DOJ’s antitrust law enforcement record is as checkered as that of the FTC (see the literature linked to in the previous paragraph), such reforms are unlikely to lessen the antitrust bureaus’ obvious problems. Eliminating the public sector’s authority to enforce purposely vague competition statutes and relying fully on the common law’s centuries of experience in adjudicating claims that trade has been restrained would be more consistent with the norms of liberty and freedom of contract. Justice Thurgood Marshall characterized the Sherman Act as 'the Magna Carta of free enterprise' in United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596 (1972). However, it has proven to be no such thing. Like other forms of public regulation, the statute has not promoted competition and protected consumers. Rather, it has been a tool wielded by bureaucrats and self-serving competitors seeking to win in the courtroom what they’ve failed to win in the marketplace.

Government Can Be Downsized Without Destroying The Constitution –...	Even a somewhat informed observer might wonder why President Donald Trump and the Republicans, who control all three branches of government and both houses of Congress, would need to rely on executive orders of questionable legality and constitutionality to finally accomplish the laudable goal of reducing the size of government as a percentage of GDP—which they have been rhetorically championing for decades but never seem to achieve. For example, abolishing the Department of Education, which Republicans have long advocated, and at least trimming back the U.S. Agency for International Development need to be effectuated. However, in a republic, ends do not justify the means; following constitutional processes is paramount and should be easy given Republican control of all branches of government. Thus, that observer could and should conclude that the Trump administration is using questionable executive orders to realize these objectives, because its main goal, as was George W. Bush administration’s previously, is to dramatically expand executive power. The most dramatic attempt to tip the balance of power among the branches of government is the Trump administration’s attempt to freeze government grants and contracts to make sure they complied with President Trump’s priorities. Constitutionally, President Trump’s priorities flatly don’t matter. These are grants and contracts that have already been approved by Congress and signed by the previous president. If the president has allowed Elon Musk and his staff to penetrate the U.S. Treasury’s payment system to stop payments to programs, grants, and contracts that Trump disfavors, he is attempting, by another means, the equivalent of a line-item veto of certain spending. The Supreme Court previously ruled such a veto unconstitutional; the president is allowed only to veto a congressionally passed bill in its entirety, the good with the bad, and President Joe Biden did not do so. Another possible ploy that the Trump administration has talked about using, similar to the prohibited line-item veto, has also been negated by the Budget Control and Anti-Impoundments Act of 1974, which nixed executive impoundment of funds when the president doesn’t feel like executing and enforcing congressional spending laws. The administration argues that this law is unconstitutional, but the Constitution clearly asserts that one of the president’s main responsibilities is to faithfully execute the laws—meaning whether he likes it or not. Moreover, one of Congress’ major powers is that of the purse—that is, to fund federal programs. If the president is allowed to usurp this power through a line-item veto, fund impoundment, a payment freeze, or selective payment, why have Congress in the first place? And of course, instead of unconstitutionally freezing spending or deleting payment for items that have already been appropriated by Congress for this fiscal year, Trump could just wait to cut the next fiscal year’s budget, which is being formulated now and takes effect in October. However, many analysts believe the administration is deliberately using illegal or unconstitutional means to achieve its goals in order to generate court cases that will expand executive power past the imperial presidency that already exists. The administration likely knows that it will lose some cases but might get to expand its powers in some areas because many of the Republican justices on the Supreme Court believe in the unitary of the executive. This theory of a powerful presidency on steroids believes that the president has unitary control over the executive branch and can do pretty much what he pleases with it, the Congress and the judiciary be damned. One of the most extreme proponents of the theory is Vice President J. D. Vance, who has argued many times that the president should ignore court rulings that infringe on his rightful executive powers. He recently declared that 'judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.' Yet, if the administration ignores judicial rulings, it will trigger a constitutional crisis of immense proportions. Since 1803, the Supreme Court has adjudicated whether congressional legislation and executive behavior comport with the Constitution. The court has not always been right, but it generally has been obeyed. The Trump administration is trying to steamroll both the judiciary and Congress using the unitary executive theory. Yet the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, with King George III in mind, were leery of unlimited executive power and thus gave the most enumerated powers to Congress, assigning the legislative body powers that the king traditionally possessed (declaration of war) or making the executive share them with Congress (treaty-making power and power to appoint executive officials). In addition, from the George Washington administration until the 1920s, each executive department or agency, which the Congress created, negotiated its budget directly with the appropriate congressional committees—with the White House having little involvement. In fact, the congressional power of the purse was so revered that law governing the U.S. Treasury required the department to report to Congress and the president. Thus, President Washington generally refrained from intrusive management of Treasury’s affairs. In conclusion, the Founders intended that the executive and the judiciary were to serve as checks on a dominant Congress. The president was to merely execute the laws passed by Congress, and many thought that the judiciary was to keep the two other branches within constitutional bounds. The unitary executive theory is an ahistorical latter-day invention, often resembling the theory of the 'living Constitution' espoused by the left. Thus, the Trump administration is currently pushing U.S. constitutional checks and balances to the breaking point by trying to further usurp Congress and threaten the judiciary.

European Business Nuclear Alliance Launched	A group of 14 European business federations have published a joint declaration announcing their joint commitment to strengthening the European nuclear industry. The declaration highlights four priority areas. Composed of 14 signatory federations, with 19 nationalities represented, the alliance is 'a mobilisation of economic actors to defend the place of nuclear energy within the European Union and make Europe a decarbonised, competitive and sovereign economic power', said France's Medef, which initiated the alliance. Its other members include: Belgium's VOB FEB, the Bulgarian Industrial Association, Croatia's HUP, the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic, Danish Industry, Confederation of Finnish Industries, Confederation of Hungarian Employers and Industrialists, Italy's Confindustria, Polish Confederation Lewiatan, Romania's Concordia, Slovakia's National Union of Employers, and Confederation of Swedish Enterprise. The Confederation of British Industry is also a member, although its listing says its signature is 'relevant for all non-EU related topics'. 'With the global race to develop clean technologies intensifying, Europe must deepen and expand its investments in strategic value chains to cement its position as a climate leader and defend its economic potential,' the declarationsays. 'A diverse set of solutions and technologies are needed in the face of intensifying decarbonisation demands and competitiveness pressures. 'Nuclear energy is one of these critical levers, complementing renewable energy and other clean solutions and ensuring businesses have access to a competitive, stable, and predictable supply of decarbonised energy. Scaling up investment, driving innovation in advanced technologies and strengthening the circular economy offer a strategic opportunity to consolidate the nuclear value chain alongside other key clean industrial sectors, fostering competitiveness and resilience at the European level.' The declaration says the signatories 'welcome the new momentum for nuclear energy that is emerging at European level, including the recognition of the role of nuclear energy at EU level in the Net Zero Industry Act, 2040 Climate objective Communication, as well as the launch of the SMR Industrial Alliance'. However, they say, 'it is time for Europe to build on these breakthroughs and go further'. The alliance has identified four focus areas, which it says are in alignment with the development of the Clean Industrial Deal and in anticipation of the next milestones for meeting European economic and climate objectives. These are: providing a clear and supportive institutional framework, removing barriers and fully implementing technology neutrality; securing access to private and public funding; accelerating the industrialisation of the sector and fostering a robust nuclear ecosystem in Europe; and supporting the development and renewal of skills. 'Nuclear energy cannot remain on the sidelines of European strategies,' the declaration says. 'On the path to a decarbonised economy and energy system, all technologies that result in the reduction of emissions must be deployed. It is now urgent to set up the framework and the concrete actions for a transition that fully leverages the complementarity between nuclear, renewable energies and other low-carbon technologies.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf6GdkYTqVAZ1	2025-02-12T17:18:17-08:00	
Why They Really Hate Elon Musk – OpEd	By Connor O'Keeffe As Elon Musk continues to take over and wind down parts of the federal bureaucracy, establishment figures from across media and politics are growing increasingly resentful of the tech entrepreneur. If you read a national newspaper, turn on a major news channel, or tune into one of the establishment’s many late-night 'satire' shows, you’re bound to see Musk getting mocked and criticized relentlessly. He’s framed as a rich person using government to get even richer and as a political operative willing to skirt rules and norms to get what he wants. Many establishment types also like to remind their audience Musk is 'unelected' at any chance they get—a not-so-subtle suggestion that the actions he’s taking in DC right now are illegitimate. You’ll also hear Musk and his team criticized for conducting some of their work in secret. And then there’s, of course, the swipe that’s become popular in the wake of his gutting of USAID: that he is willing to hurt poor people to make himself better off. Setting aside the many flaws and inaccuracies with these characterizations of Elon Musk, it’s worth noting that all of them apply even more accurately to the American political establishment itself. To start, 'rich people using the government to benefit themselves' has defined the American political system for more than a century. As Murray Rothbard laid out in great detail in his book The Progressive Era, the transition from the laissez-faire, hyper-limited government system of the mid-1800s was not driven by the bottom-up plea to protect workers and keep food clean that we were taught about in elementary school. It grew out of the recognition among the heads of industry that they could much more effectively protect their market share from smaller competitors and go on to expand it if they used the power of government for their own benefit. In other words, the key to staying on top switched from innovating to lobbying. That started with railroad companies in the late 1800s but quickly grew to include industrial farmers, healthcare providers, and bankers in the early 1900s, followed by weapons companies, Wall Street firms, and many others in the second half of the century. Today, virtually all the giant corporations that dominate these industries owe their positions to government policies set up in their favor—to the detriment of the American public. The modern political establishment is defined by their willingness and ability to protect and expand this dynamic. It is laughable to hear them falsely criticize Musk for doing the same thing. The same goes for his supposed violation of constitutional rules and norms. Many of the loudest establishment voices condemning this behavior were cheering just as loudly as the George Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama administrations launched dozens of undeclared wars, conducted warrantless surveillance, used torture, carried out extrajudicial assassinations on American citizens, and provided aid and comfort to Al Qaeda. At the very least, these are explicit violations of Article 1, Section 8; Article 3, Section 3; and the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, as well as Section 2340A of Title 18 of the United States Code. And during the covid pandemic, the political establishment took the exact same kind of approach they’re now criticizing Musk for conducting. Federal and state governments rushed to close businesses, schools, and churches and prohibit people from attending public gatherings—all without even pretending to care about the constitutional rules and norms they’re now feigning concern about. Next, the implication that what Musk is doing is illegitimate because he’s unelected is ridiculous. Not only was it made very clear to voters before the election that Musk would do this if Trump won, virtually the entire federal workforce that the establishment is trying to protect from Musk is unelected too. The millions of unelected officials who conduct the bulk of federal government operations were brought on and set to work without even a fraction of the transparency and publicity involved in Trump’s appointment of Elon Musk. Speaking of transparency, it’s comical that a political class that classifies an estimated fifty million documents a year—ninety percent of which are 'probably unnecessary' according to some establishment legal experts—is voicing disgust over Musk’s team’s occasional use of discretion. Finally, it is appalling to hear the American political establishment criticize Elon Musk for his supposed willingness to hurt the poor and vulnerable to make himself better off. That is essentially all these people have done the entire time they’ve been in power. Over a century of government meddling in crucially important industries has made it harder for the poorest Americans to afford food, education, housing, healthcare services, and medications. Federal policies have discouraged sensible financial decisions like saving while encouraging riskier investments with politically-connected firms—just as other policies drive Americans to adopt a tragically unhealthy diet to the benefit of well-connected food, healthcare, and drug companies. And then, of course, there are the wars launched by the political establishment across the Middle East, North Africa, and now Eastern Europe. These wars have raked in trillions of dollars for weapons companies and other contractors. But they have also killed millions of people and destroyed tens of millions of lives across these regions. Understanding who the political establishment really is and what they have done makes it clear that the principles they are pretending to have when denouncing Elon Musk are fake. The establishment’s problem with Elon Musk is not that he’s willing to upend norms and test or break rules. They have shown an enthusiastic willingness to do so themselves. The establishment’s problem with Elon Musk is, put simply, that he is threatening some of their power. And to them, that is unacceptable.

Musk Calls For A ‘Thorough Review’ Of NATO	Elon Musk, billionaire and head of the U.S. Department of Efficiency, has stated that NATO requires a 'thorough review.' He expressed this opinion on X. Musk was responding to Senator Mike Lee's comment that the alliance's 'time has passed' and that the Cold War era is over. Musk has previously made sharp remarks about NATO. In March 2024, he endorsed entrepreneur David Sacks' statement that there is no reason for NATO's existence	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf4jwOP08pqdw	2025-02-12T17:13:10-08:00	
Ukraine War Transforming Russian Nation Just As Profoundly As It ...	Since Putin launched his expanded war in Ukraine in 2022, many commentators have focused on the way that war has become an important part of the genesis of a new Ukrainian nation; but almost none have focused on how it is playing an analogous function for the Russian nation, Vladimir Pastukhov says. 'I am deeply convinced that a completely different Russian society will emerge from the war than the one which entered it,' the London-based Russian analyst says (t.me/v_pastukhov/1384 reposted at echofm.online/opinions/ot-novyh-russkih-k-drugim-russkim). That is because the war in Ukraine marks 'the end of the history of post-communism with its ‘new Russians’ and the beginning of a fundamentally different era … the main character of which will be ‘the other Russian,’' a completely different person 'not having a direct historical and cultural connection with its predecessors.' The New Russian of the last 40 years 'remained a ‘recast’ Soviet and therefore imperial man, Pastukhov says. Indeed, he says he is 'beginning to think that the USSR was really the highest and final form of Russian imperialism,' while '’the other Russian’ is an emasculated and distilled product of the new era in which everything Soviet has been washed away.' The other Russian, he continues, 'actively imitates an ‘imperial’ one, but in fact he isn’t one. Instead, ‘the other Russian’ of today has the same relationship to the Russian and Soviet empires as the modern Egyptian does to the empire of the pharaohs: He simply lives on the territory of the former empire' but lacks direct connection with it or its symbols. 'In this sense,' the London-based analyst says, 'Putin’s ‘illiberal empire’ is an oxymoron: It may be anti-liberal, although that is doubtful; but it is certainly not an empire.' The other Russians who form it are 'no longer' part of an empire but they are not yet a nation,' although the war in Ukraine may yet make them one. According to Pastukhov, the Kremlin has a clearer understanding of this than do its opponents and is working to institutionalize itself by shaping the youngest members of society, hoping to 'mold golems from ‘the inhabitants’ in the hope of sitting out ‘behind the battlements’ for the time required for the golems to speak.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf__IMdCVDzTh	2025-02-12T17:09:11-08:00	
Robert Reich: Fraud And Musk – OpEd	The Trump-Musk regime is accusing federal civil servants of fraud, based on no evidence, while at the same time allowing corporations to pay off foreign officials, dropping bribery charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, pardoning a former governor of Illinois who tried to sell his Senate seat, and stopping investigations into foreign influence-peddling in the United States. In other words, Trump-Musk have declared open season on real fraud and bribery. On Monday evening, Trump signed an executive order halting investigations and prosecutions of corporate corruption in foreign countries under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. Today, Musk held forth in the Oval Office, claiming that drastic reductions in the federal workforce were justified because it was rife with fraud. I’ve spent more than a dozen years in the federal government, and I can tell you that the vast majority of civil servants I’ve had the honor of working with are dedicated and hardworking. They are delivering critical services to Americans and protecting them from corporate malfeasance. For the richest person in the world to be given a bully pulpit in the Oval Office to impugn their integrity is beyond shameful. Musk has the integrity of a slug. Since Trump was elected president, Musk’s fortune has increased $270 billion. If you think that’s an accident, you haven’t been paying attention. When Trump was sworn into office, Musk’s six corporations were under more than 32 continuing investigations conducted by at least 11 federal agencies, according to a review by The New York Times. Most of these cases are now closed or likely to be closed soon, and the agencies that initiated them are being defanged by Musk and Trump. Which means Musk’s corporations are worth far more because they are no longer restrained by the government. And as their major shareholder, Musk is the big winner. The cases against Musk and his corporations include a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing Musk and his corporations of violating federal securities laws and a lawsuit by the Federal Aviation Administration accusing him and his rocket company, SpaceX, of violating worker safety. When SpaceX’s Starship exploded in January, raining debris over the Caribbean, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the rocket program and ordered an investigation — latest in a series of moves by the agency against SpaceX. 'Safety drives everything we do at the FAA,' the agency’s chief counsel said after proposing $633,000 in fines for alleged violations related to two previous launches. 'Failure of a company to comply with the safety requirements will result in consequences.' Musk accused the agency of engaging in 'lawfare' and threatened to sue it for 'regulatory overreach.' 'The fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!' Musk wrote on X. While it’s unclear what changes Musk has in store for the FAA, current and former employees expect him to focus on the part of the agency that regulates his rocket company: the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, known as AST. When Trump took office, the National Labor Relations Board had 24 separate investigations into Musk’s corporations for violating workers’ rights. But Trump has fired three officials at that agency, including a board member — effectively stopping the agency’s ability to rule on cases. Presto, Musk and his corporations are free. Trump administration officials have also cut back scrutiny of foreign influence efforts aimed at the United States and replaced the top career Justice Department official handling corruption cases. Who knows how many investigations of Musk’s global enterprises might have been closed? All we know for sure is that Elon Musk, the richest person on the planet, who’s accusing federal civil servants of fraud, whose young minions now have access to the Treasury Department’s payment system, and who Trump has authorized to make draconian reductions in the federal workforce, will make tens of billions more. This is what oligarchy looks like. This article was published at Robert Reich's Substack	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnfyCbvh2Vx6BW	2025-02-12T17:07:57-08:00	
Message To The US And Russia: Don’t Think About Nuclear War – OpE...	By Jonathan Power War over Ukraine? It mustn’t be. Some of us believed that at the end of the Cold War in 1991 American and Soviet nuclear rockets would be left to rust and rot in their silos. Indeed, we actually saw Ukraine, where the Soviets made most of their rockets and based many, (who says that Ukraine doesn’t have an umbilical relationship with Russia?), deciding to give up its nuclear armoury—for which the world should give more praise than it does. Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush did quite a lot for nuclear disarmament. At a summit in Iceland, Reagan and Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, panicked most of their advisors and western commentators when they nearly agreed to total nuclear disarmament. Only Reagan’s misplaced persistence in demanding to keep alive research into his dream project, the 'Star Wars' anti-missile system (which could never work), and Gorbachev’s unwillingness to agree to this, perhaps fearful the politburo would be ranged against him since proof that the US had stopped this research would be difficult to come by, stymied an agreement. Both sides were equally at fault at what could have been an historic opportunity. Very little on the disarmament front Despite all his rhetoric and bear hugging of Russia’s first president, Boris Yeltsin, President Bill Clinton achieved very little on the disarmament front. His successor, George W. Bush did only a bit more, putting weapons into storage, rather than dismantling them. Hopes were focussed on Barack Obama who was chosen at the onset of his presidency to be honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize, partly because it was thought he would be a standard bearer for disarmament. Apart from an initial agreement with Russia to reduce superpower long-range rockets down from 2,200 warheads each to 1,500-k in terms of numbers significant but still enough to blow up most of civilization, Obama was able to do precious little. It wasn’t his fault. The resistance in Congress to ratifying this pact was immense and passage only came on the promise of spending $80 billion to modernise nuclear forces. Even George W. Bush junior’s plan to base an anti-ballistic missile system on Polish soil to deter Iranian missiles was modified by Obama only somewhat because of Republican resistance. It was an attempt to satisfy legitimate Russian concerns about it being used to intercept a Russian attack. More American compromise is still needed on this- it remains an issue- such as moving the site to Romania, nearer to Iran and further from Moscow and finding a way for Moscow to share the running and control of the system. The next stage in the disarmament process Turning the page, the US has not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty which would help stymie the further spread of nuclear arms to other countries. For new nuclear powers, if you can’t test you don’t know if you have a workable bomb. The next stage in the disarmament process should be getting rid of short-range tactical nuclear-tipped missiles base in Europe. Moscow is insisting that the first step must be the US removing all its tactical weapons from Europe, which is fair given their proximity to Moscow. It would be as if Russia had rocket bases in Mexico. As for cutting the number of intercontinental rockets, the last big cut was made in the time of Obama and President Dimitri Medvedev. Biden did renew the agreement, but no disarmament talks are presently planned. All this adds up to very little nuclear disarmament. Doubtless, the US Senate will be an immoveable brake on Donald Trump, as it was earlier on President Barack Obama. For his part Donald Trump in his first term wanted to upgrade the US armoury of nuclear missiles. (How can anyone say Trump was in President Vladimir Putin’s pocket?) As for the Russians, observing the power of the US Senate to probably refuse to approve any new treaties, it stops them suggesting opening negotiations. Thirty-four years after the end of the Cold War But how is it, 34 years after the end of the Cold War, that either side can justify nuclear weapons? Is Russia an enemy or is it not? Successive American presidents have said it no longer is. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barak Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden have all said it is not, even if today those alive appear to have changed their tune. The Russians say the same thing about the US and Europe. Putin until recently still called them 'our friends'. But surely non-enemies don’t have nuclear weapons pointed at each other. At least that is what basic morality and common sense would say. At the end of the Cold War nuclear weapons should have been allowed to rust. Many people in the West wanted this, probably a majority, but big media, Republican congressmen and senators, the military (although not all off it) and those earning a living in national security jobs, the intelligence services and including some academics, successfully fought to keep nuclear armouries replenished. Even though there were some powerful voices against nuclear weapons, such as former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, they were unable to resist this tide. Step back a little and look at the situation from above-—remember how earth looks like a tiny dot from photos sent back to Earth by the rocket Voyager 1 as it traverses the outer edge of the Solar System. Surely, being so inconsequential in the cosmos, we should not be tearing into each other. Maybe we have taken ourselves too seriously. But for the first 30 years after the Cold War it seemed we were moving, if not fast, at least in the right direction. There is no longer a dangerous ideological divide- Premier Nikita Khrushchev once said, 'we will bury you'. That sort of talk is gone. Communism is no longer the ruling ideology of Russia, backed by a ruthless police state that would stamp on the slightest dissent. Russia has now become capitalist, albeit with a human rights problem. In pre-Covid times its borders were open and still are for those travelling southward. The Christian religion and its moral teachings are for most Europeans, A shared culture American and Russians still the foundation of a shared culture, including ethical rules for everyday life, and the arts—literature, theatre, ballet, opera and popular music. I would guess that 80% of Russian social legislation and the penal code is similar to the West’s. Spend time with Russian families at home and at work and you will see what I mean. On human rights observance Russia is worse but not by much. Fifteen years ago, the case of the torture and death of businessman Sergei Magnitsky who had exposed serious corruption in Russian society became a hot issue on Capitol Hill. Congress decided to get tough on Russia and imposed sanctions for the first time since the end of the Cold War. However, it can’t be said this was as serious an issue as the serial human rights abuses carried out by American whites including policemen against black victims. Far many more innocents and petty criminals are locked up in America than in Russia. Russians have become angry that the US is regularly interfering in their internal affairs while failing to clean its own house. The media is largely controlled by the Putin Administration, but it does allow in Moscow an independent radio station. The internet is free. So are foreign broadcasts. Away from Moscow there are many other fairly free local papers and broadcasters, albeit on a smaller scale. If Russians want to know what is going on they can easily find out. In the West, instead of government diktat, we have press barons as owners who drive a personal or corporate agenda. The exceptions like the Guardian, Le Monde and the Christian Science Monitor which have relatively small circulations. (The BBC, although government owned, manages to maintain high-class, independent reporting and commentary, albeit on national security issues it is often self-censoring and biased against Russia and China.) So, what is it all about? Why are we allowing events around the issue of the independence of Ukraine to slip out of our control to where the warriors call the shots? Loose talk in Moscow about bringing a nuclear-armed Russian submarine up close to the US coast does not help. Neither does the present deployment of similar US submarines in the Black Sea. Since both Putin and Biden maintain they are practising Christians, I ask them how, when they meet their maker, they will explain why they kept or even used nuclear weapons that could or did kill hundreds of millions of people and make many of our cities uninhabitable? Quite rightly, we are supposed to fear God and his wrath. Christ taught us to love our enemies. Don’t the US and Russia want to set an example to the rest of the world, as is their sworn obligation under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? After all sauce for the goose is good for the gander might say the Iranians, and those in the Middle East that will probably emulate Iran if it does go nuclear. Is the US prepared to modify the expansion of NATO up to Russia’s borders that nearly 100% of Russians are angry about, and which triggered the Russian invasion of Ukraine? Is Putin prepared to give the media and NGO activists and protestors more freedom, including releasing from prison the political prisoners. Are they both prepared to initiate big new cuts in their nuclear weapons stockpiles? Trump is probably already checkmated by the intransigent forces around him. Maybe it is the same with Putin. Therefore, the world is checkmated. What a terrifying impasse this Ukraine crisis is.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf483ZgXm-4UF	2025-02-12T17:04:39-08:00	
The Power Of Black Self-Defense In Lincoln Heights – OpEd	When Nazis appear in public they must be quickly dispatched. The people of a Black town in Ohio did just that and then acted to arm and defend themselves. While there are endless think pieces written on the phenomenon of Donald Trump’s second ascendancy to the white house, working class Black people in a town near Cincinnati, Ohio took matters into their own hands and faced down a group of white supremacists. On February 7, 2025, a group of white men waving flags adorned with swastikas hung a banner from an interstate overpass between the towns of Evendale and Lincoln Heights which proclaimed, 'America for the White Man.' It must be pointed out that the statement, while quite racist, is an accurate description of United States history and politics. Trump’s promise to Make America Great Again is just the most recent expression of the historical imperative to keep white men in a position of privilege and authority in this country. The neo-Nazi group were unmolested by the local police. In the words of the police chief, they had done 'nothing unlawful.' That statement may technically be true but Black people cannot be casual about the swastika symbol being freely displayed by people who say that the white supremacist order should be maintained. Ohio is a state with a significant Black population, mostly residing in and near its large cities. Ohio was decidedly in the republicans’ camp until those Black voters who had previously been disaffected came out in support of Barack Obama in huge numbers in 2008 and 2012. But as astute observers predicted, much of that cohort disappeared when Obama’s name was no longer on the ballot. In 2016, 2020, and 2024, Ohio went back into the red state category for Donald Trump. The state is located in what is known as the 'rust belt,' the region that thrived as an industrial hub for decades until the dictates of finance capital turned the midwest into a deindustrialized state of decline. Ohio continues to lose population and the congressional seats that are determined by census results. The Black people who remain there struggle to live in an eviscerated economy, and are surrounded by conservative white people and conservative political representation. Vice President J.D. Vance was an Ohio senator before he became Trump’s running mate. But the people of Lincoln Heights did not ask for anyone’s permission to defend themselves. The neo-Nazis were quickly dispatched by a larger group of mostly Black protesters who burned their swastika decorated flags after they ran into the back of a U-Haul truck and fled the scene with a police escort. Ohio is both an open carry and concealed carry state, meaning that firearms may be carried openly or be kept hidden. After the white supremacists fled, the Lincoln Heights residents mobilized into the well organized militia described in the second amendment to the constitution. They organized themselves into patrols and walked the streets armed as the laws of their state allow them to do. Black people in a small city showed the rest of the country the importance of organizing. They acted fearlessly in the face of open racism. They didn’t consult with elected officials or public intellectuals. They knew they were in danger if they didn’t act of their volition. In all likelihood the neo-Nazis won’t make any more public displays of themselves in Lincoln Heights for a long time. The history of Lincoln Heights provides clues to why the people there rose up to defend themselves. It was the first Black-led incorporated city above the Mason-Dixon line. But nearby white suburbs literally stole land that was to have been included in Lincoln Heights and the town’s boundaries did not include local industries that employed its residents. Over time, the inability to form a tax base combined with deindustrialization made Lincoln Heights a shell of its former self. The population dropped 45% between 1970 and 2013. Trump is viewed as the ultimate nightmare for Black people in the U.S. He has won two presidential elections in large part because he speaks directly to the impulses of racist whites. Both of his elections created great angst among Black people, whose proud history of political action has been whittled down to voting and not behaving like Obama’s imaginary cousin Pookie who refuses to get off of a couch and get to a polling place. Even in Lincoln Heights, there are forces who wish to turn a teachable moment about self-defense into an opportunity for kumbaya and weak virtue signaling. While some residents patrolled the street with firearms, others attempted to supplant self-defense with prayer and a march . It was appropriate that residents demanded answers from local police and elected officials but the sight of armed Black people did much more to prevent Nazis from gaining any legitimacy than pleas for peace and love. The people who are usually considered leaders are rarely of any help to Black people in distress. Congressional Black Caucus Member and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is a case in point. While Donald Trump violates the constitution with executive orders announcing powers he does not have, Jeffries is flummoxed as to what the leader of an opposition party ought to do. 'I’m trying to figure out what leverage we actually have. What leverage do we have? They control the House and Senate and the presidency. It’s their government. What leverage do we have?' The self-own would be funny if it were not so serious. Whether he realized it or not, Jeffries admitted that democrats were ready to cut deals with Trump but now that Trump has cut them out of decision making they have no idea what to do. As for the government belonging to republicans, it is generally believed that it belongs to the people. For months we were told that Trump was an existential threat, a dictator, and a Hitler incarnate. But now that he is in office again, actual Hitler loving Nazis parade through U.S. cities with impunity and Black leaders who whine about not having leverage are certainly of no help to people facing self-proclaimed fascists. Let us all give a shout out to the people of Lincoln Heights, Ohio. The open carry and stand your ground laws weren’t meant to be for their benefit, but they acted upon them anyway.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnfx6KlferGs33	2025-02-12T16:55:23-08:00	
Impediments To Indigenous Manufacture Of Military Aircraft In Ind...	Indian Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal A.P. Singh on Monday slammed officials of the state-owned military aircraft maker Hindustan Aeronautic Ltd, for tardiness in the delivery of fighter jets and sternly asked them to be conscientious. At the Aero India 2025 exhibition in Bengaluru on Monday, the chief the Indian Air Force (IAF) Air Chief Marshal A.P. Singh publicly slammed officials of the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) for failing to meet the IAF's critical requirement of fighter jets as promised. The Hindustan Times reported that Air Marshal Singh went to the extent of saying that he has 'no confidence' in the state-run aircraft maker. 'I can only tell you our requirements and what our worries are. You have to alleviate those worries and make us more confident. At the moment, I am just not confident of HAL, which is a very wrong thing to happen,' Singh is heard saying in the clip posted on YouTube. The aircraft, which the chief had flown at the air show was said to be a Light Combat Aircraft Mk 1A. But actually it wasn't that, as it lacked many essential features. Singh pointed out that a Mk-1A will be Mk-1A only when fully fitted. The IAF had ordered 83 Mk-1A fighters for INR 480,000 million in February 2021 and plans to buy 97 more Mk-1As at a cost of around INR 67,0000 million. The first aircraft was to be delivered by March 31, 2024, but that didn't happen, partly because the US firm GE Aerospace's inability to supply the F404 engines on time. There were also delays in some key certifications. Nevertheless, HAL unveiled the LCA Mk-1A, at the air show on Monday, in a bid to allay concerns about its readiness to supply the aircraft. But Air Chief Singh was very disappointed that the plane he flew was only a partially fitted. 'I was promised when I come here in February that I will see 11 Mk-1As ready minus the engines. That is what I was promised. Not a single [fighter] is ready... You [have started] calling it Mk-1A. It is not Mk-1A. Mk-1A is after the capability comes in. Then only it is Mk-1A. The weapon has to come in. When the capability comes in, then it is Mk-1A. I find that we are just not in mission mode.' An unidentified HAL official then heard saying 'I can assure you that no stone will be left unturned. Your directions are noted.' To which the IAF chief said: ' I feel only a few are putting in effort or may be everyone is putting effort in their own silo and that the overall things are not working out. Something has to change. Something drastic has to change.' Short of Fighters The IAF is deeply concerned about the current pace of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA Mk-1A) as the delay affects the combat effectiveness of the IAF given the rise in the capabilities of both China and Pakistan, India's challengers in the immediate neighbourhood. The IAF is meant to have 42 squadrons, but for the last ten years, it has had only 30. While the government has made Atma Nirbhartha or self-reliance, as it motto, and is discouraging imports, indigenous industry has not measured up to the challenge. Quality Issue According to Air Marshal B.K. Pandey ( the quality of aircraft rolled out by HAL is questionable. Over the last 45 years, the IAF has lost as many as 1100 combat aircraft for reasons attributable largely to technical failure. That works out to an average of 24 aircraft lost per year. Of all the fleets, the IAF has experienced serious quality issues with aircraft of Russian origin of the older generation, manufactured under license and/or maintained by HAL. These include the MiG-21, MiG-27 and the MiG-29 fleets. In fact, owing to frequent crashes, the MiG-21 has acquired the nickname 'flying coffin'. Crashes occurred frequently in the MiG fleet primarily because of engine failure, Pandey says. One of the contributory factors to the poor quality of output by HAL, especially on aircraft engines, is the rush to meet production targets towards the end of the financial year. In one particular year, HAL overhauled four engines of MiG-29 aircraft in the first six months of the financial year. But in the last three months of the same financial year, under pressure to meet with deadlines, HAL completed the overhaul of four engines. Compression of time by 50% would have had a deleterious effect on the quality of work. The IAF has lost a number of Su 30 MKI aircraft on account of technical failure. In one case, two pilots flying a Su 30 MKI, while approaching the runway to land, suddenly found themselves catapulted out of the cockpit when neither of them had operated the ejection system! The overall fleet serviceability of the Su 30 MKI hovers around 55% as opposed to the stipulated minimum of 70%. Over the years, the IAF has lost 50% of its MiG fleet and nearly 200 fighter pilots. A majority of the accidents have been caused by flaws in the manufacturing or deficiencies in the overhauling process. It is not without reason that the Dassault Aviation of France was unwilling to stand guarantee for the quality of the product and the delivery schedule if it was compelled to join hands with HAL to produce the Rafale combat jet in India. This proved to be the nemesis for the eight-year bid to buy 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft. Enter Private Sector Foreign defence manufacturers are now looking to the Indian private sector for partnerships. Airbus has joined hands with Tata Advanced Systems Ltd. to produce the C-295 to replace the ageing Avro fleet of the IAF and there are reports of a similar joint venture between Airbus and Mahindra Aerospace to produce a Light Utility Helicopter. HAL's inefficiency is helping impart fresh impetus to the private sector in the Indian aerospace industry. Budget Allocation Fall Tushar Chakrabarty of the Institute for Policy Research Studies points out that allocations for defence in India's annual budgets have been falling over the years. In 2014-15, the Central government spent 17.1% of its total expenditure on defence. This increased to 17.8% in 2016-17. However, since then, the share of defence in total central government expenditure has steadily decreased. In 2024-25, the Centre is estimated to spend 12.9% of its total expenditure on defence, as compared to 13.9% at the revised estimate stage in 2023-24. According to recent reports, India's defence budget for 2025-26 allocates approximately INR 1.92 lakh crore (around US$ 22 billion) for capital expenditure, which includes buying new weapons and modernizing the military. But the recurrent expenditure (mainly salaries and pensions) stands at around INR 4.88 lakh crore (around US$ 57 billion), thus making up a significantly larger portion of the total defence budget. In most years this has been so. Between 2013-14 and 2024-25, defence pensions have increased at an annual rate of 11%. In 2024-25, 23% of the total defence budget is estimated to be spent on pensions. This leaves very little for buying or manufacturing equipment or spending on R and D.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf7y51QE7HLhO	2025-02-12T16:40:21-08:00	
Taliban Divisions Laid Bare As Power Struggle Intensifies – Analy...	By Mustafa Sarwar and Frud Bezhan (RFE/RL) -- The Taliban has for years presented a united front to the outside world and kept a tight lid on dissent within its ranks. But unprecedented displays of discord have laid bare the rifts in the secretive militant group and exposed an intensifying power struggle. The internal divisions could spill over into violence, experts warn, and trigger a new civil war that would further destabilize the volatile region. 'Despite a culture of secrecy and unity, recently there have been public shows of disunity,' said Michael Semple, a former EU and UN adviser to Afghanistan. 'These suggest that the movement is under real strain.' ‘Chaotic And Uncertain’ In December, the Taliban’s Refugees Minister Khalil Haqqani was killed in a suicide bombing. He is the most senior official to be killed since the hard-line Islamist group seized power in 2021. Privately, most of Haqqani’s supporters accused his rivals in the Taliban of ordering his assassination, according to experts. In January, a senior Taliban official left the country soon after appearing to criticize the Taliban’s spiritual leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has the ultimate say under the group’s clerical-led system. 'Follow him, but not to the extent that, God forbid, you grant him the rank of prophethood or divinity,' said Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban’s deputy foreign minister, according to an audio recording released last month. 'If you deviate even a step from God's path, then you are no longer my leader, I do not recognize you.' Stanikzai also criticized Akhundzada’s ban on girls’ education, which has provoked international condemnation. He confirmed that he was in the United Arab Emirates, but said it was due to health reasons. Reports suggest Stanikzai fled Afghanistan after Akhundzada issued a warrant for his arrest and ordered a travel ban. Meanwhile, a growing number of Taliban members have openly complained about delays to the payment of their salaries. The Taliban has denied that there are any rifts in the group. Chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the private Tolo News that the group 'will never engage in disagreements, become a source of division, or take actions that could lead to misfortune or bring instability back to the country.' But several sources in the Taliban, who spoke to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, described the current atmosphere as 'chaotic' and 'uncertain.' The sources also said that officials were banned from leaving the country unless they received authorization from Akhundzada 'These developments suggest a real challenge to the movement’s unity, between those Taliban who feel marginalized and those who feel empowered,' said Semple, a professor at Queen's University Belfast. 'We are now in new territory. The political and military opposition to the Taliban is weaker than in the 1990s,' added Semple, referring to the Taliban first stint in power. 'But the expectations of the Afghan population are much higher and the levels of popular frustration with Taliban performance are unprecedented. Unhappy Taliban know this.' Internal Competition The internal rifts in the Taliban have increasingly come to the fore since the group regained power in 2021. Akhundzada, who rarely leaves his stronghold in the southern city of Kandahar, has monopolized power, marginalized more moderate figures, and enforced hard-line policies that have made Afghanistan an international pariah. Among Akhundzada’s rivals is Sirajuddin Haqqani, the Taliban’s defense minister and leader of the Haqqani network, a powerful faction that wields significant influence in eastern Afghanistan. Others include Mullah Mohammad Yaqub, the interior minister and son of the group’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, as well as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who headed the group’s political office in Qatar and is the deputy prime minister in the Taliban cabinet. 'Recent events, particularly tensions between different factions within the Taliban, are a significant challenge to their unity, but they are not the only or necessarily the biggest threat,' said Hatef Mukhtar, director of the Afghanistan Center for Strategic Studies. There are splits in the Taliban along ideological lines. Some Taliban leaders want international recognition and economic investment, while others prioritize enforcing strict Islamic rule, even at the cost of isolation, said Mukhtar. The growing influence of the Kandahar-based leadership at the expense of former battlefield commanders and the political office is also a source of tension, Mukhtar said. Meanwhile, the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) extremist group continues to pose a threat to the Taliban, testing the group’s ability to maintain security. Underscoring that threat, IS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside a bank in northern Afghanistan on February 11 that killed five people, the Taliban said. But two Taliban sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said at least 14 were killed in the attack, including members of the group. The Taliban’s cash-strapped and unrecognized government has also come under increasing financial pressure. U.S. President Donald Trump has frozen all foreign aid, including to Afghanistan. That is likely to aggravate the devastating humanitarian crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the value of the national currency, the afghani, has plummeted in recent weeks, triggering price hikes. Experts say that while the Taliban has shown resilience in managing internal disputes, escalating tensions could threaten the group’s cohesion. The most likely scenario is 'low-level infighting, assassinations, and internal purges rather than an open military confrontation,' said Mukhtar. 'But if the Taliban fails to address its internal divisions, Afghanistan could eventually see another cycle of intra-Islamist conflict,' he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf1whE1YZnnf9Zq1YHa6Gi2	2025-02-12T16:34:39-08:00	
Russian Military Moves To Revive Secret Soviet Submarine Base – A...	By John C. K. Daly As Russia’s war against Ukraine enters its third year, Ukraine’s growing offensive capabilities have forced the Russian military to work harder to protect its assets, including its battered Black Sea Fleet (BSF) (see EDM, November 8, 2022, March 11, 26, August 13 [1], [2], 2024). Media reports indicate that Russia is now reviving 'Object 825GTS' ('Объект 825ГТС'), a Soviet-era underground submarine base in Balaklava, Crimea (Telegram/atesh_ua, January 19). Built during the Soviet era from 1953 to 1961 to house and repair diesel-electric submarines, the facility was designed to shelter submarines from aerial and nuclear attacks. Stalin personally reviewed and endorsed the Balaklava project, and was designed to survive a direct nuclear explosion of 100 kilotons (RIA Novosti, September 17, 2011). A deep-water canal, dry dock, underground roads, nuclear weapons arsenals, storage facilities for material and technical equipment, command posts, and berths were built and remained in operation until 1996 (Ibid). Even though the Ukrainian and Russian governments subsequently signed agreements about sharing BSF naval assets, the Ukrainian government decommissioned the base and turned it into a museum, as independent Ukraine had no need of it (Argumenty i fakty, June 9, 2015, November 24, 2017). In the past, the base could contain nine Project 613 diesel-electric submarines North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) designation Whiskey-class), and Project 633 submarines (NATO designation Romeo-class, a refinement of the earlier Whiskey-class), along with up to 1,500 personnel. The canal is 1,656 feet (505 meters) long, with a width of 19.6–27.8 feet (6–8.5 meters) and a depth of 19.6–27.8 feet (6–8.5 meters) (Gazeta.ru, August 21, 2020). Recent satellite imagery and Ukrainian intelligence reports show that the Balaklava site has seen increased activity. The ATESH Crimean Tatar resistance organization reports that the Russian military is building barriers in Balaklava to impede possible Ukrainian attacks with naval and aerial drones. It claimed, 'Russian occupiers in Balaklava Bay are strengthening marine engineering barriers designed to protect against unmanned boats and sabotage groups. We are actively looking for weak points in this defense' (Telegram/atesh_ua, January 19). The Balaklava site allowed submarines to enter the base through the canal, remain there unnoticed, and subsequently go directly on combat duty underwater. During the Cold War, the complex was also used to store the BSF’s nuclear-tipped torpedoes and short-range missiles. Research laboratories of almost all the Soviet Navy’s departments were located in Balaklava. It was a testing ground for the latest missiles, the first Soviet cruise and ballistic missiles, storing and servicing nuclear weapons, and providing them to BSF warships and coastal missile units (Nezavisimaia Gazeta, October 7, 2016). The secrecy of the facility was exceptional, and the base’s approaches were carefully guarded and camouflaged so that it remained concealed even from a distance of 16–32 feet (5–10 meters) (Focus.ua, January 22). The BSF’s unexpectedly mediocre performance following the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, combined with the Ukrainian military’s increasingly potent capabilities, necessitated both redeployments and increased defensive operations, heightening Balaklava’s value as opposed to Sevastopol’s open roadstead. Despite being mothballed for nearly three decades, the Balaklava facility has received renewed interest. Prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BSF had seven submarines in service. Shortly before the war began, the BSF’s Project 636.3 Varshavianka-class (NATO designation Improved Kilo-class), B-265 Krasnodar, and B-261Novorossiisk boats were deployed to the Russian Navy’s Mediterranean squadron based in Tartus, Syria (Investigator.org.ua, February 9, 2022; Ukrainska Pravda, June 30, 2022). Four days after the full-scale invasion, Türkiye invoked its restrictions on warships transiting the Turkish Straits under the 1936 Montreux Convention, effectively marooning the two submarines in the Mediterranean until the war ended (see Black Sea Battleground, May 10, 2022;24 Kanal, January 21, 2023). The BSF’s five boats remaining in the Black Sea were the 877В Paltus-class Alrosa (NATO designation: Kilo-II class)—undergoing repairs—and the Project 636.3 Varshavianka-class B-237 Rostov-na-Donu, B-262 Staryi Oskol, B-265 Velikii Novgorod, and B-271 Kolpino—all equipped with Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles (RIA Novosti, May 13, 2021; Ukrainska Pravda, May 13, 2022). Ukrainian naval operations in the Black Sea were remarkably successful. This was especially notable as the Ukrainian Navy had virtually ceased to exist. In its greatest accomplishment, on April 13, 2022, the Ukrainian military launched two Neptun cruise missiles at the BSF’s flagship, the missile cruiser Moskva, which sank the next day (Interfaks-Ukraina, April 13, 2022). Ukrainian cruise missiles would also target docked ships as well as the BSF headquarters in Sevastopol. On August 2, 2024, Ukraine launched 10 British-supplied Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles, sinking the B-237 Rostov-na-Donuattack submarine in drydock, previously attacked Crimea in September 2023, the first combat loss of a Soviet or Russian submarine since World War II (Interfaks-Ukraina, August 7, 2023; see EDM, August 13, 2024). For Ukraine, the destruction of even one Russian cruise-missile submarine was a substantial victory. The BSF was left with three combat-ready submarines, including the Staryi Oskol, Velikii Novgorod, and Kolpino. Following the assault, the BSF transferred their submarines from Sevastopol to Novorossiisk (Defense Express, August 21, 2024). Unfortunately for the BSF, the beam of both the Alrosa and the Kalibr-armed Varshaviankas (width of 32.4 feet [9.9 meters]) precluded their passing into the Balaklava facility with its 19.6–27.8 feet (6–8.5 meter) width. It seems evident that Balaklava, unless expanded, can currently only house smaller surface ships (24 Kanal, January 22). During World War II, after the Nazis captured Sevastopol, the Black Sea Fleet was transferred to Novorossiisk. In an example of history repeating itself, in September 2022, seven months after the beginning of Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BSF’s Kilo-class submarines were withdrawn to the relative safety of Novorossiisk, a secondary naval base where they currently operate (The Moscow Times, November 19, 2022). While the new U.S. administration proposes peace initiatives, the closure of the Turkish Straits, a consequence of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war, has severed the link between the Mediterranean squadron and the Black Sea Fleet, leaving Russia’s warships isolated and vulnerable to Ukrainian attack. As Russia is determined to hold Crimea and has been reinforcing the peninsula’s defenses, reworking Balaklava makes sense, as its size restrictions presently render it unsuitable for its original purpose. In any event, the war has shown the BSF’s shortcomings in an unfavorable light, which will necessitate substantial reforms following the cessation of hostilities. About the author: Dr. John C. K.

Trump Tariffs Revive Dormant Alaska LNG Project – Analysis	By Arman Sidhu The Alaska LNG project, a long-delayed initiative to transport natural gas from the resource-rich US state of Alaska to global markets, has reemerged from the political wilderness following an agreement signed last month by the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation and the Glenfarne Group, a New York-based infrastructure developer. Furthermore, an executive order issued by the Trump administration has added significant heft to the project’s viability by removing costly federal barriers to the project. The Trump administration’s reintroduction of tariffs targeting key US allies, including Japan and South Korea, has led both nations to reconsider their previously tepid view of Alaskan LNG as a potential concession to Washington in exchange for tariff relief. The project, estimated at $44 billion, involves constructing an 800-mile pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to a liquefaction facility. Once operational, it could provide up to 20 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) annually, with Japan and South Korea as primary customers. The project also touts local job creation, infrastructure investment, and long-term state revenues for Alaska. Beyond its economic appeal, Alaska’s gas is of considerable use for furthering US geopolitical goals. US allies in Asia seeking to reduce dependence on Russian and Qatari LNG have limited options due to geography and sanctions. Once operational, the Alaska LNG would offer another avenue of import diversification. However, the venture still needs to overcome doubts over its profitability in order to secure private investment, namely stemming from its projected high overhead costs and competition from cheaper LNG sources in the Gulf of Mexico, Qatar, and Australia. The Winding History of Alaska LNG Efforts to develop Alaska’s natural gas reserves date back to the completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) in 1977, though various proposals have been stalled by fluctuating energy prices, lack of buyers, and high infrastructure costs. The project gained traction under the first iteration of the Trump administration in 2017, which sought to prioritize US LNG exports. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the project in 2020, and despite overcoming legal challenges in court, the project was de-prioritized by the Biden administration due to environmental concerns. The effects of the executive order signed by Trump last month include accelerating resource development, expediting permitting and investment incentives while rolling back regulations. Despite this support, realizing the potential of the Alaska LNG project will require diplomatic support from the two largest prospective buyers of the gas: South Korea and Japan. Alaska’s US Senator Dan Sullivan visited Tokyo and Seoul in 2022, 2023, and 2024 as part of an effort to gauge interest and support for the project, which was initially tepid among South Korean and Japanese officials but appears to have shifted amid the threat of US tariffs. Searching for Diversified LNG Imports in the Indo-Pacific Japan and South Korea, both major LNG importers, have been reassessing their energy security since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia has expanded its Arctic LNG projects despite Western sanctions, which have struggled to disrupt German demand for Russian gas. Japan, which has already pared its involvement with Russia’s Sakhalin-2 gas fields, remains exposed to geopolitical risk stemming from its Russian supply lines, which provided9% of its LNG imports last year. Tokyo has indicated an intent to reduce this reliance on Russian energy even further. South Korea has voluntarily slashed imports of Russian natural gas, even without the adoption of sanctions on Russia, with most of Seoul’s LNG now coming from Australia, Qatar, and the United States. In tandem with its reduction of Russian gas, South Korean companies have diversified through an increase in imports from Malaysia and Oman, among others. Recent reports suggest Japan is considering an investment pledge in the Alaska LNG project as a bargaining chip in broader trade negotiations, even though Tokyo still has reservations about the venture ever being realized. Nevertheless, while concerns over cost competitiveness persist, the need for a stable North American supply source keeps the project in play. Qatar remains a dominant LNG supplier with the 3rd largest export capacity globally, but many Asian buyers seek diversification amid Qatar’s complicated role in regional geopolitics. Furthermore, significant capex spending planned by Qatar is expected to expand Qatari LNG export volumes by up to 85% by 2027, potentially saturating the market and forcing the United States to compete on smaller margins. Yet it’s enduring geopolitical concerns that may push Japan and South Korea to support alternative sources like Alaskan LNG, even at higher initial costs, as a way to diversify imports and mitigate the impact of any potential US tariffs. Beyond Japan and South Korea, Alaskan LNG is well-positioned to expand market share in other key Indo-Pacific nations seeking to diversify their energy imports. The Philippines is experiencing declines in its offshore gas production and is eager to transition away from coal, representing a viable future market once construction of regasification facilities are complete. Additionally, Thailand and Vietnam, both of whom mirror the Philippines in expanding LNG regasification facilities, are potential customers looking for reliable North American gas sources to offset dependence on regional suppliers. Taiwan, heavily dependent on LNG for its electricity sector, is another buyer seeking stable, long-term contracts, though such a move would prompt criticism by China. These markets align with the broader US Indo-Pacific strategy of strengthening economic and energy ties while countering Chinese influence in the region. Conclusion The Alaska LNG pipeline is more expensive than other alternatives due to its remote location, frigid climate, and expensive overhead associated with its construction. The 800-mile pipeline must traverse harsh Arctic terrain, requiring costly engineering solutions to prevent permafrost damage, among other challenges. Unlike facilities in the US states of Texas and Louisiana, the Alaska LNG project would require entirely new liquefaction and export terminals, further driving up start-up costs. Additionally, labor and material expenses are significantly higher in Alaska compared to Texas and Louisiana due to its isolated geography. Thus, despite the recent political backing, securing investment for the Alaska LNG project remains a challenge. The $44 billion price tag makes it one of the most expensive LNG projects globally. Japan and South Korea’s interest in reducing reliance on Russian and Qatari LNG adds a sense of urgency. Yet the economic argument for the project still has several critics to win over. Whether this revived push by the Trump administration and Alaskan state leaders results in construction remains uncertain, but the project’s implications for US energy security and its influence in the Indo-Pacific would be significant.

Will 2025 Mark The Beginning Of Practically Useful Quantum Comput...	By Prateek Tripathi A major impediment facing quantum computing was that of scalability, the ability to significantly increase the number of qubits in a quantum computer. This has been particularly difficult in light of error correction, which has been a problem pretty much since the genesis of quantum computers. There have been several attempts to address the issue, but none of them panned out. In 2024, however, some developments have shown real promise. In particular, in a paper recently published in Nature, Google has claimed that it has been able to surmount this obstacle using its 'Willow' quantum processor, thereby paving the way for large-scale quantum computers to become a practical reality in the near future. The problem of error correction and scalability Unlike classical computers, which use bits as carriers of information, quantum computers use qubits for the same purpose. These qubits are particles such as photons (particles of light), electrons, etc. Since these are microscopic particles, they exhibit quantum behaviour and are incredibly susceptible to the external environment. The slightest disturbance due to temperature fluctuations or electromagnetic fields can cause the information contained by them to start decaying, a phenomenon known as quantum decoherence or 'noise,' which is the primary obstacle in building quantum computers. While it is impossible to completely remove noise from the system, the objective is to limit it to the extent of providing sufficient time for computation. This is called quantum error correction. Due to noise, the physical qubits comprising the quantum computer get eaten up by the system, which then drastically reduces the number of functional or 'logical' qubits - the ones which are capable of performing computations. So, for instance, the maximum number of physical qubits in a quantum processing chip is a little over 1,000, a feat which has been achieved by both IBM and Atom Computing, a California-based startup. However, these have limited practical utility due to a lack of error correction. Up until recently, quantum error correction has been notoriously difficult to achieve. However, without it, it is impossible to build large-scale quantum computers, which is why there has been a shift in the industry towards error correction and scalability rather than simply increasing the number of physical qubits in the system. The Willow chip and Google’s assertions While Google had staked its claim for achieving 'quantum supremacy' as far back as 2019 with the announcement of its 54-qubit Sycamore processor, it did not make much headway subsequently. On December 9, 2024, it announced its 105-qubit Willow quantum processor with the claim that it could perform a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task which would take the second-fastest supercomputer in the world, Frontier, about 10 septillion (1025) years to accomplish. Though this may seem like a major accomplishment, the fact is that this is true for a benchmark computation called Radar Cross Section (RCS) and has virtually no practical utility. What was much more interesting, however, was the assertion that Willow’s error correction increases exponentially as its qubits are scaled up. The team at Google’s Quantum AI has shown with Willow that as the qubits were made larger, they made half as many errors as the physical qubits comprising them. If this increase is sustainable, it will pave the way for more large-scale quantum computers which get better at computation as the number of qubits increases, an unprecedented achievement. Other key attempts at achieving scalability In November 2024, Microsoft and Atom Computing were able to demonstrate a computation using 24 logical qubits using neutral atoms, the highest number to date. To put this into perspective, as per Microsoft’s Logical Qubit Roadmap, reaching 100 logical qubits will provide a scientific advantage by solving scientific problems, which classical computers are incapable of. Subsequently, reaching 1000 logical qubits will provide an industrial advantage by enabling the discovery of novel material compounds. Along with the release of its Condor processor, IBM had also announced its decision to shift more towards error correction and scalability. In November 2024, it provided the world’s first demonstration of two quantum processing units (QPUs) working in tandem to execute a circuit beyond the capabilities of each processor. This is part of IBM’s broader goal of 'modular quantum computing,' wherein multiple QPUs will work in concert and provide scalable quantum computers. What it means for the future of quantum computers The biggest hurdle for quantum computing till date, particularly from an investment point-of-view, has been the lack of its practical utility and applications. The absence of any tangible results detracts investors since they have no guarantee for returns on their investment. The lack of efficient quantum error correction has been the chief culprit behind this since the utility of quantum computers is limited primarily by a lack of scalability. For quantum computing, 2024 witnessed a sharp shift towards enhanced error correction and scalable quantum computers. This may provide the impetus for private investment in the field, which, up until now, has largely been driven by government investment, particularly in Global South nations like India, which do not have Big Tech firms like IBM and Microsoft. The landscape of quantum computing is steadily shifting, and 2025 may turn out to be the breakthrough year the technology has been striving towards. The recent announcement of four Thematic Hubs under India’s National Quantum Mission is an excellent starting point for the country to establish its foundation in quantum technology. The practical utility of quantum computers will bring in the much-required investment from private players and startups, which is sorely needed to spur innovation in the field.

Cambodia’s Strong Economy, Weak Society Duality – Analysis	By Mark Vong 2024 marked Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet’s first full year in office. The economy performed well while political freedoms continued to be constrained. But a strong economy and weak society may open the door for institutional reforms critical for sustained development and the Cambodian People’s Party’s (CPP) popularity. Such reforms could foster further growth and offer a glimpse of hope for political liberalisation, although this remains highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. Cambodia’s economy is projected to have grown by more than 5 per cent in 2024, driven by robust exports to traditional markets and emerging ones under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Cambodia’s economic base has been gradually diversifying from the dominant garment industry, with the value of non-garment exports rising more than five-fold relative to 2016. The number of international tourists has recovered and surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with the country receiving more than 6 million visitors in 2024. Years of solid economic growth and social development have enabled Cambodia to meet the criteria to graduate from the status of Least Developed Country (LDC) for the second time in 2024, after doing so already in 2021. Having reached this milestone twice, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that Cambodia will cease to be an LDC by the end of 2029. But resilient economic development unfolded against the backdrop of a weakening civil and political society. According to the human rights group LICADHO, many opposition officials and supporters, labour unionists, land and environmental activists and journalists were detained or sentenced in 2024. Incitement to cause social unrest — often expressed on social media — was one of the most common charges laid by the court. Others faced defamation lawsuits. The president of the Candlelight Party was ordered to pay US$1.5 million to the government for criticising the state of democracy in Cambodia in an interview with Nikkei Asia. This duality can have important implications for the prospects of political liberalisation in Cambodia. The country’s impending exit from LDC status will bring tremendous economic challenges, including the loss of access to trade preferences and concessional financing, making exports and borrowing more expensive. The United Nations Development Program’s modelling shows that exports could drop by 2.4 per cent in 2030, leading to a GDP contraction of 2 per cent and the loss of 168,000 jobs. To avert this dip, the organisation recommends, among others, measures to enhance Cambodia’s competitiveness including anti-corruption, civil service and judicial reforms. A sluggish economic performance would dent the CPP’s right to rule. Unlike the economic downturn during COVID-19, the government would not be able to blame external factors. With five years of preparation for an orderly transition, the government’s capacity to navigate the new trade environment would be sharply questioned if robust economic growth came to a halt. With claims of liberation and electoral legitimacy increasingly lacking, performance legitimacy based on capable governance and economic development is the new anchor for the CPP’s popularity. Hun Manet has to demonstrate that ‘the CPP deserves to run the state — not because it built it, but because it can run it better than other parties’. Faced with this legitimacy threat, the government can be expected to take administrative reforms with heightened urgency. If more effective institutions are to emerge from serious political commitments, Cambodia would take on a cyclical development path — weak institutions would first be harnessed to drive economic development which would later create new problems that propel the government to build stronger institutions, supporting further economic growth. From the CPP’s perspective, a weak political opposition provides a rare window of opportunity for institutional strengthening. Without a viable challenger in the electoral arena, the CPP can afford to focus less on cutthroat electioneering and more on bureaucratic rationalisation to improve the state’s extractive and administrative capacities. If attained, development-driven reforms can give Cambodia a capable state and even a relatively functioning and predictable legal system, both conducive to business competitiveness. But it would not necessarily foster democratic accountability. This configuration of a relatively effective state without accountability characterises some moderately developed authoritarian states like Vietnam. Relative to a failed state or a dysfunctional democracy, this outcome could be more desirable for many. The CPP leadership viewed the Western-imposed democratic transition in the early 1990s as inevitable due to extreme aid dependency at that time. But if future political liberalisation occurs, it will likely happen on Cambodia’s own terms, meaning the CPP would decide when and how to liberalise. According to the democracy through strength theory, democratic elections could be sanctioned under two conditions — when threats force the ruling elites to see elections as a new legitimation formula for their survival, and when strong developmental track records bolster their confidence in winning those elections. Cambodia is in the process of building such developmental track records and its success will require effective institutions. How Hun Manet reshapes the party-state in the next five years will be pivotal for economic development and by extension, political liberalisation in Cambodia.

Malaysia’s European Friendshoring – Analysis	Prime Minister Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim's working visit to four countries in Europe and the World Economic Forum participation in January remains a mission to deepen the economic framework and a strategic initiative to strengthen the capacity for economic and diplomatic friendshoring, in boosting Malaysia's fallback options. This effort aims to expand the nation's economic interdependence and market networks, in line with efforts to enhance current ties with the Western framework that can provide new guarantees, apart from the efforts to engage the Global South. This serves as a strategic tool for two main factors: first, maintaining the fundamentals of the national economic structure based on the conventional core facets of current economic tenets based on manufacturing, electronics, and natural resource sectors that require sustainable and consistent markets; and second, seeking investment sources and guarantees of technological support and expertise in the country's transition toward a digital and high-tech economy. This is centred on critical sectors, including Artificial Intelligence, semiconductors, renewable energy, big data, and critical minerals such as rare earth elements, against the backdrop of an increasingly intense, uncertain, and challenging geopolitical stage. The results of each visit have yielded their own returns, ranging from ventures of new cooperation in renewable energy and green energy transitions, as well as conventional energy cooperation in oil and gas, to joint efforts in addressing climate change and the Middle East conflict while ensuring global stability. Efforts to position Malaysia as an international hub in these critical sectors, including the advancement of digital economy, and its aspiration to become the 'Silicon Valley of the East,' require wisdom in navigating external power competition and ensuring inflows of capital, expertise, and highly skilled human capital. These are necessary to strengthen internal capabilities to attract foreign injections to develop local industries and the capacity of domestic human capital, producing a positive chain impact on national development. This aligns with the objectives of improving social mobility, quality of life, and raising total income for the local populace, and in the ultimate drive towards a high income nation. The visits aim to ensure Malaysia gains the necessary attention from major global economic powers, including economic cooperative groupings and organizations. These platforms enable the structuring and integration of financial capital, investment policy planning, and more organized and holistic synergy efforts to accelerate investment policy targets and economic cooperation scopes, bringing benefits to the country. The country's economic transformation requires external capital and expertise injections. Reliance on external powers and markets must also be carefully crafted to ensure the future capacity of the nation's trade remains guaranteed, in ensuring strong partners in the past are not neglected for the chase to join the bandwagon of the rise of the alternatives. As a maritime and trading nation, where stability and market openness are entirely dependent on external economic powers receiving the country's main exports—especially commodities and natural resources—the sustainability of local industries and returns to local workers and citizens can be ensured, by looking at the bigger picture in the long term. Two main factors—confidence and desire from foreign investors in industries and private sectors, as well as strong diplomatic and economic reliance with major global economic powers—become the main drivers in ensuring overall synergy in economic returns and sustainable sectors for the country. Thus, efforts to boost the competitiveness and resilience of the national economy depend heavily on external factors, and the economic friendshoring initiative becomes one of the required leaps to attract direct investments and strengthen comprehensive relations with economic powers that play a direct role in export markets and local economic capacity development through newly outlined industries and sectors. With external injections in terms of capital and expertise, internal dynamics will also be accelerated with chain impacts on high-skilled human capital development, infrastructure empowerment, reducing unemployment rates, and increasing high-quality and high-income employment. Development gaps in terms of geography, demographics, skills, and education can be addressed with consistent and pragmatic economic transformation efforts that must adapt to current geopolitical changes and economic realities. The country is diversifying its economic reliance through alternative systems like the Global South and BRICS, but Western technological expertise and capital remain critical. Pragmatic and Strategic Plan In the country's efforts to break free from the old economic model reliant on manufacturing, exports, and commodities, shifts based on future realities must move in tandem. This requires pragmatic policies and wisdom to reap long-term returns, whose outcomes will not manifest overnight. Guaranteeing returns in the context of economic transformation preparations for the long term—including the National Semiconductor Strategy and the New Industrial Master Plan—requires overall synergy to secure returns from all sectors, including defense, security, diplomacy, and foreign policy, not limited to economic and trade development plans alone. To ensure holistic returns, it is necessary to strengthen conventional ties and open new opportunities to attract global industry leaders and deepen relations with emerging economic powers. In the era of geopolitical competition and intense economic and investment rivalry, particularly in critical sectors, economic and defense friendshoring is key in securing trust and confidence with key global industries and networks. This involves leveraging the country's unique strengths, including geography, infrastructure, a complete transportation network, demographic advantages, human capital base, government policies, and investment and business incentives. These factors complement robust economic growth efforts, focusing on high-tech and digital technology sectors, the blue economy, new energy economy, and leveraging platforms like ASEAN and Malaysia's ASEAN Chairmanship to position the country as a high-tech investment hub in the region. Capabilities such as the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and ASEAN's broad market appeal, coupled with Malaysia's collaborative efforts within ASEAN, are assets to ensure Malaysia emerges as an influential middle power. This positions Malaysia to play a more significant role on the global economic, diplomatic, and geopolitical stage, beyond the ASEAN platform alone. Expanding influence through partnerships with strategic state actors and relevant regional and international organizations is a primary plan to ensure Malaysia's presence and relevance in global geopolitical and power dynamics remains dynamic and resilient. Beyond economic, geopolitical, and defense platforms, these diplomatic and friendshoring efforts are also critical in forming joint networks to address universal threats such as climate change, food security, supply chain resilience, and digital threats.This is even more critical amidst ongoing global power struggles, political uncertainty, and traditional and non-traditional threats undermining supply chains, food security, energy security, and regional stability. To position Malaysia on the global stage and ensure the nation remains secure in terms of stability and safety, formulating successful action plans or goals without risks is challenging. All this requires wisdom, past legacy experience, and the capacity and capability of top leadership to navigate new pathways and face challenges in a new era, guided by the principle that there are no permanent friends or enemies in international relations, only permanent interests. Building Trust and Confidence High-level trust and confidence between the country's top leaders and non-state actors are essential to ensure smooth policy and strategy implementation. Without direct friendships and esprit de corps at the individual level, relationships will revolve solely around formal and Track I boundaries. This affects the scope, intensity, and sustainability of multilateral cooperation, especially in diverse sectors. Close ties between leaders also serve as critical reliance factors to address arising concerns, internal issues, and potential conflicts early. This allows leaders to manage and prevent these challenges and issues from escalating and threatening bilateral relations. This role is best carried out by top leaders, highlighting the importance of Prime Minister Anwar's close personal relationships with his counterparts. Trust and reliance based on these relationships are key factors in shaping other actors' policies toward Malaysia. Under Prime Minister Anwar, Malaysia is actively positioning ASEAN as a new economic and geopolitical force capable of revitalizing global economic growth while serving as a stabilizer for regional and global security dynamics. However, internal constraints within ASEAN persist, including intense competition among member states, limited intra-regional trade, and policy divisions in responding to external geopolitical dynamics. Malaysia is working to improve ASEAN's collective composition, ensuring the region's overall economic strength becomes a major attraction, especially in critical new sectors where each member state plays a role. This reduces internal competition and uses shared strengths strategically. As ASEAN Chair, Malaysia must uphold universal values that have long guaranteed global stability and peace, rooted in international norms and laws. These values emphasize peace, freedom, inclusive development, ethics, universal moral values, and human rights, advancing sustainable development for all demographics. Malaysia's leadership in ASEAN reflects its 'Madani' concept, promoting balanced and future-focused civilizational progress. Diplomatic friendshoring is critical to building trust and confidence, ensuring security cooperation based on shared understanding and threats. Early economic interventions and strategies to expand ASEAN's relevance and role with organizations like GCC, BRICS, Global South, EU, OIC, WTO, and WEF are fallback measures to ensure broader networks for fostering universal values, peace norms, and sustainable economic and humanitarian development.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40uOUGFZEdowZ	2025-02-10T16:46:33-08:00	
The Rise Of Right-Wing Extremism: Islamism In Damascus – Analysis	As early as 2011, during the initial days of the Arab Spring, I anticipated the rise of Islamist imperialism within the global rise of right-wing exclusionary movements. The events continued to follow that same catastrophic trajectory as the extreme right from Indonesia and the Indian Subcontinent to the Middle East and the Caucuses to Europe and the United States kept rising. In 2019, I wrote again about Islamism and the neo-Ottoman project. By the fall of 2023, it became clear that the Middle East had reached the abyss. With the Islamist takeover of Damascus in late 2024, we can see the abyss looking back at us. As for what is left of the left near and around the dying center, the anti-Marxist apologia and culturalist morality have turned them into little more than pantomimes adamantly committed to universal discrimination. Just as the advocates of liberation theology desperately need to be liberated from theology, the Arab Springers need an Indian summer with the Naxalite, and the Occupiers need to historically materialize a way out of the private parks of idealism. The so-called transitional government in Syria is a show directed by the Islamists as a diversion until they consolidate their grip on power. It is a devastating mistake to assume that the Islamist movement in Syria might somehow be different than other Islamist movements and that it would potentially respect human dignity, rights, and freedoms at any individual or collective level. In 2011, a civilian movement for democracy started, but it was quickly highjacked by the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda affiliated groups in a way not dissimilar to the Islamist highjacking of the 1979 Iranian revolution. Ironically, for twelve years, from 2012 to 2024, Syria became a hot conflict zone between Shia Islamism, managed by Tehran and represented by its proxies, and Sunni Islamism, overseen by Ankara and performed by its proxies. Assad’s regime was secular, but its brutal deployment of force against civilians made its fall only a matter of time. The Russian Federation tried to save the regime, but instead of going all the way against the Turkish-backed Islamists, in 2018 and afterward, Putin made a series of deals with Erdogan leaving parts of Northern Syria under the rule of the Sunni Islamists. Assad’s forces might have been able to take over Idlib, but Putin did not give them permission to make any further advances. In the meantime, Assad increasingly relied on Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed Shia Islamist militia to maintain his already deeply compromised rule. Those who saved his regime for over a decade also compromised the Syrian sovereignty continually sidelining the government in Damascus. Most notably, Hezbollah and the Iranian regime used Syrian territory to transfer and accumulate rockets threatening Israel while Putin made personal deals with Erdogan at the expense of the Syrian state. At the end of November 2024, after Hezbollah forces in both Syria and Lebanon had just suffered the heaviest and deadliest attacks by the Israeli air forces thus far, the Sunni Islamists backed by Turkey seized the moment and started their attack in three directions, south, east, and west. Erdogan knew that that was the moment to safely trash his former agreements with Putin. The Kremlin was too consumed by the war in Ukraine to risk a confrontation for Assad’s sake. Meanwhile, the Iranian regime had already been overwhelmed by crises and fears, especially following the rapid destruction of the Hezbollah forces and the rumors that the Khamenei regime was next on Israel’s list. Knowing that Trump’s return to the White House would only make the Israeli plan to go after the ruling regime in Tehran more daring, Khamenei was not in any position to gamble on Assad’s behalf. Also given the fact that Iranians have been desperately waiting for any opportunity to finally bring down the Islamic Republic, the mullahs in Tehran were not going to do for the secular Bashar al-Assad what they did not dare to do for their beloved Hasan Nasrallah. From their perspective, engaging in external conflicts is supposed to prolong the survival of the regime in Tehran not put it at further risk. Thus, Tehran and Moscow finally left Assad’s regime for its fate. Erdogan was the one who laughed all along and laughs now as jihadis loyal to him are in full control of Damascus for the first time. He has been manipulating the Kremlin, the White House, and the EU leaders while steadily advancing his imperialist project as the new sultan and caliph. The longer the West and the Russian Federation are entangled in strategic conflicts, the better for Erdogan who never fails to miss any opportunity to use both sides. What is coming will not be any less bloody for Syrians and others in the region. ISIL was a mere experimental and tactical project for Sunni Islamism. Seeing himself as the tactful, patient, and pragmatic sultan and would-be caliph, Erdogan has secured the support of both NATO and the Kremlin for his caliphate enterprise. Despite the legitimate wishes of Syrians from all backgrounds for a peaceful and inclusive Syria, what is about to unfold these days, the last weeks of 2024, is not a transition to a democratic state; it is a transition to an Islamic state. This is Al-Qaeda for the first time assuming the role of the government and a re-former of a state following the fall of its capital city. Just like some of the Taliban leaders, some within the Al-Qaeda movement have learned how to put up a less violent fasad. If anything, this version of Islamism is far more dangerous than the openly terroristic one because it lures people in much larger numbers into its fatal trap. Unlike Mulla Omar and Bin Laden, the Islamists within this wave have been trained in PR for pragmatic purposes. The Taliban leaders were trained in Qatar while the new Al-Qaeda leaders received their PR training in Turkey. Also, unlike Zarqawi and Baghdadi, these Islamists have been taught not to broadcast their crimes of beheading, stoning, and burning people alive. They are trained not to shout slogans of total destruction, collective enslavement, or anything too indicative of their global enterprise of jihad. They have been taught that to become professional politicians they should never reveal what they intend to do. Following the Muslim Brotherhood school and the Erdogan doctrine in particular, they only express what they never intend to do. The ISIL experiment proved that while broadcasting brute terrorism may attract more fanatics in the West, Africa, and Asia, in the long run, it diminishes an Islamic state’s chances of survival in the international arena. Today most Islamists know that the ISIL version of a caliphate is doomed to fail. Therefore, the dominant model of Islamism avoids commercializing and broadcasting gruesome terror. For most Sunni Islamists, the role model is Erdogan. Like the Turkish sultan, they make an effort to sound calm, principled, and almost tolerant precisely in order to deceive liberals into believing that this version of Islamism is different. They capitalize on the false belief that there is such a thing as moderate Islamism. This is not an entirely new Islamist strategy. In fact, it is more of a return to the original strategies and techniques of the Muslim Brotherhood. Both are ultra-right with similar strategies and goals, but they differ in terms of their preferred tactics. Bin Laden and Zawahiri diverged from the Muslim Brotherhood when they adopted the method of commercialized terrorism. In the years following the fall of the Baath regime in Iraq, Zarqawi, the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and Baghdadi, the leader of ISIL, took commercialized terror to a more extreme level. ISIL ran its course, and when it became clear to the Turkish secret intelligence that ISIL was not salvageable, the ISIL members were simply given new uniforms to join or found other Islamist groups. Those groups rule Damascus now. The Muslim Brotherhood, to which Erdogan belongs ideologically as an Islamist, has always been pragmatic. Their leaders know when and how to exploit liberalism. They use whatever means possible to have a grip on power. Once they are in power, things will only get worse for everyone and every group including Muslims, Arabs, and Turks, but it will certainly get even worse for non-Muslims, Kurds, Yezidis, Armenians, Assyrians, and other minoritized groups. In terms of Sunnis and Shias, wherever Islamism rules, one group is brutalized by the other. The Assad regime was secular, but because of its alliance with Shia Islamism, Sunni Islamists saw its fall as a historic victory over the Shias. Indeed, they have been emphasizing the symbolic significance of conducting prayer rituals in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, something Erdogan personally expressed wishes for when Assad was still the ruler of Damascus. The fall of Damascus into the hands of the Sunni Islamists will have many international ramifications as well. I do not think this will decrease the threat to Israel in any way, which means the wars and destruction will only intensify. The Shia Islamists and Assad talked tough, but they always knew that their main enemy was the Sunni Islamists, so they would have been happy keeping the conflict with Israel manageable for both sides, the Israelis as well as themselves. That is how the ruling Iranian regime operates too. It will never deliberately put its fate at serious risk for the sake of Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Yemenis, or Iranians for that matter. Shia Islamism’s anti-Zionist discourse is mostly for Islamic consumption. Shia Islamism always favors full propaganda wars, but on the ground, it usually restrains from doing any foolish thing that might drag the whole Shia camp into a war with Israel or the United States. However, in 2024, Hezbollah miscalculated Israel’s potential reaction. Israel too went a step too far weakening Hezbollah in Syria so severely that the balance of forces on the ground abruptly changed in the interest of the Sunni Islamists backed by Turkey. Erdogan seized the opportunity to unleash the Sunni Islamist forces to invade Aleppo. The rest happened faster than what Syrian, Israeli, Turkish, Iranian, and Russian officials expected. When Assad’s own army did not put up a fight in Aleppo, it became clear that the Iranian, Lebanese, and Iraqi Shia militias were not prepared to fight for Assad. Unlike Shia Islamists, Sunni Islamists do not feel psychologically pressured to prove their fidelity to the Islamic project of jihad. Shia Islamists’ take the Sunni majority’s suspicions and distrust of Shias for granted. As a result, Shia Islamists exaggerate in their propaganda, often becoming victims of their own media war. Sunni Islamists, on the other hand, plot, act, and then speak, so they make more professional terrorists. Sunni Islamism has always aimed to revive the Islamic caliphate. Inspired by his hero, Selim I, Erdogan aims to be the sultan who is also the Caliph, and he has been perceived as such by most Sunni Islamists. Therefore, to them, while Aleppo and Damascus are important gains in themselves, they are, more importantly, two steps closer to Jerusalem, following Selim I’s exact map of conquests. From their perspective, after Damascus comes Jerusalem, then Egypt, and finally Mecca and Madina. By taking over Mecca and Madina, the neo-Ottoman sultan would become the Caliph. Be it as it may, what is coming most likely will be much worse. Bashar al-Assad’s reliance on Hezbollah and Iranian Shia militias for all those years of the civil war was a mistake pragmatically and otherwise. Something his father, Hafez al-Assad, would have avoided. He made an even more fatal mistake after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq when he made Syria a corridor for the passage of Sunni Islamists to Iraq. Some of those same Islamists brought back jihad to Syria. That is exactly how the likes of al-Jolani emerged in such large numbers following the 2011 uprisings. Also, Bashar al-Assad trusted and supported the Iraqi Baathists, another strategic mistake Hafez al-Assad would never have committed. Many former Iraqi officers and secret police agents started recruiting Sunni jihadis in Syria, especially after 2008. Bashar al-Assad is not the only state leader who made the fatal mistake of playing with Islamists. All those who tried to use Islamists ended up being used by Islamists. Islamism emerged first and foremost as an anti-communist movement. The most universal feature of fascism across places and times is an anti-communist fever. Despite drastic ideological differences and political conflicts among them, all fascist forces are eager to go after the last communists in the world. While it shares myths of origin and sources of inspiration with many premodern forces and movements, Islamism is a modern movement. It was born in the 20th century. The history of Islamism is remarkably similar to the history of European fascism. Like European fascism, Islamism was born primarily as an anti-communist and an anti-democratic movement when Marxian communism was on its way to becoming an international grassroots movement of universal emancipation. Communism was the first universal movement to threaten various regimes of social inequalities and political oppressions on such a vast scope and so overwhelmingly. The conservative forces and institutions of power from the United States and Western and Central Europe to North Africa and various parts of Asia were bound to react violently. The reaction took countless forms. As I show in an upcoming book titled Fascism or Whatever You Want to Call It, if there is one such form of reactionary ideology and power that can be detected universally, it is fascism. In the 1920s, the British colonial administration and the top Islamic institution in Egypt and Sudan worked together to agitate anti-communist sentiments among ordinary observants of Islam on the basis that communism is atheism (Mousseline and Franco appealed to Catholics on similar bases). Of course, Aryan fascism added the antisemitic element to European fascism. Islamism wholeheartedly embodied the double formula of anti-communist and anti-Jewish impulsion. Like the Nazis, Islamists often portrayed Marxism as a Jewish invention and conspiracy. The Shah used the Islamists against the communists, but before he knew it, the Islamists also sacked him. Naser and Sadat did the same thing, unleashing Islamists to eliminate the Egyptian communists. Sure enough, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood carried out a bloody campaign against the communists and many liberals. Then they assassinated Sadat. The Reagan administration used the mujahedeen against the socialist government in Kabul and the USSR. After taking over Afghanistan, the Mujahedeen gave the United States September 11. Islamists break every deal at a moment that best suits their goal. They make truces and agreements only to break them when doing so is beneficial for themselves and devastating for their partners. As fundamentalists, Islamists borrow their pragmatism and opportunism from the history of religious conflicts and conquests. They take the Islamic scripture as a literal source for social and political guidance while taking inspiration from what the early Muslims (actually or supposedly) did. It is ridiculous to generalize the charge of militarism and fanaticism on the hundreds of millions of Muslim believers in today’s world. It is equally absurd to romanticize the institution of religion or perceive religious war as a form of resistance. The Islamists in Syria might go through the motions of staging some sort of elections, but al-Jolani, who is a recent graduate of the Turkish school of Islamism and an alumnus of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, will call the shots and soon will become the little caliph of Damascus. In the broader picture, he will function like the neo-Ottoman Wali of Syria. As soon as another opportunity presents itself, the Islamists will seize it to try to finish what Hamas has tried and failed to accomplish. Like Hamas and other Islamist forces, they exploit the hopelessness of many Palestinians and others to gain popular sympathy, but, also like every other Islamist force, the last thing they care about is people’s lives. To Islamists, people, especially perceived Muslims, are nothing but cheap tools of war. Islamism is, by far, the most dangerous movement in the world. If they had the means to kill millions of people indiscriminately, they would kill millions of people indiscriminately. The French colonial army notoriously violated the human rights of Algerians on a massive scale. The Algerian Islamists in the 1990s went much further than that. To them, Algerians were mere war material. That is the same mentality among all Islamists. To Hamas, for example, the Gazans are not even hostages. From Hamas’s perspective, the Gazans are more like walls, sandbags, or whatever objects that exist in abundance to be used as tools in the holy war, so their talk about resistance and anti-colonial struggle is purely for fooling foreigners, especially the falsely called left in the West. As I show in a book titled Fascism in the Middle East, from the perspective of leftism in the Middle East, Islamism is fascism, period. Islamism is an international problem, but it is first and foremost a problem for perceived Muslim societies. Islamism has indeed been confronted in all those societies, but there have always been powerful states and groups from the Middle East and beyond that devoted huge resources and immense capital to support Islamism making the anti-Islamist struggle in the region extremely difficult. Following the fall of the Iraqi Baath regime, Iraqis at large, who had already been brutalized, became victims of the conflict between Shia Islamism the imperial capital of which is Tehran, and Sunni Islamism, the imperial capital of which is Ankara. Syrians at large have also become victims of the conflict between these two imperial forces. Today, Iraq is a failed state that is run from Tehran. Post-Baath Syria is on its way to becoming a failed state to be run from Ankara. Iraq has become a hub for producing Shia jihadis at the service of their masters in Tehran. From now on, Syria will become an even larger center for producing Sunni Islamists and neo-Ottoman janissaries. Thus far, the so-called international community is content to play along letting the first Al-Qaeda-led state press its teeth deep into the Syrian society crushing what is left of their political aspirations for ages to come. With Islamism, any talk of accommodation and hope for a peaceful political arrangement is mere self-deception. Engaging with the Islamists is suicidal for all. They want to give the impression that they have become moderate, tolerant, and so on. It is absurd for the rest of the world to fall for the same Islamist trick over and over again. The moment the Islamists secure the institutions and borders, a season in hell will start for everyone, including those who are euphorically dancing on the streets of Damascus today. It is doubtful that non-Islamist leaders are so naïve as to believe Erdogan and the new Islamist rulers of Damascus. They only pretend to be so naïve as if the deliberate ignorance provides a moral passage. Many Syrians already realize that the coming state in Syria will not be any less brutal than the Baath state, but as usual, elites who dominate the social institutions of power act in the name of an entire population while elites from other countries act as if that is the case because the premises of the plane of performance are assumed globally.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40gXdm8_Utfka	2025-02-10T16:43:39-08:00	
Will The Federal Reserve Blame Tariffs For The Price Inflation Th...	By Daniel Lacalle Price inflation is rising, but it has nothing to do with tariffs. It has everything to do with the Fed’s policy and the Treasury’s uncontrolled spending. The Core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.2 percent this month and remains stubbornly high at 2.8 percent annualized. The headline PCE Price Index increased by 0.3 percent, the first 0.3 percent monthly increase in eight months. This has pushed the annualized increase to 2.55 percent, the highest in seven months. Obviously, this price inflation trend has nothing to do with tariffs but with the fact that government spending soared 10 percent in 2024, and money supply growth is at a two-year-high. The Federal Reserve created price inflation in 2020 when money supply growth rose at its fastest pace in decades to finance the enormous increase in government spending and perpetuated inflation, keeping an ultra-loose policy for two more years. Furthermore, in 2024 the Fed panicked and delayed its balance sheet reduction in June only to cut rates in September. All these measures, designed to hide the increasing unsustainability of government spending, have perpetuated inflation, reaching an accumulative inflation measured by CPI of almost 25 percent in four years. The M2 money supply saw an unprecedented increase in 2020, with a year-over-year growth rate hitting over 23 percent by August 2020. This was the highest growth rate since records began in 1981. From February 2020 to November 2024, the United States M2 money supply has soared from $15.4 trillion to $21.45 trillion, which is a cumulative growth of about 39.3 percent. In the same period, cumulative price inflation measured by CPI rose almost 25 percent, with some essential goods like gas or food rising more than 40 percent. The entire inflationary spiral is caused by the historic accumulation of newly created money looking to finance the rising excess in government spending, which stood more than $2 trillion above the 2019 level by 2024. Tariffs may have plenty of consequences, but they do not cause price inflation. Price inflation is the erosion of the currency’s purchasing power, and it can only occur when money supply growth, almost always driven by much higher spending, exceeds private sector demand. Furthermore, there has never been an instance in history in which the money supply did not soar alongside government spending. Tariffs may lead to increases in some individual prices if the goods affected are entirely produced abroad and demand is inelastic, but they do not increase aggregate prices, let alone create an annualized and constant increase, as measured by CPI. Only aggressive fiscal and monetary policies cause inflation. Furthermore, if the quantity of money in the system remains unchanged, tariffs would make prices drop because the units of currency available to purchase the rest of the goods and services would be significantly smaller. Tariffs, like oil prices, may have relevant implications on numerous trade factors, but they do not cause price inflation. If the money supply is unchanged and oil prices rise, the rest of the goods and services decline. Same with tariffs. Oil prices and tariffs are inherently deflationary unless newly created currency and money supply growth rise faster. Furthermore, oil and tariffs may have an impact in the short term, but they do not make aggregate prices go up, consolidate the increase, and continue rising, which is what annualized CPI and PCE measure. Why is this important? Keynesians want to continue imposing inflationism and blaming external factors for the erosion of the purchasing power of the currency. This week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) talked about the possible implications of tariffs but refrained from making definitive statements on their immediate impact on interest rates. Jerome Powell highlighted a 'very, very wide range of possibilities' regarding the consequences of tariffs, indicating that the Fed is waiting to see what policies are enacted before assessing their impact on the economy. Powell emphasized that they need to see more data to evaluate how tariffs will affect consumers and the broader economic landscape, according to the FOMC minutes. Thus, the narrative has already been created. If inflation continues to rise, the Federal Reserve will use the tariff excuse just as it used the 'supply chain disruption' and 're-opening' fallacy in the past. However, the reality remains that an abrupt money surge always creates inflation, and the Fed is not fulfilling its mandate. The excuse has been created. Governments will continue to spend and increase deficits and debt, central banks will continue to print, and they will blame tariffs just as they blamed supply chain disruptions. The most important objective of Keynesians is to make you think that the consequences of inflation are the causes. Only rising money supply driven by soaring government spending, which makes money velocity increase, creates inflation.

Trump Talks The Talk With Iran, But Needs To Walk The Walk – OpEd	Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, made a memorable speech to the stormy Labour Party annual conference in 2016, while per forma congratulating Jeremy Corbyn for winning the leadership election with an increased mandate but remaining sceptical that the party would be 'trusted to govern again'. He began the speech saying: 'Labour in power. Not just talking the talk, but walking the walk too. Never sacrificing or selling out on our ideals, but putting them in action every single day.' Khan forecast that Corbyn was 'extremely unlikely' to lead Labour back into No 10. He proved right. A whiff of wariness bordering on pessimism about the prospect of reaching an enduring nuclear deal with the US permeated the remarks by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on February 7 in Tehran in an address to the top military officials. It was an unusual speech, coming just three days after the US president Donald Trump signed the National Security Presidential Memorandum imposing 'maximum pressure' on Iran to deny it 'all paths to a nuclear weapon' on February 4. (See my blog Trump revives ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran but adds a message on US-Iran deal, Indian Punchline, Feb. 7, 2025) Succinctly put, the Supreme Leader made the following observations: A nuclear deal per se is not panacea for Iran’s problems. The JCPOA experience shows the US cannot be trusted. While President Barack Obama didn’t follow up that 2015 deal, President Donald Trump simply tore it up. In retrospect, all the negotiations and all the concessions and compromises that Iran made turned out to be futile. Negotiating with the US, therefore, is neither a wise nor intelligent thing to do or even an honourable thing. Indeed, there is no substantive change in the US attitude toward Iran since 2015 when the Obama administration negotiated the JCPOA. Therefore, Khamenei’s remarks principally addressed the polarised domestic public opinion within Iran regarding the efficacy and purpose of renewed negotiations with the US, and implicitly urged national unity. This is the main thing. As for the future course of action, it is for the government to decide. President Masoud Pezeshkian who has prided himself on being a follower of the Leader since his time as lawmaker, is yet to react to Trump’s stated willingness to meet him. Instead he echoed Khamenei’s sentiments tangentially: 'We and our children are capable of creating a better future with what we have. We just need to believe in ourself and realise that we can. When we develop a deep and long-term vision, we can achieve and undertake the actions we desire.' The government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani also took a tangential line in her post on X that the government will do its best to abide by the Leader’s directive and resonate a unified voice from Iran. 'While everyone is aware of the problems, today we need more unity and solidarity than yesterday to overcome these issues', she wrote, adding at the same time, 'Negotiations with European countries will continue, and everyone knows well that Iran will not engage in negotiations if they are dishonourable.' Interestingly, Mohajerani also avoided making any direct reference to the Trump administration. Evidently, the elites in Tehran are circling the wagons in anticipation of negotiations. Iran’s hardline Majlis Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf too affirmed Ayatollah Khamenei’s stance, asking his colleagues in the legislative body and other government branches to refrain from creating divisions. 'There should not be any duality here. The nature of the Leader’s remarks was firm, definitive, and different from the past.' [Emphasis added.] The bottom line is that the diplomatic track led by the astute former career diplomat and ambassador, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi (a former IRGC official, by the way), is what needs to be watched closely. Araghchi is a veteran nuclear negotiator himself who had a key role in the talks leading to the JCPOA when he was Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister during the administration of Hassan Rouhani.. What is most striking is that there is remarkable consistency in what Araghchi had said in a recent Sky News in an interview with its International Editor Dominic Waghorn some ten days ago and what he said today, two days after Khamenei spoke. Indeed, the interview was conducted in the foreign ministry building in Tehran — an unusual gesture extended to a western editor. Waghorn is been one of the most experienced foreign correspondents in the West today, leading coverage in China, the Middle East and the US, who has interviewed Trump amongst other world leaders. When Waghorn drew Araghchi’s attention to Trump’s recent hints that he would prefer a diplomatic solution — even saying a new deal with Iran would be 'nice' — the top Iranian diplomat stated that although he was prepared to listen to the US President, it would take a lot more than that for Iran to be convinced it should begin negotiations for a new deal. As he put it, 'The situation is different and much more difficult than the previous time. Lots of things should be done by the other side to buy our confidence… We haven’t heard anything but the ‘nice’ word, and this is obviously not enough.' In sum, there is a trust deficit which first needs to be overcome and that initiative has to come from the White House. Nice words cannot be the basis of serious negotiations between to intractable adversaries. Waghorn himself had commented, 'Iranians we spoke to on the streets of Tehran said they hoped a deal could be done with the West if it could lead to a lifting of sanctions and an improvement in Iran’s dire economic fortunes… Trust between Iran and America is also at rock bottom levels. Making progress towards any agreement and lifting sanctions will be enormously challenging.' Now, fast forward. On Saturday evening in Tehran, the day after Khamenei spoke, Araghchi underscored, while addressing a gathering that included top officials and members of parliament, that the US sanctions currently in place against the Iranian people are 'cruel', and they are a big obstacle in the way of Iran’s economic development, which needs to be lifted, but that has to be through negotiations and not the 'maximum pressure' policies announced by Trump in his presidential memo on February 7. Araghchi said there are two tasks to be accomplished. The first one is to lift the sanctions through 'negotiations and interaction with others.' The second one is to 'nullify' the negative impact of the sanctions, which requires self-reliance, and is 'prioritised' by the government and is also being regarded as a public duty. Araghchi stressed: 'Lifting the sanctions requires negotiations, but not under the maximum pressure policy. Negotiation cannot be carried out from a weak stance, as it will no longer be considered negotiation, but will be a kind of surrender. We never go to the negotiating table this way.' That is to say, negotiations with the US and the advancement of Iran’s agenda of 'self-reliance' to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions are not mutually exclusive or is not a binary issue, as some observers of Khamenei’s remarks might misconstrue, but can be mutually reinforcing. However, the big question remains: Is Trump who is walking the talk, also willing to walk the walk? It needs a subtlety of mind and creative thinking to do that. The crux of the matter is that the Trump administration is packed with one-dimensional men — hawks and super hawks on Iran.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40rV24nRVy7hK	2025-02-10T16:38:02-08:00	
Signs That President Donald Trump Is Preparing For War On Mexico ...	Will Donald Trump’s presidency bring a United States war on Mexico? There are indications that it may. In November of 2019, nearly three years into his first term as US president, Trump was declaring his desire for the US military to attack in Mexico. Trump expressed his desire to, with the approval of Mexico’s president, 'wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.' But, this action did not materialize as Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was not accommodating to the idea and Trump became focused on his own reelection campaign. When then out of office for four years, Trump appeared not to relent on his desire for war on cartels in Mexico. Indeed, the expression of this desire made it into his hour-long November 15, 2022 speech at Mar-a-Lago in Florida in which Trump revealed his presidential agenda for a return to the White House. 'We will wage war upon the cartels and stop the fentanyl and deadly drugs from killing 200,000 Americans per year,' declared Trump. On this issue, Trump was not an outlier in the Republican presidential primary. Most other prominent candidates in the primary were also beating the drum for a US war on Mexico. In the first few weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump and his administration have been taking steps that appear to be on course toward a US war on Mexio. Upon being sworn into office on January 20 with Republican majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, Trump wasted no time in setting up prerequisites for a US war on Mexico. That day, he signed his 'Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States' executive order. Cartels, along with 'criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans' were identified in the executive order as having overrun the US-Mexico border and contributed to the situation where 'America’s sovereignty is under attack.' In the executive order, Trump called for literal militarization of the US-Mexico border, stating that 'it is necessary for the Armed Forces to take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full operational control of the southern border.' (The border was already 'militarized' in a more general sense given that, working with the border-industrial complex, the US government has been long operating heavy-handed control at the border and for many miles with the border largely immune from liberty-protecting restraints applicable elsewhere in America.) Trump proceeded to declare in the executive order that 'a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States' that 'requires use of the Armed Forces.' Moving into the particulars, Trump declared: 'The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Armed Forces, including the Ready Reserve and the National Guard, as the Secretary of Defense determines to be appropriate to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.' Pursuant to Trump’s executive order, Lolita C. Baldor reportedFriday at the Associated Press that 1,600 active duty troops have already been deployed to the border, with that number so far set to rise to about 3,600. Also on his first day back in the presidency, Trump issued another executive order related to potential US war on Mexico. That executive order titled 'Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists' appears to lay the foundation for Trump to take military action in Mexico as part of the US government’s ongoing global war on terror. (For people who thought the global war on terror was a thing of the past, Trump demonstrated otherwise on February 1 when he announced the conducting, at his direction, of 'precision Military air strikes on the Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led in Somalia.') The stated purpose of this second executive order is to create a process to designate certain international cartels and other organizations as terrorists and terrorist organizations — designations that the executive branch can then use to justify the US attacking them. 'International cartels constitute a national-security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime,' asserts the executive order, pointing to reasons, among others, that international cartels have 'destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.' Other offered reasons make reference to Mexico in relation to the cartels, stating, '[i]n certain portions of Mexico, they function as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society' and '[t]heir activities, proximity to, and incursions into the physical territory of the United States pose an unacceptable national security risk to the United States.' Looking at these reasons, it seems the executive order is angling to support US military action in Mexico irrespective of any opposition from the governments of Mexico or any parts of the nation. Making clear that the terrorist designation is intended to set the course for major action by the US government abroad, the executive order further states the following: 'It is the policy of the United States to ensure the total elimination of these organizations’ presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States through their extraterritorial command-and-control structures, thereby protecting the American people and the territorial integrity of the United States.' That a US war on Mexico, and maybe other countries where cartels are present, is on the horizon is also suggested by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth repeatedly stating that 'all options are on the table' in regard to countering cartels that he, echoing the language of Trump’s executive orders, labels as both terrorist and threats to America. 'All options on the table' is the long-used DC talk for the US is preparing to sic the military on or otherwise take violent action against a referenced country, group, or individual. 'And as I mentioned to the cartels, all options are on the table,' statedHegseth at a Monday press conference in El Paso, Texas. He later in the press conference repeated his 'all options are on the table' phrasing in answer to a question of if there are 'current plans for any of the troops stationed along the US border to enter Mexico.' This is not a one-off comment. The week before, Hegseth said 'all options will be on the table' in a Fox News interview when asked if the US military may 'go after' cartels 'in Mexico or wherever they are.' Mexican-American War II may be around the corner.

Modi’s Visit To US: Thorny Issues Await Decisions – Analysis	India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in the US on February 12 and 13 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be visiting the United States from February 12 to 13 at the invitation of US President Donald Trump. The visit is very important in as much as it has to address certain key issues which will define India's place in the world in the Trump era that is marked by unpredictability, brash decisions and an unabashed and an unrestrained pursuit of the US interest as defined by him. In this first term as President, Trump was not as transactional and aggressive as he is now, in his second term. Today, words of high praise could well be a prelude to a hard knock. The Indian Prime Minister has to pursue his national interest in an unfamiliar context. It calls for both firmness and flexibility. Some thorny issues await decisions. Initially, Indians were shocked when Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to his inauguration in January leaving out Modi. The Indian media reported that External Affairs Minister S.Jaishankar had camped in Washington for days to wangle an invitation for Modi. He did not succeed, but Trump did the next best thing – he invited Modi to visit him in February. Indians were mollified. But Trump's subsequent tornado of decisions on illegal migrants and tariffs upset the India-US apple cart and cast a shadow on Modi's visit. India has three main concerns now vis-à-vis the US: illegal immigrants, threatened tariffs and the US-India Defence Act Illegal Immigrants India has three main concerns now vis-à-vis the US: illegal immigrants, threatened tariffs and the US-India Defence Act. The most immediate, from the Indian domestic point of view, is the high-handed and almost inhuman way in which illegal Indian immigrants have been deported, chained, shackled and bundled into a US military aircraft. These had indulged in an illegality by entering the US clandestinely, but are not hardened criminals to be chained throughout a 40-hour journey to India. New Delhi, played down the episode first, but soon agreed to take up the matter with the Trump Administration. If Trump were to order a stop to such treatment and assure that the 478 remaining illegal immigrants (or 170,000 according to US estimates) will be treated with some dignity, it will go a long way towards creating a favourable climate for growing US-India relations. Persistence with harshness on the part of the US will be fodder for the forces of ultra-Indian nationalism that will harm US interest too. Hike in Tariffs The second key issue Modi will have to raise with Trump is his threat to impose killing tariffs on Indian products. India's exports, especially in IT and pharmaceuticals could face the heat. Trump had described as a 'Tariff King'. India was excluded from Trump's first wave of tariffs attacks that targeted Mexico, Canada, and China. But high tariffs on Indian exports are very much on the cards. Trump's recent threat to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS nations, including India, should they undermine the US dollar, had worked. India has stated clearly that it would stick to the dollar, distancing itself from its BRICS brethren. Trump's other aim is to narrow trade imbalances such as those which the US has with China and India. India's merchandise exports to the US account for over 18% of its total exports. In 2024, India-US bilateral trade amounted to U$ 118.2 billion. India's exports to the US were $77.5 billion, while the US exported $40.7 billion to India resulting in a US$ 36 billon surplus for India. India's exports to the US primarily consist of petroleum products, pharmaceuticals, telecom instruments, and electronic components. India's imports from the US include petroleum crude, pearls, precious stones, electrical machinery, aircraft parts, and military equipment. Defence equipment imports from the US is to grow as India moves away from Russia in search of sophisticated weapons. However, buying more from the US would depend on the commercial terms offered by US companies, particularly in the energy/petroleum sector. The US would like India to import more of US consumer goods or allow US investments in the retail sector. But Indian traders will resist that. In the past, in response to US tariffs hikes, India had imposed counter-tariffs. But the question is: Can this be done now, in the aggressive Trump era? Pending US-India Defence Bill The third area that Modi could take with Trump may not be of immediate importance, but is critical for its security and its geopolitical interest in the middle and the long run. India needs a firm defence pact with the US to keep China at bay and meet the threat from terrorists based in Pakistan. The growing rapprochement between post-Hasina Bangladesh and Pakistan is also worrying New Delhi because an anti-Indian Bangladesh could well become a cockpit for Pakistani intrigues to destabilize the sensitive North Eastern States of India. In July 2024, when the present Secretary of State Marco Rubio was a Senator, he had presented a bill that was after India's heart – the 'United States-India Defence Cooperation Act'. The Act is yet to be passed. It is very likely that Modi will urge Rubio and Trump to pass it to seal the India-US defence relationship. But Trump will demand reciprocal commitments from Modi on America's defence interests vis-vis-vis China. India will have to be cautious, as traditionally, it has been non-aligned and is not eager to go for a hot war with China, whose economy is five times India's. But Rubio's bill is attractive. Bill's Provisions The bill's Statement of policy, says that it aims to (1) support India in its response to growing threats to its internationally recognized land and maritime borders; 2) provide necessary security assistance to India to deter actions by foreign actors that violate India's land and maritime borders, as recognized by the US; and 3) cooperate with India with respect to defence, civil space, technology, medicine, and economic investments. The US will grant to India, exception for 'sanctionable' transactions under section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. (CAATSA). The sanctions imposed shall not apply with respect to a foreign person or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state for transactions concerning capabilities currently in use by the armed forces of India. The US Congress will offer expeditious consideration of certifications of letters of offer to sell defence articles, defence services, design and construction services, and major defence equipment to India. Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State is authorized to enter into a MOU with India to increase military cooperation, including joint military exercises, personnel exchanges, support for international peacekeeping missions, and enhanced strategic dialogue. During each of the fiscal years 2025 through 2027, the delivery of excess defence articles to India shall be given the same priority as the priority given to other countries and regions under section 516(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j(c)(2)). There will be authorization of appropriations of US$ 2,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2025 through 2027, which shall be used to provide the international military education and training assistance for India. Pakistan Factor The bill says that if the Secretary of State determines in his report that Pakistan is providing assistance to militants in Jammu and Kashmir or is taking other offensive uses of force against India, no security assistance under this Act or under any other Act may be provided to Pakistan until after the submission of a subsequent report. Pakistan will have to dismantle supplier networks relating to the acquisition of nuclear weapons-related materials. It has to combat terrorist groups that have conducted attacks against the US or coalition forces in Afghanistan, or against the territory or people of neighbouring countries. It should prevent al Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State, and associated terrorist groups and offshoots, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, from operating in the territory of Pakistan, including carrying out cross-border attacks into neighbouring countries. Pakistan should close terrorist camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), dismantle terrorist bases of operations in other parts of the country, including Quetta and Muridke, and take action when provided with intelligence about high-level terrorist targets. It is not clear if Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar sought further action on the bill in the Congress when he met Marco Rubio after the inauguration of President Trump on January 20. In its statements on the talks with Jaishankar, the US did not mention the bill, preferring to lay stress on curbing illegal immigration from India. An American decision on the bill will now await President Trump's policies on India, the Indian subcontinent and China. Trump may have his own way of looking at India, and developments in Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. He is the final authority on all matters.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40qMTleGTS53v	2025-02-10T16:33:37-08:00	
India: Maoists Outgunned In Chhattisgarh – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On February 9, 2025, inflicting significant losses on the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), a joint team of Security Forces (SFs) comprising District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Special Task Force (STF) personnel, shot dead at least 31 Maoists in an encounter in a forest area between the Maddeda-Farsegarh border in the Indravati National Park area in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. Two security personnel, one belonging to the state police's DRG and the other from the STF, were killed in the gunfight, and another two suffered injuries. Acting on specific information about the presence of armed Maoists in the National Park area of the district, the SFs initiated an anti-Maoist operation. The recovered bodies of the cadres of Left-Wing Extremists (LWEs) are yet to be identified. A large cache of weapons, including AK-47s, Self-Loading Rifles (SLRs), INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifles, .303 rifles, Barrel Grenade Launchers (BGLs), and explosives were recovered from the encounter site. 'Based on specific information about the presence of armed Maoists at the national park region of Bijapur district, a joint team of security forces comprising DRG and STF left on an anti-Maoist operation on Saturday [February 8],' an unnamed police officer disclosed, adding further that the casualty count of the red rebels may rise further. The February 9, 2025, encounter is the 'most successful' in the state, in terms of fatalities inflicted on the Maoists, since the encounter on October 4, 2024, when 38 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed by the Chhattisgarh Police personnel belonging to the DRG and STF, in the forested terrain near Nendur-Thulthuli in the south Abujhmadh area under Orchha Police Station limits in Narayanpur. In the interim, there have been another 10 encounters which have resulted in three or more Maoist killings in the state. These included: February 1, 2025: eight Maoist cadres were killed by SFs in an anti-Maoist operation in the densely forested Todka area under Gangaloor Police Station limits in Bijapur District. January 20, 2025: at least 16 Maoist cadres were killed along the Chhattisgarh-Odisha border in an anti-Maoist operation conducted in the Kularighat Reserve Forest area under Mainpur Police Station limits in the Gariabandh District. January 16, 2025: at least 18 Maoist cadres were killed by a joint team of security personnel of the DRG from three districts (Bijapur, Dantewada, and Sukma), five battalions of CoBRA [Commando Battalion for Resolute Action, an elite jungle warfare unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)], and the 229th battalion of CRPF, in Bijapur District. January 12, 2025: at least five Maoist cadres, including two women cadres, were killed in an encounter with SFs in a forest in the Indravati National Park area in Bijapur District. January 9, 2025: SFs killed three wanted Maoists in an encounter in the hilly terrain between the Paliguda and Gundarajgudem villages in Sukma District. January 5, 2025: five Maoist cadres in uniform and one SF trooper were killed during an encounter in the Abujhmadh area of Narayanpur District. December 12, 2024: at least seven Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with the SFs comprising DRG, STF and CRPF, in the Abujhmadh forests of Narayanpur District. November 22, 2024: at least 10 Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with SFs in the jungles of Korajuguda, Dantewada, Nagaram, and Bhandarpadar in Sukma District. November 16, 2024: five Maoist cadres were killed during an encounter between the SFs comprising personnel of the DRG, STF, and Border Security Force (BSF), and the Maoists, in the Abujhmadh Forest area of Narayanpur District. November 8, 2024: Three Maoist cadres were killed in an exchange of fire with the SFs near the Rekhapalli-Komathpalli hilly forested terrain in Bijapur District. This series of encounters against the Maoists is part of the 'renewed strategy' to 'end' the Maoist threat by the target date of Marcy 31, 2026, set by Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah. On February 9, 2025, after the operation in Bijapur in which 31 Maoists were killed and a large cache of weapons and explosives was seized, Shah lauded the 'strategic approach' adopted by the Chhattisgarh government and expressed confidence that the goal of a Naxal-free India would be realised by March 31, 2026. Between October 4, 2024, and February 9, 2025, a total of 155 Maoists has been killed in encounters in the Chhattisgarh alone. Another 106 Maoists have been arrested and the mounting pressure has resulted in the surrender of 122 Maoists. On February 1, 2025, hailing the SFs for the growing number of Maoist surrenders taking place in the state and declaring that his government's Naxal [Left Wing Extremism, LWE] policy was based on the principle of 'dialogue for dialogue, bullet for bullet,' Chief Minister (CM) Vishnu Deo Sai stated, My government's Naxal policy is very clear. It is 'Boli ka jawab boli se, goli ka jawab goli se [If you (Naxals) agree to talk, we are ready for a dialogue, otherwise your bullets will be answered with our bullets]. Maoists must shun violence and embrace the democratic path. My government will ensure a good life for the Naxals by undertaking their proper rehabilitation if they surrender. According to a December 20, 2024 report, the Chhattisgarh government launched a new policy aimed at encouraging Naxals to return to the mainstream, showcasing a more compassionate approach to ending the insurgency. Under the new policy, any surrendering Naxalite will be given a monthly allowance of INR 10,000 besides the reward amount that was announced for his/her capture. In addition to financial aid, the government plans to provide land, housing, and resources related to employment to ensure that the surrendered Naxals can lead a stable and productive life. Special training programs will be set up in designated areas to equip them with vocational skills, helping them integrate into society and find sustainable livelihoods. The Maoists have killed 14 SF personnel in five separate attacks during this period. Eight of these fatalities took place in a single attack on January 6, 2025, on the Kutru-Bedre route in the Bastar region in Bijapur District, when Maoist cadres used an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to blow up their vehicle (Scorpio SUV) in which they were returning from an operation. One civilian driver was also killed in the attack. The overall SF:Maoist kill ratio thus works out at 1:12.91 since October 4, 2024. Prior to that date, between March 6, 2000, and October 4, 2024, the ratio was 1:1.26. The Maoists are manifestly outgunned. According to the Annual Report 2023-24, of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), in 2023, Chhattisgarh remained the worst LWE-affected state and accounting for 63 per cent of the total LWE-related incidents of violence and 66 per cent of the resultant fatalities. Jharkhand was the second most affected state, with 27% of the LWE-related violence incidents and 23% of the resultant deaths. The remaining incidents of violence and fatalities were reported from Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Kerala. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Chhattisgarh continued to hold the top spot in terms of fatalities (313 out of a total of 400 nationwide) registered in a state during 2024, with Maharashtra a distant second, with 27 fatalities, and Jharkhand at third, with 26. Chhattisgarh has been at the top spot since 2014. Jharkhand briefly surged ahead in 2013, with 130 fatalities, as compared to 125 in Chhattisgarh. Moreover, violence in the 'Bastar Division,' which remained the major challenge for the state, registered around 97.76 per cent of the overall fatalities in the state (306 fatalities out of a total of 313 statewide). The Bastar Division comprises seven of Chhattisgarh's 33 districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, and Sukma - in the southernmost region of the state. Chhattisgarh has long been the epicentre of Maoist violence in the country and, at peak in 2007, had recorded at least 368 fatalities, including 198 SF personnel, 78 civilians, 74 Maoists, and another 18 in the unspecified category. Since then, however, though the overall fatalities have followed a cyclical trend, the situation has improved. Meanwhile, several efforts have commenced to contain Maoist activities. On February 7, 2025, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) set up a new Company Operative Base (COB) at Kutul in the Abujhmadh region of Narayanpur District. The establishment of the new COB is intended to reduce and control the CPI-Maoist activities in Abujhmadh, and to instil confidence and a sense of security among locals of Narayanpur, Bijapur, and Dantewada. On January 23, 2025, a CPI-Maoist training camp with elaborate infrastructure for training by was captured by the SFs at Bhattiguda village in Bijapur District. The Maoists, who had constructed barrack-like structures at the site, fled before the forces arrived. The training camp was located in the core area of the armed cadres of the Peoples' Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), the Maoists' military wing, belonging to their 'Battalion No-1', in the forested terrain of Bhattiguda. A Shaheed Smarak (martyrs memorial pillar) and concrete structures in the area were also destroyed by the forces at the scene. On January 17, 2025, DRG troops returning from an operation spotted a deep, long and narrow tunnel that the CPI-Maoist used as an easy hideout, and to stockpile arms and ammunition, as well as a staging ground for ambushes in Bijapur District. While the exact dimensions of the Maoist bunker are not immediately known, it was large enough for five or six persons to move around amid a huge dump of explosives, machines, generators and pipes. Videos and photographs of the site show a tunnel, a narrow entry to go below the earth's surface, which widens into the underground lair. The walls were made of packed earth with niches cut into the surface for sunlight and ventilation. A huge dump of Maoist literature, pipes, wires, generators, etc., was recovered from the spot. Bastar Range, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Sundarraj P. disclosed, We have ventured into the Maoists' stronghold of PLGA Company number one and Central Regional Committee [CRC] and now we have started to disturb their facility, which they used to make BGL (Barrel Grenade Launcher) shells, IEDs, which prove detrimental to both security forces and civilians. Such tunnels serve as safe bunkers and are used by Maoists as hideouts during operations, store ammunitions etc. Such bunkers are not unusual for a Maoist stronghold region such as Bijapur, south Bastar and Abujhmadh in Narayanpur districts, which have huge patches with scarce population. It's easy for Maoists to make such a hide-out. Despite substantial improvements in Chhattisgarh's security situation, concerns remain. The state failed to contain civilian fatalities, a key index of security in an area/region. At least six fatalities have already been recorded in this category in the current year (data till February 9, 2025), and 57 civilians were killed in 2024. At peak in 2006, at least 186 civilian fatalities were recorded and, since March 6, 2000, when SATP started documenting LWE-related incidents of killing, there have been at least 1,051 such fatalities in the state. A January 27, 2025, report, indicated that, according to the Chhattisgarh Police, the number of active CPI-Maoist 'politburo' members is down to just: 'general secretary' Namballa Keshava Rao aka Basavaraju (67), Mupalla Laxman Rao aka Ganapathy (75), Mallajula Venugopal Rao aka Sonu (62), and Misir Besra (64), down from 16 in 2004, on account of killings, arrests, surrenders, and deaths due to illnesses. The other key decision-making body of the CPI-Maoist, the 'central committee (CC),' comprises of 11 to 12 active members, down from 32. Apart from the four 'politburo' members, who are also 'CC' members, the Police documents mention Thippari Tirupathi aka Devji (64); Kadari Satyanarayana Reddy aka Kosa (72); Ganesh Uike (60); and Pullari Prasad Rao aka Chandranna (60) as its active living members. Patiram Manjhi aka Anil da, believed to be in hiding in Jharkhand, Modem Balakrishna, and Gajarla Ravi, all 'CC' members, do not figure in the Chhattisgarh Police's list of 'active/alive' top Maoist leaders, for some reason. The second-rung leadership largely comprises members high on guerrilla tactics, mostly hailing from Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, but with limited ideological and strategic vision. The Maoists are fighting a desperate battle in their last strongholds, the final bastion, Chhattisgarh. Retaliatory attacks can be expected in response to the devastating SF operations, as can efforts for a revival. Rebel capacities, however, have been severely degraded, even as their geographical areas of dominance - indeed, even of relative safety - have been progressively circumscribed to narrow areas, principally in Abujhmadh. Even here, a steady advance of SF camps and bases are making movement and operations difficult. The ongoing bloodbath can serve no constructive purpose, and it is high time that both sides consider compromises - not, as is presently the case with state initiatives, in the language of surrender and annihilation, but of negotiation and accommodation.

India: Deadlocked Talks In Nagaland – Analysis	By Afsara Shaheen On January 31, 2025, the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) asserted that, if Indians respect Naga history, the Nagas would reciprocate tenfold. Speaking at the NSCN-IM's 46th Raising Day celebrations, 'vice chairman' Tongmeth Wangnao highlighted two key official recognitions of Naga sovereignty - first in 2002 at an Amsterdam meeting and later in the 2015 Framework Agreement, signed at New Delhi, with the Union Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Wangnao criticized Indian agencies for undermining the Naga political movement, despite 27 years of negotiations. He claimed that, for the past more than 27 years, 'we have been talking with the government of India on the strength of truth behind the Naga political movement. However, it is very unfortunate that the government agencies have indulged themselves in unethical conduct to create many enemies behind the Naga political talks led by NSCN-IM.' The fate of the ongoing Naga political talks, he concluded, rests in God's hands. On January 19, 2025, NSCN-IM accused the Government of India (GoI) of employing deceitful tactics in handling the Indo-Naga political dialogue, which began in 1997. An NSCN-IM statement claimed that the government's 'purposeful falsehood' aimed to mislead the global community about the Naga political issue and identity. The outfit criticized India's alleged repressive and divisive policies, which it said have persisted for over seven decades. The NSCN-IM further highlighted India's use of the term 'terrorist outfit' to describe the organization, despite a 2002 Memorandum of Understanding in Milan, Italy, that lifted the ban under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). It also condemned the prolonged imprisonment of its 'kilonser' (foreign minister) Alemla Jamir, labelling it an act of intimidation against the Nagas. The outfit reiterated its stance against submission, asserting that such tactics undermine the spirit of justice and mutual respect. On November 8, 2024, the NSCN-IM sought a third-party intervention to address the deadlock over the Naga political issue and issued an ultimatum to the Union Government, threatening to 'resume the violent armed resistance against India' if the Centre did not 'honour' the 2015 Framework Agreement signed by the two parties to resolve the Naga political problem. The outfit's 'general secretary' Thuingaleng Muivah claimed the Centre was deliberately refusing to honour the Framework Agreement's key provisions, particularly the recognition of the Naga national flag and constitution. Muivah stated that the Centre's failure to abide by the Framework Agreement could result in resurgence of a renewed violent conflict. Claiming that the Centre has betrayed the essence of the agreement by refusing to formally acknowledge the Naga flag and constitution, Muivah asserted that these were non-negotiable and should be included in any future political settlement, and that failure to respect these commitments would result in the collapse of the peace process. Nagaland has not recorded any insurgency-related fatality in 2025 so far. In 2024, the recorded three such fatalities (one civilian and two militants) in three incidents. The incidents include: June 7: A businessman from Assam, Abdul Kayum Talukdar, was shot dead by suspected militants in the New Market area of Dimapur District, Nagaland. March 4: A cadre of the Ang Mai faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland - Khaplang (NSCN-K) was killed, while another was arrested, following an encounter with the Assam Rifles in the Mon District of Nagaland. February 21: NSCN-IM 'deputy leader', Kilonser Khampei Opeiham Konyak, was shot dead by a group of six unidentified miscreants, at his residence at Tizit in the Mon District of Nagaland. In 2023, Nagaland recorded three fatalities (all militants), all in inter/intra-factional clashes. No fatality was recorded in Nagaland in 2022, while there were four insurgency-linked fatalities (three civilians and one terrorist) in 2021. Since March 6, 2000, when South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) started compiling data, Nagaland has recorded a total of 833 fatalities: 192 civilians, 22 Security Force (SF) personnel, 605 terrorists and 14 in the not-specified (NS) category. Not surprisingly, on September 26, 2024, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) issued a notification under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), extending the purview of the Act has for a further six months in several regions of Nagaland. UMHA stated that the Central Government, after reviewing the security landscape, has re-declared these regions as 'disturbed' to facilitate the operations of the Armed Forces. The extension applies to eight Districts in Nagaland, as well as specific areas falling under designated Police jurisdictions. The Districts in Nagaland include Dimapur, Niuland, Chumoukedima, Mon, Kiphire, Noklak, Phek, and Peren. Specific Police station areas within Kohima, Mokokchung, Longleng, Wokha, and Zunheboto Districts have also been designated as 'disturbed'. This includes Kohima District's Khuzama, Kohima North, Kohima South, Zubza, and Kezocha Police Stations, along with others in neighbouring Districts. The security situation in the state has improved gradually over the years, as overall fatalities, which remained in three digits between 1993 and 2000, dropped to two digits between 2001 and 2015, with the exceptions of 2007 and 2008, when they again touched three digits. However, since 2016, after the signing of the Framework Agreement on August 5, 2015, between the Government of India (GoI) and NSCN-IM, the security situation in the state has registered dramatic improvement, and fatalities have since remained in single digits. There has been one arrest in 2025, so far (data till February 9, 2025), while there were 19 arrests [13 NSCN-K, three NSCN-IM and one each of United Liberation Front of Assam - Independent (ULFA-I), Nikki Sumi-led faction of NSCN (NSCN-K-NS) and Yung Yang faction of the NSCN-Khaplang (NSCN-K-YA)] in 2024 in 11 separate incidents. These were in addition to 36 arrests in 17 incidents in 2023: 19 NSCN-IM, 10 NSCN-K-NS, three NSCN-K-YA, two NSCN-K and one each of the Khango Konyak led faction of NSCN-K (NSCN-K2) and NSCN-Reformation (NSCN-R). There were three arrests [two NSCN-Unification (NSCN-U), and one NSCN-K2-Issac] in two separate incidents in 2022. Nagaland recorded five surrenders in 2024 [four Naga National Council-Non Accordist (NNC-NA) and one NSCN-K]. In 2023, there were 14 surrenders in five separate incidents [Kamatpur Liberation Organisation (KLO), nine; NSCN-K, three and NSCN-U, two]. Interestingly, while signing the Framework Agreement and on several occasions thereafter, GoI has reiterated that the Naga issue would be resolved 'soon'. Significantly on February 7, 2025, 21 Members of Parliament (MP) from various political parties urged Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah to provide a detailed update in Parliament on the stalled Naga peace process and appoint a full-time interlocutor to revive negotiations. In a joint letter addressed to Shah, the MPs called for immediate government action, warning that the stagnation in talks could 'threaten to erode nearly three decades of painstaking progress.' The letter expressed concerns over the lack of transparency and momentum in the peace process. Earlier, on February 20, 2023, Amit Shah had reiterated, 'Our aim is to make peace talks successful and solve Naga political problem quickly.' The talks, nevertheless, drag on as, on the one hand, the NSCN-IM remains fixed on its demand for a separate flag and constitution and, on the other, the Union Government remains non-committal on these two demands. Nevertheless, in pursuit of the goal of long-lasting peace in the areas impacted by the Naga insurgency, GoI has extended ceasefire agreements with a number of Naga insurgent groups, in continuance with the peace talks. For instance, on September 8, 2024, in a significant move aimed at fostering peace and stability in Nagaland, the Government of India (GoI) and the NSCN-K-NS mutually agreed to extend the ceasefire agreement for another year. Even though Nagaland's security situation has improved, a number of issues persist. The GoI has consistently reaffirmed its commitment to resolving the Naga issue since the signing of the Framework Agreement in 2015. However, despite repeated assurances that a solution would be reached 'soon,' the issue remains unresolved. This prolonged delay raises concerns about the sincerity of political commitments, the complexities of negotiations, and the challenges posed by differing perspectives among stakeholders. A critical analysis of the situation highlights several key factors. First, while the Framework Agreement marked a significant step towards peace, the lack of transparency regarding its contents has led to speculation and mistrust among various Naga factions and the broader public. The absence of a clearly defined roadmap has fuelled uncertainty and scepticism. Second, internal divisions within Naga political groups, particularly between NSCN-IM and other Naga factions, have further complicated the peace process. Divergent demands, especially regarding a separate Naga constitution and flag, have stalled negotiations. In sum, while the Framework Agreement was a historic step, the lack of implementation underscores the difficulties of resolving long-standing ethnic and political conflicts. Moving forward, genuine dialogue, mutual trust, and flexibility on both sides will be crucial to achieving a lasting and inclusive settlement that respects Naga aspirations, while maintaining India's territorial integrity. Without a sincere and time-bound resolution, the risk of renewed instability remains a persistent concern.

Romanian President Announces Resignation	By Catalina Mihai (EurActiv) -- Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation as Romania's president on Monday amid growing discontent among the population and even among his own political allies. 'To spare Romania and its citizens from this crisis, from this unnecessary and negative development, I am resigning from the office of President of Romania. I will leave office the day after tomorrow, on 12 February,' said Iohannis. When it annulled the first round of the presidential election in December, the Constitutional Court ruled that Iohannis could remain in office until a successor was elected. But many experts questioned the decision, saying Romania's constitution does not contain clear provisions on the extension of presidential terms beyond five years. Extremist parties that formed in parliament after the parliamentary election on 1 December have repeatedly called on Iohannis to resign. POT, a newly formed extremist party that supported the pro-Russian candidate Călin Georgescu, has twice failed to secure enough votes to pass a motion to suspend the president. With the support of 26 MPs from the pro-European USR (Renew) party, the third attempt was successful. 'It is a pointless endeavour because, in any case, I will be leaving office in a few months after the election of the new president. It is an unfounded endeavour because I have never - I repeat, never - violated the Constitution. And it is a harmful endeavour because, in the end, everyone loses, and no one wins,' Iohannis said, referring to the suspension procedure. 'On the international stage, the effects will be long-lasting and very negative. None of our partners will understand why Romania is dismissing its president after the process of electing a new president has already begun,' he added, saying this will make Romania look like a 'laughing stock'. On Monday, the parliament's governing body decided that the plenary would vote on the president's suspension request on Tuesday. The Constitution provides that in the event of a vacancy, the interim presidency is assumed by the president of the Senate. Since December last year, the Senate has been chaired by PNL President Ilie Bolojan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40raxIlOTlEOC	2025-02-10T16:19:09-08:00	
Trump Talked To Putin About Ukraine War But Details Remain Unclea...	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said he has spoken to Russia's Vladimir Putin and that he believes 'we are making progress' in ending the war in Ukraine, raising fears in Kyiv that it was being sidelined in the process. Speaking to reporters on February 9 aboard Air Force One as he traveled to the Super Bowl, the American football championship game, in New Orleans, Trump confirmed reports he had spoken with Putin, but he declined to specify whether the talks took place before or after he was inaugurated on January 20. 'I've had it. Let's just say I've had it [a conversation with Putin]...And I expect to have many more conversations. We have to get that war ended,' Trump said. 'If we are talking, I don’t want to tell you about the conversations. I do believe we're making progress. We want to stop the Ukraine-Russia war,' he added. He also said his administration was in contact with Ukrainian officials, without being specific. 'We're talking to both sides,' he said. That did little to assuage fears in Kyiv over talks between Moscow and Washington taking place without Ukraine's direct participation. 'It's essential to understand that when we talk about the principle of 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,' we mean that decisions shouldn't be made without Ukraine's participation,' Oleksandr Merezhko, a Ukrainian deputy and the chair of the parliamentary committee on foreign policy and interparliamentary relations, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. 'Putin doesn't want negotiations, and he wants to decide Ukraine's fate without Ukraine's participation. He hopes that the United States and Russia will agree on Ukraine's fate, and Ukraine will become part of Russia's sphere of influence.' The Kremlin on February 10 reiterated its statement from the previous day that it could neither confirm nor deny whether Putin and Trump had spoken. Trump's remarks came ahead of what could be a major week in diplomacy related to the Russia-Ukraine war in which both sides have suffered massive losses since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of February 24, 2022. The lead White House envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference, which opens on February 14. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance is also expected to attend the conference and meet with Zelenskyy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are scheduled to be in Munich. Trump has promised to end the war but has not set out yet in public how he would do so. In an interview published on February 8 by The New York Post, Trump first said he had spoken to Putin, but he did not indicate when the conversation occurred or give further details. Earlier on February 10, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told state media that Moscow had not received any proposals serious enough to warrant talks, without being specific. Trump, meanwhile, said on February 7 that he is likely to meet with Zelenskyy soon as U.S. efforts to end the war gather force. He gave no details, but said the meeting could be held in Washington as 'I'm not going to Kyiv.' Zelenskyy has voiced confidence that Trump can pressure Putin into ending the war. In an interview with British broadcaster ITV on February 7, Zelenskyy said talks between Ukraine and Russia are possible, but only if the West doesn't abandon Kyiv. 'If I had the understanding that America and Europe would not abandon us, and that they would support us and give us security guarantees, then I would be ready for any format of negotiations,' Zelenskyy said. Trump several times has said he was planning to meet with Putin for talks on ending the conflict, although no specifics have been discussed publicly. Hard-line Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, head of the parliament's international affairs committee, was quoted by state media as saying preparations for a Trump-Putin meeting were at 'an advanced stage' and that it could occur in February or March, although the Kremlin has not confirmed the report. Putin has said he was open to discussing a deal with Trump but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insists that Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40tORkGH5jZGe	2025-02-10T16:17:02-08:00	
Starmer Must Stand Up For International Law – OpEd	By Chris Doyle In just three weeks, US President Donald Trump has shaken up the global order, rewritten it even. He has certainly flooded the zone and the world is now watching to see who will sink and who will swim. How much of what Trump has pledged will materialize remains to be seen, but even if these are the opening gambits of a negotiation, they have had allies and enemies reeling. Trump’s push for the US to take over Gaza is perhaps the most jaw-dropping of all, coming not long after his 'clean up' Gaza comments. Few have felt the brunt of this whirlwind more than the UK, which always used to pride itself — to the point of an unhealthy obsession — on its 'special relationship' with Washington. If you want to know what a special relationship with the US really looks and feels like, then check out the grinning Cheshire cat pose of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as Trump proposed ethnically cleansing Gaza. At a leadership level, it is harder to think of a more challenging time for a British prime minister. Keir Starmer is not in the inner circle of Trump’s loyalist core. It took a week after the inauguration for the two to have their first conversation since Trump returned to the Oval Office. Few will read too much into Trump’s statement that the two have a 'very good relationship.' Questions remain as to whether Trump approved of the deluge of posts against Britain — and Starmer in particular — by his ally Elon Musk in recent weeks. He has certainly never distanced himself from them. So, how is Starmer handling this and how will the relationship develop? The reaction to Trump’s Middle East comments is indicative of the direction of travel. Not one British minister has directly criticized Trump’s desire to empty Gaza of its population. The phrase 'ethnic cleansing' will not cross their lips. Starmer dodged a direct question about Trump and Gaza at last week’s Prime Minister’s Questions in Parliament. Without directly criticizing the president, British ministers have outlined a position that is diametrically opposed to Trump’s. 'We would oppose any effort to move Palestinians in Gaza to neighboring Arab states against their will. There must be no forced displacement of Palestinians,' Development Minister Anneliese Dodds said last week. Asked countless times to condemn Trump’s comments, she resisted the temptation. Similarly, as Trump defunds UNRWA, the UK continues to offer verbal and financial support. But what about the International Criminal Court? Again, little has been said despite the fact that the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, is a British national. He will undoubtedly be one of the officials to face US sanctions. One appropriate step that states like the UK could take is to increase funding to the International Criminal Court. More importantly, member states must reiterate their support for the arrest warrants that the court issued for both Israeli and Hamas leaders. There was a joint statement from 79 state parties to the Rome Statute, including the UK, defending the court, which was welcome, but it needs leaders to step up and make such statements personally. As a human rights lawyer, Starmer should be taking that lead. Starmer’s inaction should be embarrassing for a man who only in September, when addressing the UN General Assembly, stated: 'We must stand up for international law.' This rings hollow, as the UK remains complicit in the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza through continuing to sell it parts for F-35 planes. All this is simply caving in to Trump and Netanyahu. Middle East states have led the way in pushing back firmly against the forced expulsion of Palestinians, but London is only following at a distance. The opposition to what Trump has said and done should be clear and explicit. No leader of any state should be proposing ethnic cleansing anywhere. The West Bank and Gaza are for Palestinians, not for Israel and not for the US. Palestinians do not belong in Egypt, Jordan or Saudi Arabia, let alone Morocco, Puntland or Somaliland, which are apparently also being considered. A more appropriate response from European powers would be to make the long overdue decision to recognize the state of Palestine. This is another opportunity for the UK to take the lead, not least given its historical responsibility. Trump feeds off weakness. Those leaders who cave in will not earn his respect. Starmer will have to ensure he stands up for British interests and, just as importantly, for international law and justice. Work on this is required now. It is pointless opposing Trump in isolation. The UK should help coordinate a strong joint international response with European, Middle East and other actors. This would render Trump’s proposals utterly meaningless. British officials claim that Starmer will be going to see Trump within weeks. If so, he must conjure the clarity, conviction and courage to articulate not just a clear opposition to Trump’s proposals on the Middle East, but also alternative, legal ways forward to ensure the Israel-Hamas deal goes forward, that reconstruction happens without forced displacement, and that there is a proper, credible political process to end this conflict. - Chris Doyle is director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding in London.

The Deadlock Of Iran’s Regime And The Power Display Of An Alterna...	The Iranian regime is at its weakest point in 45 years. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is like a gambler who has played all his cards and lost. The collapse of Iran’s strategic influence in Lebanon and Syria, along with the retreat of its forces, led to the downfall of Bashar al-Assad’s government in less than two weeks. This is the result of Khamenei's grand gamble—igniting the Gaza war to divert attention from domestic uprisings. Escalating Executions to Suppress Public Unrest The Iranian regime is increasing executions to curb public dissatisfaction and unrest. According to Amnesty International, 1,000 executions have occurred in 2024 alone. Political prisoners have been on weekly strikes for over a year, demanding an end to executions. Meanwhile, Iranian activists abroad raise global awareness through exhibitions and campaigns. In the UK, the Association of Academics in Exile has organized impactful initiatives across various cities, gaining local media attention and highlighting the regime’s human rights abuses. The Nuclear Crisis and International Pressure Iran’s push for nuclear weapons has heightened global concerns, particularly among major world powers. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Iran has increased uranium enrichment to 90%, the threshold required for nuclear weapons. In response, the European powers—Britain, France, and Germany—warned in December 2024 that they would activate the snapback mechanism, which would restore all international sanctions against Tehran. On February 3, 2025, The New York Post reported: 'The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) has accused Tehran of accelerating its nuclear weapons program, with two facilities rapidly working on completing a warhead capable of traveling more than 1,800 miles.' With the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, the Iranian regime faces significant pressure. Trump intends to reinstate the maximum pressure campaign and force Iran into negotiations. However, Tehran has no leverage left for such negotiations, as these typically involve exchanging concessions. In response to increasing discussions on potential negotiations with the U.S., Khamenei declared on February 7, 2025: 'Negotiating with the United States will not solve any of our country’s problems. We must understand this clearly. They should not make it seem like if we sit at the negotiating table, problems will be resolved. No, absolutely not! Negotiating with the U.S. solves nothing… Negotiating with such a government is neither rational, nor intelligent, nor honorable.' Trump’s Plan to Disarm the regime One of the first actions of Trump’s administration against the Iranian regime was imposing sanctions on an international network that funnels illicit revenue to Iran. Tammy Bruce, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, stated: 'This network was identified for facilitating the transfer of millions of barrels of illegal Iranian oil to China via the front company Sepehr Energy, which finances Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff and supports the regime’s terrorist proxies.' She further emphasized: 'The U.S. is targeting the ships and management companies that transport Iranian oil and contribute to Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region. We will use all available tools to hold this regime accountable for its destabilizing actions and pursuit of nuclear weapons.' A Regime Confronted by a Resilient Opposition While Iran faces international isolation, it is also struggling with deep political, social, and economic crises at home. One of its biggest internal threats is the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK) and its political coalition, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), which has been leading a relentless struggle against the regime for over four decades. The expansion of PMOI/MEK resistance units inside the country has played a key role in organizing uprisings and shaking the regime’s control. Targeted Attack on Notorious Judges In a significant incident, two notorious judges involved in the mass execution of political prisoners were targeted in a planned attack. Regime officials claimed that the attack was carried out by an infiltrator within the judiciary system. This incident sparked celebrations among the victims’ families and widespread fear among regime officials, as they saw their own fate mirrored in the attack. Massive Demonstration in Paris: A Show of Strength by the Iranian Resistance Following last year’s massive opposition demonstration in Berlin, this year’s event in Paris marked an even greater milestone. According to Paris police, the anti-regime demonstration on February 8, 2025, was 'unprecedented and astonishing,' causing major disruptions across the city. This event drew global attention to a well-organized and powerful alternative—one that represents the continuation of Iran’s 1979 revolution, but on a more democratic and grander scale. Agence France-Presse (AFP) published images of the demonstration, which coincided with the anniversary of the 1979 anti-monarchical revolution. The report noted that participants carried portraits of Maryam Rajavi and Massoud Rajavi, while demanding justice, human rights, and freedom for the Iranian people. In a video speech addressing the thousands gathered at Denfert-Rochereau Square in Paris, Maryam Rajavi, leader of the NCRI, declared: 'In the 1979 revolution, our people overthrew the monarchical dictatorship. Now, we have risen to overthrow the theocratic dictatorship and achieve a democratic revolution. This time, we will separate religion from government and ensure all ethnic groups—Kurds, Arabs, Baluchis, Turkmens—will have their full rights recognized.' Is the Regime on the Brink of Collapse? International pressure, domestic uprisings, and the growing power of a well-organized opposition have put the Iranian regime in a state of unprecedented fragility.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40jOv5zAVqVHb	2025-02-10T16:09:50-08:00	
Myanmar: New Military Junta Conscripts Say They’re Being Ordered ...	Conscripts inducted into Myanmar’s military over the last year have been quickly sent to frontline units where they are ordered to torch civilian homes and loot public property, several soldiers who deserted told Radio Free Asia. The accounts come after the junta has conscripted men between 18 and 35 to make up for losses and surrenders by the military in Myanmar’s four-year civil conflict. Pyae Sone, a recent recruit who had fled duty last month and was in hiding, told RFA Burmese that junta officers freely stole food from villagers, slaughtering cattle and ordered soldiers to burn down homes. 'When we entered villages, we took whatever edible food we could find if we had nothing to eat,' he said. 'Since we lacked sufficient supplies, we were ordered to seize food. The junta officers reinforced their motto: ‘Cattle for food, homes for firewood.’' He was first sent to the 105th Infantry Battalion, based in Bago region’s Inn Ta Kaw township, and later to Sagaing region’s Monywa township where the military’s northwestern regional headquarters is located. There were 24 new conscripts in the column, he said. From Monywa, his 30-person column patrolled nearby villages, where soldiers were ordered to kill cattle for food and destroy homes, he said. Ever since Myanmar started drafting young people for the military last year, they have fled the country or looked for other ways to avoid serving. That led to mass arrests by police and military officials in major cities in what some residents described as 'snatch and recruit' operations. About 70 percent of the junta’s forces currently on the front lines are new conscripts, according to people’s defense forces and ethnic armed groups. That percentage was also mentioned by a former military junta officer who spoke to RFA. Another conscript, Ye Lin, said he took part in military operations in Demoso and Loikaw townships in Kayah state where his unit set fire to homes after dousing them with gasoline. The unit had about 300 soldiers, 250 of whom were new conscripts, Ye Lin said. 'Officers ordered us to cut down trees and burn houses to clear the area,' he said. 'They also instructed us to plant landmines for their protection. The houses were set on fire one after another alternately. Brick walls were forcibly broken through.' Ye Lin said he and three other new conscripts fled the unit on Jan. 29. RFA was unable to contact junta spokesman Major Gen. Zaw Min Htun on Monday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40rG9CSRcl7j-	2025-02-10T16:07:16-08:00	
Geopolitical Vision Of The Future: Serbia In The New Global Order...	By Bogoljub J. Karić The world is experiencing tectonic shifts that will define the geopolitical landscape for decades to come. The emergence of a multipolar world, driven by the rise of China, Russia, and other BRICS members, poses a challenge that compels the United States to redefine its strategy for global leadership. President Donald Trump, with his vision of a 'super-state,' is ushering in a new era in which America will seek to preserve its dominance in increasingly complex circumstances. New global challenges and Trump's strategy The global balance of power is undergoing a transformation. BRICS, led by Russia, China, and India, is challenging the Western economic and political order. Despite its enormous potential due to its demographics, natural resources and markets, the alliance suffers from a major shortcoming – the lack of a cohesive military force to safeguard its assets and maintain geopolitical stability. This very weakness presents an opportunity for the United States. President Trump recognised that America’s future lies in the creation of a unified, integrated entity – a super-state that would dominate across all spheres: from the economy and technology to military and geopolitical power. His vision includes integrating Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal into the United States. These territories are not only geographically significant – they are crucial for the strategic and economic power of America’s future: ● Canada provides vast natural resources and a stable economic system.● Greenland, with its strategic location and mineral wealth, opens the gateway to the Arctic and its energy potential.● The Panama Canal, a critical point in global trade, would symbolically and strategically return under US control. Trump’s idea is not merely a momentary vision but a plan that will transform the global order over the next 200 years. A response to BRICS: military power as the cornerstone of stability Unlike the BRICS alliance led by President Putin – widely regarded as the leading architect of a multipolar world, with its undeniable economic strength but lacking a robust military foundation – the American strategy prioritises military dominance. Trump’s vision is based on the principle that a stable economy cannot exist without peace in the world, and global peace is unattainable without the safeguarding presence of formidable military power, or, as he famously states, 'Peace through strength,' meaning that peace can only be preserved if one is strong enough to deter others from launching an attack. While this strategy is not new, it now takes on a new dimension through significant investments in space technologies and emerging forms of warfare. Elon Musk, driven by Tesla’s visionary approach and his projects in the space industry, is emerging as a pivotal figure in this transition. Musk is likely to spearhead the development of space-based military capabilities and advanced satellite systems that will redefine the way global conflicts are waged. Musk’s vision is compellingly articulated in his statement: 'We need to expand the scope and scale of consciousness so that we’re better able to understand the nature of the universe and understand the meaning of life'[2]. I firmly believe that future wars will no longer be fought in forests and fields but through satellites and in outer space. These developments are shaping a new geopolitical reality in which the US aims to retain its status as the dominant power. Serbia and the Balkans – a strategic choice for survival In this context, the crucial question arises: where does Serbia position itself in the new global order? As a small country, Serbia faces the challenge of making a crucial decision about the course of its foreign policy. Neutrality, often presented as an option, can prove dangerous in the long run. The geopolitical reality is clear – the world is dividing into alliances and spheres of influence, and countries that fail to choose a side risk falling into marginalisation, or even disappearance, in the decades to come. Serbia needs to adopt a broader perspective and identify allies that can provide stability, security, and progress. A referendum on the nation’s strategic orientation could prove to be a vital instrument, allowing the Serbian people to determine their future path. Without a clear direction, Serbia risks becoming collateral damage in the global conflicts of interest among major powers. Beyond geopolitical and economic considerations, a return to fundamental values is also essential. Trump’s vision is not solely based on economic and military growth but also on the revival of traditional family values. Family, faith, and community are once again becoming the cornerstones of future civilisation. Serbia, as a country with a rich tradition and Orthodox identity, can find its place within this vision. Conclusion The world is entering a new era where multipolar dynamics clash with the aspirations of individual powers to dominate. The American vision of a 'super-state,' championed by President Trump, aims to ensure global stability through integration and strength. On the other hand, BRICS and other alliances offer an alternative but face limitations that leave them vulnerable to external challenges. For Serbia, this is a critical moment to position itself within the new global order and define its own geopolitical vision for the future. A referendum on its foreign policy course is more than just a present-day issue – it is a matter of survival of future generations. Our responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to choose the right ally and ensure a peaceful and secure future. About the author: Bogoljub J.

Bangladesh: Awami League, Opposition Activists Among Hundreds Swe...	By Zia Chowdhury At least 1,600 people, including scores belonging to Bangladesh’s deposed former ruling party, were swept up in a crackdown launched by authorities over the weekend, court documents show, days after protesters destroyed a museum memorializing the country’s founding father. Home Affairs Adviser Md. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury told journalists that the ongoing operation, dubbed as 'Devil Hunt,' involved the military, police and border guards. 'What does ‘devil’ mean? It refers to evil forces,' he told reporters on Sunday. 'This operation is aimed at those who try to destabilize the country, break the law, engage in criminal activities and commit acts of terrorism.' Last week, officials from the interim government accused former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and supporters of her Awami League party of trying to whip up trouble, when she delivered a speech from India to mark the six-month anniversary of her ouster by a student-led uprising. A huge crowd of people opposed to her 15-year rule then converged on a memorial-museum that honored her late father, and burned and tore it down. Abu Nased Mohammad Khaled, a police official who was coordinating Operation Devil Hunt, declined to disclose the political affiliations of the 1,651 detainees. Still, BenarNews obtained a list of arrestees in the Gazipur Metropolitan Police area, which mentioned about 240 leaders and activists who were identified as Awami League (AL) or affiliated organizations over two days. The list was shared by court officials. In addition, AL Organizing Secretary Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, who is in hiding, said scores of party activists had been arrested. 'They’re trying to save the original devils and in the name of the operation they’re wiping out the Awami League. But history will repeat [itself] – the Awami League will return to its position of power again,' Khalid told BenarNews. In the weeks after Hasina’s government fell, hundreds of officials from her party and its supporters fled and went into hiding. The interim government, which includes students who spearheaded the uprising that toppled Hasina, have been pursuing ex-Awami League officials and charging them in connection with the deaths of hundreds of demonstrators during the July-August protests. In contrast, police have made no arrests linked to the Feb. 5 demonstration that led to the destruction of the memorial museum to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founder and the father of Sheikh Hasina, according to police in Dhanmondi, a neighborhood of Dhaka where the museum stood.Hasina had power over the AL and served as prime minister before student-led protests forced her out of the country last Aug. 5. In late January, the AL announced that members would hold a month-long demonstration in February featuring protest rallies, blockades and a general strike to demand the resignation of interim government chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate. Among events was a Feb. 5 address by Hasina from India, where she has been hiding out since fleeing Bangladesh, to members of the AL student wing. Shortly afterward, student-led protesters set fires to the museum dedicated to her father. The museum was housed in Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s home in Dhaka, where Bangladesh’s founding president was assassinated in a coup in 1975. Different protest Bangladesh authorities announced that a different protest led to the weekend operation – violent attacks and vandalism beginning around 9 p.m. Friday near the Gazipur residence of A.K.M. Mozammel Haque, the former Liberation War Affairs minister. Several people were injured. Student movement leaders tried to stop the attacks they claimed were caused by 'Awami League goons.' Many reiterated calls to ban the AL. On Saturday, Asif Mahmud Shajib Bhuyian, interim government youth and sports adviser, told the state-owned news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) that the government would soon take steps to ban the AL as a political party. 'First of all, it is very positive that political parties have reached a ‘consensus’ on banning the Awami League,' he said. 'We – the common people and political parties – represent the people of this country. Prioritizing their aspirations and demands should be our main goal. 'From that perspective, I would like to applaud the BNP for raising the demand to ban the Awami League,' he said. ‘Innocent’ people arrested G.M. Quader, chairman of the Jatiyo Party, which is perceived as an enabler of Hasina’s government, claimed that false complaints were being filed against leaders and activists from his party. In a written statement on Monday, he called on the interim government to end the persecution and harassment of 'innocent' people. 'Atrocities and persecution are being carried out against the Jatiyo Party, numerous false cases have been filed against the party-men,' he said in the statement. 'They are being arrested and denied bail,' Quader told BenarNews. Human rights activist Abu Ahmed Faijul Kabir questioned the weekend operation and called on the Yunus-led government to not target any specific political party or group. 'The name of the operation is a disrespect for the citizens – every citizen has the right to defend himself or herself by the law,' he told BenarNews. 'Before any verdict takes place, naming someone as ‘devil’ is wrongful.' For his part, Yunus on Monday called for reconciliation since protests began in July 2024 that led to Hasina’s downfall. 'Our country’s future depends on our ability to overcome conflict. We must find a way forward together,' Yunus said, according to a news release of his statement. 'We will not indulge in injustice. Those who break the law will face its consequences. But for those who haven’t, we will tell them that, ‘you have caused me a lot of pain, but I will not do the same for you.’' Meanwhile, the president of Nagorik Oikya political party blamed Yunus’s interim government for the uprisings. 'The interim government should be responsible for the attacks, they were supposed to stop and retaliate against the attacks wherever they occur – but the government did not – it’s absurd,' Mahmudur Rahman Manna told BenarNews.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40n9xSmSumFuT	2025-02-10T16:00:43-08:00	
Trump: Palestinians Won’t Have Right To Return Under His Gaza Pla...	U.S. President Donald Trump says Palestinians living in Gaza now would be moved to an unspecified location outside the territory and have no right to return under his plan for the enclave. Trump, in an interview with Fox News released Monday, called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a 'real estate development for the future.' 'I would own it,' he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected. Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated. But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to return home to Gaza, Trump said, 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing.' 'In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,' Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas, although currently in the middle of a six-week ceasefire. Trump first disclosed his surprising Gaza plan standing alongside visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week. He has suggested that Egypt and Jordan take in the Palestinians but both countries have rejected the idea. In the Fox interview, set to be broadcast Monday after the first half was aired ahead of the Super Bowl pro football championship game Sunday, Trump said he would build 'beautiful communities' for the Palestinians. 'Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. Meanwhile, Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, announced Monday it is indefinitely postponing its next hostage-prisoner exchange, accusing Israel of violating terms of the ceasefire that extends to early March. The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement, the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms 'as long as the occupation adheres to them.' Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned; 'targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas'; and 'failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed,' although 1,260 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza and the United Nations has said the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Since the ceasefire took effect, Hamas has freed 21 hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. Pressure is growing on Israel and Hamas to extend the truce. While on Air Force One on the way to the Super Bowl, Trump told reporters he was losing patience with the situation after seeing emaciated hostages released by Hamas. 'I watched the hostages come back today and they looked like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition. They were emaciated. It looked like many years ago, the Holocaust survivors, and I don’t know how much longer we can take that,' he said. A new benchmark was reached Sunday in the ceasefire in Gaza, with Israeli troops withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by 15 months of fighting. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had 'forced the enemy to submit to our demands' and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu's illusion of achieving total victory.' Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire. But almost no progress has been made in negotiating an extension of the truce, which is supposed to lead to the release of more hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40iB4_QSvAyxX	2025-02-10T15:53:02-08:00	
Dynamics Of Changing The Global Order: Return Of Trump, Greenland...	1. The dynamics of changing the global order The global order has undergone significant changes in recent decades, which have been intensified by specific factors. The emergence of new global powers such as China and India is consolidating their roles as new economic, technological and military superpowers. The competition between the USA and China has reformatted international relations and has fueled trade, political and technological tensions. In these circumstances, the weakening of multilateralism in its essential form is apparent. International organizations such as the UN and NATO have faced challenges in addressing new conflicts and climate change. Also, some countries are trying to minimize their impact on national policies. In this dynamic of political developments, the positioning of neo-fascist movements has taken on worrying proportions. In many countries, populist movements have gained ground, challenging the traditional liberal order. They are in fact more like neo-fascist movements in the guise of populism and extreme nationalism. These movements have influenced global agreements on trade, immigration and international cooperation. Energy crises such as the one caused by the war in Ukraine, and the challenges of the transition to sustainable sources, have created good ground for neo-fascist movements. The emergence of neo-fascism seems to remind us of how little we have learned as Western Civilization from modern history. It seems that Madeleine Albrigt's fear of a possible return in the 1920s and 1930s is true.[1] In the spring of 1974, at a time when Italy was facing neo-fascism, Primo Levi, the Italian writer of Jewish origin and Holocaust survivor, wrote an essay in the pages of Corriere della Sera entitled 'A Past We Thought Would Never Return.' 'Every era has its fascism, and we see the warning signs wherever the concentration of power denies citizens the opportunity and means to express themselves and to act of their own free will. There are many ways to reach this point, and not only through the terror of police intimidation, but by denying and distorting information, undermining justice systems, paralyzing the education system, and spreading in a myriad of subtle ways nostalgia for a world where order reigned and where the security of a privileged few depended on the forced labor and enforced silence of the many.'[2] Is this a past that we believed would never return?! The war in Ukraine and the return of modern fascism on a worrying scale even in a number of Western countries, where democracy was well established, should revive the 'heroes of democracy'[3] throughout Europe and elsewhere, said the German philosopher Dieter Thomae. 1.1 The Return of Donald Trump The return of Donald Trump to the White House, which in the first days is expected to have fundamental consequences not only for democracy in the United States, but for all areas of international relations and cooperation. But 'Trump 2.0' will have a particular impact on the Global South. Consequently, the reorganization of the global economy is in full swing. The prospective conflict with China can now be said to have shaken the geoeconomy. Together with the war in Ukraine, this shaking of the 'tectonic plates' accelerated the establishment of the BRICS. When tectonic plates shift, the earth trembles. Tsunami sends shock waves around the globe. The global economy has experienced a series of earthquakes that are difficult to compare even for large economies, such as Germany, etc. Consequently, researchers in the field [of economics and its trends for 2025] rightly expect that 'the general trend in 2025 will be towards a global recession.'[4] The warning of tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada, which de facto means economic war, is straining transatlantic relations. At an informal meeting in Brussels, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the European Union could 'respond to customs policies with customs policies,' adding that 'we must and will do so.'[5] It is clear that the European Union wants to avoid a trade war with US President Trump, but Brussels does not rule out the possibility of retaliating with customs tariffs. The creation of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and its role in transforming the global order is a topic that has aroused much debate and analysis. The acceleration of the creation of a new world order is often linked to the aspirations of developing countries to review the current economic and political power structures, long dominated by Western countries. The BRICS represent the largest emerging economies, which aim to create a balance to traditional institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, which have historically been dominated by the US and EU countries. The BRICS member countries often emphasize the need for a multipolar world order, where power and decision-making are more widely distributed. BRICS, however, is not simply an economic platform, but also a forum for influencing global issues, from climate change to international security. If BRICS continues to expand and strengthen its structures, it could help create an order where power and resources are distributed more proportionally and equitably between developed and developing countries. However, challenges such as political and economic divergences among member countries could affect the success of this initiative. Like Europe, most Asian countries are dependent on China’s dynamism for their economic development and on US guarantees for their security. This fact is emphasized in particular by German scholars. Therefore, to varying degrees, they resist the pressure to choose a side. However, it remains to be seen whether it will be possible to escape the pull of geoeconomic bipolarization in the long term.[6] Donald Trump has meanwhile won the 2024 presidential election and will be inaugurated again as US president on January 20, 2025. Even before taking office, he managed to impose the agreement between Israel and Hamas for the release of hostages. In the meantime, he has signed a mountain of legal acts that prove that he remains determined to fulfill the promises he made during the campaign. His return to the White House is already showing that it is expected to bring some important changes to the global order: 'America First' foreign policy: Trump has promoted a unilateral approach and minimized the US commitment to traditional alliances such as NATO. His return could strengthen American isolationism. Resuming tough stances towards China: Trump is expected to continue trade and technology policies towards China, deepening the economic divide between the two countries and its global influence. Changing approaches to climate and trade: With a history of withdrawing from agreements like the Paris climate accord, a return to it could set back global efforts to combat climate change. Reshaping international relations: Trump’s approach to strategic partners and adversaries could shift the balance of power, increasing instability in some regions. However, changing the global order is a complex process, driven by multiple forces, and Trump’s return is already showing signs of intensifying these dynamics. While some countries may benefit from a more decentralized and national-interest-based order, others may suffer the consequences of a more fragmented and polarized politics. One thing is certain: global politics will continue to be in transition, and future decisions will have long-term impacts on international stability. 2. Greenland and geopolitical positioning With Donald Trump’s recent statements about the possibility of annexing the island of Greenland and the 'Anschluss' of Canada, the Western Hemisphere is gradually sliding towards a period of recalibration and revision of transatlantic relations. Trump’s presidency will not succeed in breaking the Western alliance on its axis, but it will strain essential relations and cause a kind of stress test for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the relationship, in a broader sense, between the United States and the European Union. In these circumstances, Western strategists are left to develop steps to manage mutual interdependence. Donald Trump’s request to buy Greenland from Denmark was also made in 2019, which sparked an international debate, reflecting the combination of geopolitics, economics and climate issues. Although the idea was immediately rejected by the Danish and Greenlandic authorities, it is of great importance for understanding the changes in the global geopolitical map. On both sides of the Atlantic, it seems that goals, definitions of interests, and value systems are changing so drastically that 'the gap between the United States and Europe […] is likely to widen over time.'[7] President-elect Donald Trump, in his statement, did not rule out the use of military force or economic action to take control of Greenland. 'We need Greenland for national security reasons. I’ve been told that for a long time, long before I ran for president. People really don’t know if Denmark has any legal rights to the island. But if they do, they should give it up because it’s about our national security and for the good of the free world. There are Chinese ships, Russian ships, and we will not allow this to continue,'[8] said President-elect Trump, among other things. The repetition of that idea now almost eighty years ago [December 1946], when the United States was discussing the possibility of purchasing the island of Greenland from Denmark for $100 million in gold – the 'cleanest' solution, as it was called at the time. The logic that preceded this political will may have been completely different eight decades ago, but the strategic judgment in the sphere of economic interests and geopolitical positioning is exactly the same as that of Trump today. 'The money is abundant, Greenland is completely worthless to Denmark, and control of Greenland is essential to the security of the United States,'[9] an internal State Department memorandum stated at the time. With this public statement, Trump is following in the footsteps of Harry Truman. But if former President Truman made the proposal in deep discretion, in secret communication, at a meeting of the foreign ministers of the two countries in New York, Trump does it in his own style. At that time, the American offer was $ 100 million in gold, equivalent to about $ 1.6 billion today. As is known, this offer was only made public when the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten came across historical documents and reported on it 45 years later. US President Donald Trump has caused extraordinary turbulence by publishing the idea of ​​a possible 'Anschluss' of Greenland to the United States of America. 'For the purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world', it is an absolute necessity that Greenland become the property of the United States, Trump wrote in the most pathetic style possible just before Christmas. He reiterated this position in the meantime, not ruling out the use of coercive force, openly threatening Denmark, within whose territorial integrity this Arctic island is. Greenland is geographically part of North America; it was colonized by Denmark in the 18th century and has had an autonomous status since 1979, which was extended in 2009. The territory is rich in natural resources. These include oil, gas, gold, diamonds, uranium, zinc and lead. Greenland is the largest island in the world, and has a strategic location in the Arctic. For the United States, Greenland has strategic military importance due to the Thule Air Base, a center for missile monitoring and defense. As Geoff Dabelko, professor of security and the environment at Ohio University, explains, the world's largest island now occupies a 'central place in geopolitical and geoeconomic competition in many ways',[10] but above all because of the interest expressed by Russia and China in this transport route, which is partly related to climate change. The US interest in Greenland also reflects concerns about the growing presence of Russia and China in the Arctic, as they compete for access to the region's sea lanes and rich resources. The Kremlin recently announced that it is following 'very closely' the 'dramatic' rhetoric of US President Donald Trump, who has threatened to annex Greenland, a larger area of ​​which Russia has taken over the upper part. 'The Arctic is an area of ​​our national interests (…), we are closely following the rather dramatic development of the situation, which, thank God, has so far remained at the level of statements,' said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, adding that Russia wants to maintain peace and stability there.[11] The United States’ reaction to this statement was immediate. The US has no immediate plans to increase its military presence in Greenland, the US embassy in Copenhagen said the same day, after US President-elect Donald Trump renewed his interest in taking control of the Arctic island. Donald Trump’s statement has meanwhile caused a wave of reactions in European capitals as well. The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Kaja Kallas, following Donald Trump’s expansionist ambitions in the Danish territory, said that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Greenland must be respected. 'Greenland is part of Denmark (…) we must respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Greenland,' Kallas stressed within the same timeframe. Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the same day that he was sure that for US President-elect Donald Trump, Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, although he also said that Trump’s rhetoric could be destabilizing. 'We have known since Donald Trump’s first term that the intensity of his rhetoric and sometimes the unpredictability of what he says can be a destabilizing factor,' [12] Lammy told BBC Radio, responding to a question about Trump’s intentions to make Greenland part of the United States. President Donald Trump seems to have no regard for President Theodore Roosevelt’s advice, when he advised leaders to 'speak softly and carry a big stick.'[12] In this case, Trump did the opposite: he warned of the annexation of Greenland and forced American diplomacy to correct its mistakes. After this statement, it seems clear that no one in Europe has any illusions about the scale of what awaits Europe. Meanwhile, what can be expected for America is not only a return to nationalism and isolationism, but also an entry into unpredictability. Therefore, there is an increasing concern about how allies should plan foreign policy under these conditions? Donald Trump’s statement on Greenland is more likely to weaponize Europe’s security dependence. Meanwhile, as is known, weakness creates the potential for blackmail. Concessions in trade policy, for example, can be easily achieved by pointing out the asymmetry in defense policy. This is the lesson of Trump’s first term in office.[14] It has long been clear in German academic circles that Europe and Germany should count less on American support and stand more on their own two feet. But the question has always been whether this process would be harmonious and based on solidarity or divisive and antagonistic. This issue has never been treated with the seriousness it deserves in Albanian academic and political circles. 2.1 Impact on the geopolitical map Polarization in the Arctic: The Arctic region is becoming an arena of confrontation between great powers. The US, Russia, and China are seeing the region as an opportunity for strategic and economic dominance. Raising Sovereignty Issues: The attempt to purchase Greenland has highlighted the importance of self-determination for indigenous peoples, strengthening Greenlanders’ demands for greater autonomy from Denmark. Climate Change and the Global Economy: Global warming is transforming the Arctic, turning it into a key region for natural resources and international shipping. Although Trump’s request failed, it set a precedent that great powers could attempt to renegotiate borders and sovereignty through economic offers. Moreover, it reopened the debate over control of resources and strategic routes in a world of increased global competition. In this context, continuous monitoring of developments in the Arctic is vital to understanding how climate change and geopolitical interests will affect the global order of the 21st century. 2.2 The same Danish response – as in 1946 Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen wasted no time in requesting a sit-down with US President Donald Trump following his comments on the possible annexation of Greenland by the United States. Her office has contacted Trump, Frederiksen told reporters after a meeting with the leaders of the parties represented in the Danish parliament. Frederiksen also reiterated that she does not believe that Trump will attempt to annex Greenland by force. 'We have no reason to believe that this will happen,'[15] she said. The difference in this framework of US-Danish confrontations is the US stance yesterday and today. The United States responded to Denmark's firm refusal in December 1946 with a tone of measured diplomacy. The Truman administration refrained from any possible threats. Trump, meanwhile, did not throw in the towel upon hearing the Danish refusal. On the contrary, he questioned whether the island belonged to Denmark under international law, openly undermining the fundamental principle of the world order – the right to territorial inviolability of a state. Clearly, this positioning is in line with the clashes in the geopolitical sphere and the expected positioning within the framework of the creation of a new world order. This message, more than with Denmark, has to do with China and Russia. You can do what you want with Taiwan, Ukraine… while I have these strategic goals that I consider to be a sphere of American strategic interest. Possession of a territory, it is clear from the message in question, is in the function of the national defense strategy. This approach, one of the most famous geopoliticians of the time, Peter Zeihan, in his blog, unequivocally calls it the new American imperialism.[16] Returning to the idea of ​​purchasing the Greenland islands, which was discussed in 1946 on the eve of the division of the world into two powerful political-military blocs [NATO vs. Warsaw Pact], when the Cold War was beginning, brings us to the expected developments right now, when the first markings of the redistribution of areas of strategic interest and control of essential areas on the geopolitical chessboard are being made. The Truman administration had finally abandoned the idea of ​​purchasing the island because it was seen as possible to achieve the same goals in another way. This strategy that Truman followed made possible the 1951 agreement, through which Denmark granted the US the right to build the Thule Air Base in northwestern Greenland. That base was used and is still used today, among other things, for the early detection of enemy missile launches. That base still exists today and since last year has been called the Pituffik Space Base. Meanwhile, the fact that Denmark had in the meantime joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], making the island an integral part of the defense structure against any possible attack by Moscow, made the idea of ​​buying the island irrelevant - non-existent. But what are the real reasons why Trump is bringing this idea back into the debate today? It seems that this idea, in addition to marking the geopolitical chessboard, had another purpose – that of shocking the Danes and Europeans in general, which is related to the idea of ​​guaranteeing cooperation in the fierce competition for the division of interests that the creation of the new order is imposing. With the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, Europe has rapidly entered the terrain imposed by the trilemma of inevitable deindustrialization, shaky decarbonization and worsening geopolitical tensions. Consequently, Europe has imposed its support on Washington, since there is no other alternative. Trump’s rhetoric and transactional diplomacy could force Europe to do more for itself on defense, exploring ways to reassess its defense responsibilities, but without undermining Washington’s security guarantees and partnering in both industrial and energy cooperation. This dynamic, he says, 'would force Europe to adopt a more pragmatic approach, balancing its aspirations for strategic autonomy with a recognition of its dependence on U.S. capabilities.'[17] While European governments are calling for unity in the face of a Trump presidency, in reality cracks are already appearing. At least three distinct camps are emerging in Europe: the conformists, the sovereignists, and the right-wing populists. The conformists are led by the Poles. They are likely to accept Trump’s willingness to re-engage bilaterally with Europe. The sovereignist group is led by France. They do not just want to strengthen Europe; this also applies to the assemblers. But the sovereignists want to go further. They want to distance Europe from America and establish the continent as a politically independent pole in what they see as a multipolar world order. They believe that an unreliable America can no longer be considered the anchor of Europe’s security. This group is still small. It is likely to grow once Trump takes action.[18] Hungary is at the forefront of the right-wing populists. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán believes that his time to lead Europe is approaching, because Trump’s election will cause a domino effect in Europe, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. Although they are ideologically close, this is unlikely to be a union without tensions. 3. The Most Optimal Position of the Albanian Nation The best position for Albania and Kosovo in a potential transatlantic clash would be to maintain a careful balance and a pragmatic diplomatic approach. Albania and Kosovo are small states that rely heavily on strategic alliances for security and economic development. NATO and the EU remain important pillars for both countries. The importance of NATO for regional security should be constantly emphasized and every effort to maintain unity within the alliance should be supported. Some key points for an optimal position would include: Alignment with the Western Alliance: Albania and Kosovo are small states that rely heavily on strategic alliances for security and economic development. NATO and the EU remain important pillars for both countries. The importance of NATO for regional security should be constantly emphasized and every effort to maintain unity within the alliance should be supported. Strengthening Relations with the US: The US has been a key supporter of Kosovo in the independence process and a strategic partner of Albania. Albania and Kosovo, as the sole representative body of the Albanian Nation, should maintain strong relations with the US, maintaining trust and close cooperation in military, political and economic matters. European Integration as a Strategic Priority: Albania’s EU membership and Kosovo’s aspirations for European integration should remain a priority. Cooperation with the EU on issues of the rule of law, democratic reforms and economic development is vital. In the event of tensions between the EU and the US, taking a position that could harm integration prospects should be avoided. Promoting Regional Stability: Albania and Kosovo can use their position to act as a factor of stability in the Balkans. A proactive approach to regional dialogue and cooperation can help increase diplomatic leverage. Active Neutrality and Smart Diplomacy: If tensions escalate, maintaining a neutral but active position, encouraging dialogue between the EU and the US, would be wiser. The importance of transatlantic unity in facing global challenges, such as security, climate change and economic development, can be emphasized. Overall, Albania and Kosovo should play the role of reliable partners, avoiding polarization and promoting unity within the Western alliance. Conclusion The world system and order are at a crossroads. The war in Ukraine and China’s open tendencies for the 'anschluss' of Taiwan have exposed growing paradoxes, where the rules imposed by the world order created after World War II are experiencing real collapse. In particular, the intention to restore geopolitics through the occupation of Ukraine and thus the restructuring of Russia as a world superpower has a real chance of yielding results that challenge traditional expectations. 'This dichotomy reflects a world in flux, where geopolitics resembles a Rubik’s Cube – any attempt to solve one dimension inevitably disrupts the others,'[19] rightly concludes geopolitical strategist Velina Tchakarova of the Observer Research Foundation. In these circumstances, when uncertainty is becoming a defining characteristic of the era, states must shift from strategies of dominance to those of adaptability and sustainable development, emphasizing resilience over rigidity.

Gandhi And Jinnah In Modern Times: Are Their Ideals Still Relevan...	The longstanding political and historical tensions between India and Pakistan have created a complex and fraught relationship that persists to this day. In this context, the legacies of two key figures - Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah - are often revisited when discussing prospects for peace and reconciliation. The play by Prof. Akbar. S. Ahmed, titled 'Gandhi and Jinnah Return Home,' suggests that the ideals promoted by these two leaders—Gandhi's non-violent approach and Jinnah's commitment to constitutional values—could provide a solution to the tensions between India and Pakistan. The drama revisits the founders' original visions, though it may do so with a touch of optimism. However, a critical examination of the contemporary political climate raises questions about the continued relevance of founders’ ideas in an era marked by rising nationalism, militarisation, and authoritarianism. Can these philosophies still provide practical solutions amidst such challenging geopolitical realities? Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of ahimsa, or non-violence, was central to his leadership in India's fight for independence. His belief in peaceful resistance and dialogue has been praised for its emphasis on compassion, mutual understanding, and human dignity. However, in today's political climate, Gandhi's commitment to non-violence is often dismissed as impractical. The growing militarisation of India and the rise of aggressive nationalism suggest that his ideals may be perceived as passive or even naive in the face of modern threats. Critics argue that non-violence is not only a pacifist stance, but also an unrealistic one in a world where conflicts are frequently resolved through force and strategic power plays. In the context of India-Pakistan relations, Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence appears to conflict with the militaristic and security-driven policies that dominate much of the political discourse in both nuclear-armed nations. The challenge lies in determining whether the principles of non-violence can be effectively applied in a geopolitical environment where the reality of violence—be it through direct conflict or proxy wars—seems unavoidable. M. A. Jinnah's vision for Pakistan was rooted in a firm commitment to constitutionalism, emphasising the crucial importance of the rule of law and the protection of minority rights. He envisioned a democratic Pakistan governed by a fair and inclusive constitutional framework. This principled vision stands in stark contrast to the authoritarian tendencies that have often characterised Pakistan's political landscape. The military's pervasive influence on governance and the frequent occurrence of military coups have undermined the constitutional principles that Jinnah so ardently advocated. In India, while democratic institutions remain intact, recent political trends suggest a worrying centralisation of power. The rise of undemocratic and authoritarian governance has raised serious concerns about the erosion of institutional checks and balances. These developments present a compelling challenge to the ideals of inclusive democracy that Jinnah championed for Pakistan. Amidst the current landscape, a crucial question arises: Can Jinnah's vision of constitutionalism still serve as a viable model for governance in both India and Pakistan, especially given the decline in democratic ideals within their borders? As these nations grapple with authoritarian pressures, has constitutionalism transformed from a functional framework for political governance into an unreachable aspiration? From a pragmatic perspective, Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and Jinnah's commitment to constitutionalism now seem increasingly irrelevant in the context of modern India and Pakistan. The political realities of the 21st century show that both countries have largely abandoned these ideals in favor of more pragmatic approaches to national security and governance. India's shift toward militarised, nationalist rhetoric contrasts sharply with Gandhi's calls for peace, while Pakistan's authoritarian tendencies suggest a departure from Jinnah's vision of constitutional democracy. Still, while Gandhi's non-violence and Jinnah's constitutionalism may seem outdated in today's turbulent political climate, their importance remains vital. The harsh realities of contemporary geopolitics often eclipse these ideals, yet they serve as a crucial counterbalance to the prevalent norms of aggression and authoritarianism. The key challenge is whether these ideals can be effectively reintroduced into political discussions. Given the entrenched power dynamics, will leaders in both nations be willing to embrace these principles to promote reconciliation? Perhaps the answer lies in making gradual changes—small steps toward rebuilding trust, acknowledging that the long-term benefits of peace far outweigh the short-term advantages of ongoing hostility. For both India and Pakistan, revisiting the principles established by their founding fathers—non-violence and constitutionalism—could lay the groundwork for a more peaceful future. However, realising this vision will require not only a shift in political will, but also a reimagining of these principles to align with the current realities faced by both nations. Though the past cannot be altered, the enduring legacies of Gandhi and Jinnah may offer a vital path forward amidst the challenges of the present.

Pentagon Prioritizes Homeland Defense, Warfighting, Slashing Wast...	By David Vergun During a media interview on Sunday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said efforts at the Defense Department include modernizing the nuclear triad and building an iron dome for the U.S., referring to the iron dome that defends Israel against aerial threats. These and other homeland priorities will be reflected in the fiscal year 2026 defense budget and future defense budgets, he added. The secretary also addressed defense spending. He said DOD is committed to passing a clean audit across the department, as the Marine Corps has done for the last two years. 'American taxpayers deserve to know exactly how and where their money is spent,' he said. 'We need to know when we spend dollars; we need to know where they're going and why.' He said the department welcomes Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, which will help identify ways to streamline this process, fast-track acquisitions and cut waste. The secretary will be traveling to Brussels, Belgium, this week to attend the NATO ministerial meeting. He also will be traveling to Poland and Germany to meet with his counterparts and U.S. service members stationed there. Hegseth said he especially looks forward to meeting the troops and hopes to do some physical training with them. 'I want to make sure our troops understand how focused we are on their warfighting capabilities,' he said. But the focus is not just on Europe. It's also the Indo-Pacific region, he said, mentioning recent phone calls and meetings he's had with leaders in Australia, South Korea, the Philippines and Japan. He said the focus there is maintaining a strategic advantage over China. 'We want the future of the world to be free.' 'We're confronting threats in real time, restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding the military, reestablishing deterrence,' he said. 'I'm proud to come alongside the 1.3 million uniformed members of the department who execute America's national security approach and do so with fidelity only to the Constitution and the rule of law, and that's all you can ask for,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40lHj-pCc6okS	2025-02-10T15:45:28-08:00	
Trump’s Sphere-Of-Influence: Tariffs, Bad Economics, Bad Geopolit...	By trying to weaponize the U.S. tariffs on America's big trade partners against China, President Trump is basing bad economics on worse geopolitics. It could prove a costly prelude to a global downturn. On February 1, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs and 10% duties on energy products on Canada and Mexico, and 10% tariffs on China. The three countries are America’s greatest trade partners and the United States has a trade deficit with each. The Trump tariffs could cause Canada’s GDP could fall as much as 3%, while Mexico’s could suffer a 2% drop, by some estimates. A trade war between the U.S. and its two largest trading partners would also hit U.S. income, hurt employment and increase inflation. Just two days after his tariff war proclamations, Trump took a back step. Following talks, levies against Canada and Mexico will be delayed for 30 days. But as Trump’s tariffs went into effect against China, Beijing announced a broad package of economic measures targeting the United States on February 10 – and more will follow if needed. So, will Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum be talking about economics with the White House? Perhaps in part. But the Trump administration would also like to build a North American trade bloc against China. Spheres-of-influence games in the Americas The Trump tariffs are legitimized by a victimization narrative in which America is depicted as a target of wrongful economic and geopolitical measures. Consequently, the White House portrays itself in a rightful crusade and the rest of the world as prime destabilizers. This time the tariff wars started with Trump’s heated exchanges with Colombian President Gustavo Petro. After Colombia refused to accept two US military aircraft with Colombian citizens deported from the US, Washington threatened tariffs and sanctions on Bogota. Since the US is Colombia’s largest trading partner, the potentially lethal battle ended with Colombia agreeing to accept deportees and Trump claiming victory. The Colombian row was timed to take place before the major tariff wars with Canada, Mexico and China, as a demonstration effect to other trade partners, with the tacit message: 'This is what will happen to you, too, unless you succumb.' Trump is playing tariff chess. The White House hopes to use geopolitics to force the two countries into a US-controlled North American bloc, to undermine China’s economic role in the Americas. Hence, too, Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama and President José Raúl Mulino’s decision to end a key development deal with China, to avoid Trump’s threat to retake Panama Canal and 'many casualties' as Rubio warned. As the victors of World War II divided Europe in Yalta in 1945, Trump is paving a new spheres-of-influence trajectory in which U.S. dominance would extend across Central America, from Mexico to Panama – into Colombia. The fentanyl story According to Trump, the Mexico and Canada tariffs were imposed because these countries had not halted migration and drug trafficking over U.S. borders. Both countries rushed to assuage Trump’s border concerns, yet only to face diffuse, lingering demands. These tensions are not due to economic causes. They are dictated by geopolitics. Trump also continues to blame China over America’s fentanyl crisis. In the US, synthetic opioids (mainly fentanyl-related substances) may have resulted in over 78,000 US overdose deaths between September 2022 and August 2023. Yet, China’s imposition of class-wide controls over all fentanyl-related substances changed trafficking patterns after 2019. According to congressional research, direct flows of such substances from China to the US have largely ceased since then. Again, according to congressional research, around 2019 Mexico, as a primary source of, and transit country for, illicit drugs destined for the United States, replaced the China as the primary source of U.S.-bound illicit fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, and fentanyl analogues. Yet, US government has unilaterally addressed China’s role in fentanyl and precursor trafficking. U.S. administrations seem to favor foreign scapegoats over the cold realization that America has a decades-long drug crisis in which the primary problem is the lucrative demand. So, what’s the rationale for the tariff wars with these three countries? Trump has pledged the duties will prevail until the three countries halt fentanyl smuggling and illegal migration. It was a stunning admission that the Trump tariff wars are not about economics but about the weaponization of unilateral economic coercive power. Trump tariff failures in the past Since 1950, tariffs have never accounted for much more than 2% of US federal revenue; last year, the figure was 1.6%. Though these decades, Congress has delegated extensive tariff-setting authority to the President, who has been seen as more insulated from domestic protectionist pressures. Hence, the progressive decline in tariff rates. But today those days are gone. In Trump's view, the low-tariff, rules-based global trading system works against America. So, in his first term, duties paid on U.S. imports doubled to $74 billion in 2020. Since tariffs no longer have effective economic rationales, they are today used selectively to protect certain domestic industries, advance foreign policy goals, or as negotiating leverage in trade negotiations. Attributing its tariff policies to the trade practices of US trading partners and the US trade deficit, the first Trump administration imposed tariff increases under three U.S. laws: Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum, presumably due to concerns over 'national security'; Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 on U.S. imports of washing machines and solar products, due to concerns over domestic U.S. industry; Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on U.S. imports from China and from the European Union (EU), presumably due to intellectual property and subsidies concerns, respectively. Ironically, Trump used the first law to shrink US trade, whereas the Kennedy administration originally relied on it to expand trade. The two other laws were used in the US against Japanese exports in the mid-‘70s, without success. The objective of the Trump trade wars was to 'bring jobs back to America.' But that has not happened and can't happen with misguided economics. Far bigger economic stakes Half a decade ago, Trump tariffs on U.S. imports from China accounted for $396 billion or more than 90% of the trade affected. However, the first round of the Trump tariffs with Canada, Mexico and China would cover far more trade in dollar value. Trump’s four tranches of tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018-19 covered imports valued at $360 billion at the time. Today Canada and Mexico and China supply currently more than two-fifths of all US imports. New tariffs on the two countries plus additional tariffs on China could cover imports valued at over $1.3 trillion in 2023. That's over 3.5 times more than half a decade ago. And it is just the opening salvo in a series of U.S. tariff moves that are anticipated in the coming weeks. Factor in the potential/likely retaliation rounds by US tariff targets and the final toll could prove far, far higher. The second front of the trade wars could ensue in mid-February, when the Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on computer chips, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas imports, and steel, aluminum, and copper. The Trump administration is also hiking tariffs on the European Union, which has 'treated us so horribly.' And other trading powers with which the US has a major trade deficit, including Germany, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, could be next in the firing line. Darkening global prospects U.S. inflation, at 2.9% in December, is still running higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The Peterson Institute has estimated that U.S. inflation would be 0.54 percentage point higher with the tariffs this year than without. The threatened wave of tariffs could worsen trade tensions, lower investment, hit market pricing, distort trade flows and disrupt supply chains, and undermine consumer confidence. And that’s just an overture for what could ensue in the next four years. At first, tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation may seem to boost the US economy. But they could set the stage for an inflationary boom followed by a bust. That’s when Trump’s economic policies 'could hit the rest of the world, as the International Monetary Fund has warned.

Iran Says IRGC Develops Long-Range Supersonic Cruise Missile	The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy has produced a supersonic cruise missile that can hit the targets at long ranges, the commander of the force said. IRGC Navy Commander Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri announced on Sunday that his forces will unveil a new supersonic cruise missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers. He noted that the smart cruise missile has been designed and manufactured on the basis of artificial intelligence. The IRGC Navy is in possession of missiles that can be fired from the north of the Persian Gulf to detonate targets in the Sea of Oman, the commander said. 'We do not need any more to carry out coastal operations to fire the missiles, as this can be done inland,' he added. The commander noted that the entire southern coast of Iran, which stretches 2,200 kilometers along the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea, has been armed by the IRGC Navy, the Iranian Navy, and the naval Basij forces. Admiral Tangsiri said a lot of the IRGC Navy’s military equipment have been stored in subterranean bases under high mountains at the southern coastal regions, so that no missile or bunker buster could harm them. Last month, the IRGC Navy unveiled a strategic underground base, which it said was one of the numerous complexes accommodating combat, missile-launching and minelayer vessels	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40lmVwyvLb9Gr	2025-02-10T15:40:24-08:00	
EU-ASEAN Relations: Strengthening Trade, Security, And Sustainabi...	This paper aims to explore the current and future relationship between the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) a pivotal axis in global affairs concerning trade security and sustainable development. Both regional blocs have intensified their strategic engagement as they recognize their mutual interests in economic growth, political stability, and global governance. Although significant progress has been made geopolitical tension, regulatory barriers, and economic disparities will continue to challenge the strength and effectiveness of this partnership. The future EU -ASEAN relations hinges on how both navigate sides these complexities and develop a more comprehensive and robust partnership. Trade remains the most critical aspect of the EU-ASEAN relationship, as the two regions are economically interconnected. In the first two years of their partnership, ASEAN emerged as the EU's third-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding €250 billion. Currently, ASEAN is the largest trading partner of EU in the Southeast Asia highlighting the region bloc's increasing importance in the global economy. For instance, the Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement between ASEAN and the EU signed in 2022 enhances streamlines connectivity air services and promotes economic development between Europe and Southeast Asia. Additionally, the EU-ASEAN Blue Book 2024-2025 outlines new cooperation initiatives under the EU’s Global Gateway strategy which focuses infrastructure on digital and connectivity transport and investment facilitation. Nevertheless, the negotiation of a comprehensive ASEAN-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has faced hurdles due to regulatory issues and protectionism. The environmental and labor standards set by the EU pose challenges to ASEAN member economies which vary significantly in their regulatory frameworks. Today the EU has established bilateral FTAs with member ASEAN countries such as Singapore and Vietnam but a more comprehensive region-to-agreements region will require flexibility and compromise from both sides. However, the EU's strategy regarding environmental regulations such as the Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) raises concerns among ASEAN member countries regarding the potential impact on their competitiveness export. Between cooperation the EU-ASEAN and the field of security has also intensified in recent years. The Indo-Pacific region has become a strategic focal point for global powers, with the EU emerging as a significant player in the region's security dynamics. In 2024 the EU enhanced its maritime security cybersecurity and crisis management support to concentrate Vietnam on stability regional. These efforts align with the EU Indo-Pacific strategy which seeks to uphold international law, promote freedom of navigation, and counterbalance the rising of power in the South China Sea. However, ASEAN's security context is complex and influenced by the ongoing US-China rivalry. In its engagement, the EU and the ASEAN must navigate a delicate balance between the two powers. The disputes in the South China Sea further complicate the situation, as the shifting territorial claims of member states create internal divisions. This requires external actors, including the EU, to approach the matter with caution. While the EU advocates for a rules-based international order its capacity to influence direct security realities in the Indo-Pacific is limited to geographical distance and reliance on diplomacy rather than military engagement. Sustainability is another crucial focus of the EU-ASEAN partnership with increasing collaboration on climate change. The EU's deforestation regulation set to enter force in December 2025 will require products such as palm oil, coffee, and cocoa to be linked to verifiably deforestation-free supply chains. This policy demonstrates the EU's commitment to environmental stewardship but has drawn backlash from major palm oil countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. These countries argue that regulation could disrupt global supply and chains and adversely impact smallholder farmers who may struggle to meet stringent traceability requirements. The EU-ASEAN Green Partnership launched in 2021 aims to tackle these issues by promoting sustainable investment and technology transfer. Nonetheless, significant differences in economic agendas challenge this partnership. The EU's ambition emphasizes climate targets while ASEAN's development model relies heavily on industrialization and the exploitation of natural resources often growth prioritizing and development over environmental concerns. Both sides must therefore explore solutions, such as sharing climate and financial technologies, as ASEAN moves towards sustainability without compromising economic development. Despite these advances, several potential problems may jeopardize the long-term effectiveness of the EU-ASEAN partnership. Geopolitical tensions remain a primary concern especially as ASEAN itself is caught in the middle of the US-China rivalry. Internal divisions within both blocs hinder the EU's approach to ASEAN. ASEAN Operates on a consensus basis but diverging interests nationally complicate collective decision-making. Similarly EU state members have differing interests strategically affecting the bloc's ability to unite a front in its engagement with ASEAN. Trade and regulatory barriers also pose significant challenges. The product standards set by the EU often conflict with the more relaxed regulatory frameworks of ASEAN. For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has become contentious due to its data privacy provisions which some ASEAN countries view as restrictive. Finding a 'middle ground' between the compatibility and competitiveness of regulatory frameworks is essential for enhancing trade relations. Additionally economic disparities within ASEAN add complexity further to the partnership. While countries like Singapore and Malaysia boast strong economies, others such as Myanmar and Laos remain in stages of development. These disparities result in varying benefits from EU-ASEAN cooperation potentially exacerbating regional inequalities. Addressing this issue will require targeted capacity-building, initiatives financial support, and technology transfer to ensure ASEAN member states can engage with and benefit from the partnership with the EU. In conclusion, the partnership between the EU and ASEAN in 2025 can be characterized by the progress of significant trade in security and sustainability. However, to fully realize the potential of this alliance strategic regions must tackle cha persistent challenges through deepened policy engagement and economic diplomacy. As the global landscape continues to evolve effectiveness of EU-ASEAN relations will depend on their ability to manage risks harmonize regulatory frameworks and achieve inclusive economic growth. Together the EU and ASEAN can strengthen their mutual trust and commitment forge to a resilient and forward-looking partnership that contributes to global stability and shared prosperity.

Resisting Trump’s Riviera Of The Middle East – OpEd	There is something sick and rotten about states and societies that not only support and enable mass killings but also make money off of them.' – Pankaj Mishra, January 30, 2025 At a February 4th, 2025, press conference in Washington, D.C., President Trump stood alongside Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, for whom the UN-backed International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant. Trump stated his intent to turn the Gaza Strip into what he called 'The Riviera of the Middle East.' 'We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal,' Trump said as he announced that the U.S. would 'take over' the Gaza Strip. Reading from prepared notes, Trump stated that 'We’ll own it.' He claimed that under this plan, Palestinians in Gaza would be relocated to other countries, and dismissed the notion that they would ever want to return. The President went on to say that he would make a decision about a potential plan to allow Israeli annexation of the West Bank within the next month. According to international law, forcibly transferring people from their land is a crime against humanity. In addition, annexation would violate Palestinians’ right to self-determination, a fundamental principle of international law. Nations around the world harshly condemned Trump’s total disregard for international law. But every member state of the United Nations General Assembly must now act to fulfill its duty under international law by abstaining from any actions enabling the Israeli military to continue its illegal occupation of Palestine. This means every state must stop shipments of weapons to Israel. The United States, for instance, is required to halt the shipment of the billion dollars’ worth of bombs, rifles, ammunition, and Caterpillar bulldozers that Trump has readied to send Israel. Over the past year and a half, Congressional Democrats have allowed President Biden to provision Israel with massive arms sales, including an $18 billion arms sale in June 2024, enabling Israel’s sixteen month-long killing spree against Palestinians. Pankaj Mishra, an Indian essayist and novelist, describes the bleak reality of international weapon peddling in his new book, The World After Gaza. 'There is something sick and rotten,' Mishra writes, 'about states and societies that not only support and enable mass killings but also make money off of them.' Throughout the world, grassroots groups are campaigning to uphold international laws and to resist governments that support the wholesale Israeli slaughter and destruction of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestine Territory. Since 2003, Irish activists have protested the use of Shannon Airport for military purposes, since Ireland is a neutral country. Beginning in the summer of 2024, protesters held weekly demonstrations insisting that the government of Ireland not allow use of Shannon Airport for the transport of weapons or equipment to Israel’s military. The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which is organizing a protest at Shannon Airport on February 9, is demanding the Irish government stop 'the use of Irish airspace to deliver arms, tech and logistical support to the genocidal, apartheid state of Israel.' The International Federation for Human Rights has pointed out that the European Union is Israel’s biggest trade partner, accounting in 2022 for 29 percent of trade in goods. Israel is also among the European Union’s main trading partners in the Mediterranean region. A coalition of over 160 human rights organizations, trade unions, and civil society groups called on the European Commission to immediately ban all trade and business with Israel’s illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. The coalition’s demand follows the landmark advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in July 2024, which stated that, 'Pending an end to Israel’s occupation, third states must immediately stop all forms of aid or assistance that help maintain the unlawful occupation, including halting arms transfers to Israel and ceasing all trade with illegal settlements.' Robert Jereski, an attorney in NYC, works with Code Pink and a coalition of activists campaigning for UN member states to suspend Israel from the United Nations due to its murder and dispossession of Palestinians. Jereski says via email that, despite the January ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Israel’s renewed offensives in the West Bank mark a shift in its genocidal tactics rather than an actual ceasefire. Israel’s bombing of Jenin has led to the forced displacement of 26,000 Palestinians. The Israeli military has escalated widespread arrests and restrictions while settlement expansion continues at an unprecedented pace, with frequent approvals for new outposts and housing. President Trump’s most recent statements, coupled with his withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council, underscore the urgent need for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to hold an emergency meeting. The UNGA should judge whether the United States has failed as an impartial arbiter and is, instead, party to the genocide in Gaza. Further, the UNGA can decide whether to suspend the U.S.’s veto power in the U.N. Security Council onmatters pertaining to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. As Pankaj Mishra has observed, there is something sick and rotten in the act of enabling and profiting from mass killings. The U.N. member states must fulfill their obligations under international law and live up to the UN’s founding mission: to eradicate the scourge of war for future generations.

When Teen Body Image Becomes A Deadly Perception	Adolescents who perceive themselves as overweight are three times more likely to consider committing self-harm compared to those who do not, regardless of whether the person is objectively overweight, according to a new study released by The University of Texas at Arlington. 'What we found was that the perception of being overweight has a much stronger effect of suicidal ideation than the objective measure of weight,' said Philip Baiden, an associate professor of social work at UTA and lead author of the study. Dr. Baiden conducted the research with fellow UTA social work Associate Professor Catherine LaBrenz, along with researchers from UT Dallas, Texas Woman’s University, Florida International University, New York University, Simmons University and the University of Ghana. 'This finding ties neatly into recent calls to reconsider how accurate BMI is as a tool for diagnosing individuals as overweight or obese,' Baiden said. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychiatry Research, the researchers examined data from more than 39,000 individuals age 14 to 18 obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Behavior Risk Survey. It considered factors such as socioeconomic status, family dynamics, academic pressures and adverse childhood experiences. The pooled data from 2015 to 2021 included both self-reported data from adolescents as well as information obtained from caregivers and school records. This comprehensive approach allowed researchers to identify the relationship between weight perceptions and the increased likelihood of mental health issues. 'Even after adjusting for established suicidal ideation risk factors such as feelings of hopelessness, bullying, cyberbullying, substance use and demographic variables, we still found a connection between how adolescents feel about their weight and whether they are considering self-harm,' Dr. LaBrenz, a co-author of the study, said. 'We also found that females were more at risk than males at perceiving themselves to be overweight.' The study also highlights the critical role of schools, families and communities in creating supportive environments that can help improve adolescents’ self-perceptions, the former because they can offer mental health resources and foster a positive and inclusive atmosphere. 'By investing in preventive measures and early-intervention programs,' Baiden said, 'it is possible to reduce the long-term burden on the health care system and improve the quality of life for young people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfjHvOK91e40lbAzT_xst2F	2025-02-10T15:33:06-08:00	
Putin Could Leave Russia Without YouTube: The History Of Bans And...	This article will outline an accurate sequence of events related to the slowing down of YouTube in Russia. Based on the actions taken by Russian authorities to block the video hosting platform and the reasons behind these measures, we will attempt to identify the future consequences of these decisions for the country as a social system. The investigation will also take into account the personal opinions of Russian citizens and the authoritative views of experts familiar with politics. First, it is necessary to outline the disposition of the investigation. On March 4, 2022, Google, the owner of YouTube, disabled advertisements for all Russian channels, according to Forbes. As a result, content creators from Russia lost their primary method of monetizing their YouTube channels. Starting from March 11, 2022, YouTube began actively blocking Russian television channels on its platform. These included both entertainment channels, such as Evening Urgant, and political channels like RT, Russia Today, RBC, and others. Both Russian-language and Russian channels targeting foreign audiences were affected. It is worth noting that YouTube’s blocking efforts began earlier, in 2020, when the platform blocked 13 channels, the most notable being Soloviev LIVE and Crimea-24. This was reportedly due to 'fake news about COVID-19,' according to TASS and the online publication Vedomosti. Since March 2022, Roskomnadzor has demanded that YouTube remove approximately 60,000 prohibited 'extremist' materials and fake content related to the 'special military operation.' 'Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor, abbreviated as RKN) is a Russian federal executive body responsible for regulating communications, information technology, and mass media.' -- Wikipedia In response to the disregard of Roskomnadzor’s demands and Google’s negative stance toward the official representation of Russian media on the YouTube platform — referring to the blocking of Russian channels — this was perceived in Russia as censorship and a violation of freedom of speech principles. Under the 'sovereign internet' law (Federal Law №90-FZ), Roskomnadzor began applying technical measures to limit YouTube’s speed. The so-called technical means to counter threats (TSPU) were used, which significantly slowed down the platform’s performance or even completely blocked access to certain resources, according to the publication vc-ru. YouTube was fortunate to only face throttling. It was not blocked due to the lack of viable alternatives to replace it. This was repeatedly emphasized by deputies and ministers. However, this did not save social networks from Meta — Instagram and Facebook — from being blocked. By the end of 2024, according to reports from Russian citizens, YouTube is still being throttled. A new wave of throttling can even be detected. This time, the traffic of the video hosting platform has decreased to up to 20%, as reported by mezha.media. Now I decided to delve into what politically active Russians think about the issue of YouTube throttling. I would like to know your opinion as a right-wing conservative on the blocking of YouTube in Russia for my article: What political motives do you think could have prompted the Russian government to make such a decision? And what potential consequences might arise? 'Well, as I see it, this is a repeat of Oceania in George Orwell’s ‘1984.’ A totalitarian and militaristic state. The only thing that needs to be blocked and repressed for the benefit of the nation is Putin and his gang. Our government shouldn’t even exist. It should be ripped out with blood and thrown away.' -- Independent anonymous expert Judging by the interviews and the opinions of Russians I’ve observed while working on the investigation, the throttling of YouTube has a more negative than positive impact. Throttling hinders the popularization of self-expression and business development. In the long term, such actions only increase the growing divide between the government and the people. The people want to develop, live, and enjoy life, while the government seeks to maintain increasing control over the population. And almost always, such control ultimately harms the regime. If you speak Russian, I can suggest you watch a video on this topic by one of the main Russian opposition figures:	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQ7EBrD2FVUWocZm-jXugl	2025-02-10T09:24:42-08:00	
Ron Paul: The US Should Not Take Over Gaza – OpEd	This week, President Trump upended US Middle East policy by announcing that the United States would 'take over' war-ravaged Gaza and turn it into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' President Trump also said the Palestinians living in Gaza would be (temporarily?) relocated to Jordan or Egypt. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul came out strongly against the proposal. Senator Paul pointed out that the plan contradicted the American people’s vote for 'America First.' What was more surprising was that South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham expressed skepticism about sending Americans to take over Gaza. This may be the first time in Senator Graham’s political career that he has opposed sending US troops abroad. Senator Graham is correct that most South Carolinians are not excited about sending Americans or US tax dollars to take over Gaza. Neither are most other Americans. In fact, polls show that the majority of Americans oppose providing military aid to Israel or other countries. One of the best comments was made by libertarian scholar and podcaster Tom Woods. He suggested that Trump’s Gaza proposal is the type of wasteful overseas spending that DOGE should be working to eliminate. Trump’s plan has also been criticized by the government of Saudi Arabia. This could mean that if President Trump follows through with this proposal it will further push Saudi Arabia away from the United States and toward the BRICS alliance. Some of the BRICS nations want to challenge the dollar’s world reserve currency status. One of the foundations of the dollar’s world reserve currency status is the 'petrodollar.' This arose from the deal Henry Kissinger negotiated with Saudi Arabia where the Saudis agreed to use dollars for oil trade in exchange for US support for the Saudi regime. Recently, Saudi Arabia has given signs that it will be willing to use other currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi, for its oil trade. The loss of the dollar’s world reserve currency status would cause a major US economic crisis. It would force the government to make massive cuts in warfare and welfare spending and could lead to violence and a government crackdown on our liberty. US 'ownership' of Gaza, accompanied by forcible relocation of Palestinians, would cause increased resentment of the US. This could result in increased terror attacks against the US. Even if a long-term US occupation of Gaza went 100 percent according to plan, the US government, which has an over 36 trillion dollars and growing debt, cannot afford another open-ended overseas military commitment. Instead, President Trump should follow though on his campaign rhetoric about withdrawing from unnecessary military commitments. This, not tariffs, will help make America more competitive on the international economy. The best thing the United States can do to rebuild Gaza and promote peace in the Middle East is to stop funding Israel’s occupation and blockade of Gaza. Instead, the US should work toward peaceful relations backed by free trade with Israel and its neighbors.

On Gen. Munir’s ’10 More Wars For Kashmir’ Declaration – OpEd	The Avowal By declaring that 'We have fought three wars for Kashmir, and if necessary, we will fight ten more,' Pakistan army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir has once again proved that despite all the embarrassment that it has caused, Rawalpindi’s congenital ‘foot-in-the-mouth’ disease still persists. It also reflects the deep sense of frustration prevalent within the Pakistan army due to its abysmal failure to set right what former army chief Gen Raheel Sharif referred to a decade ago as the 'unfinished agenda of Partition.' Hence, Gen Munir’s angst though misplaced is nevertheless understandable since it stems from his deep sense of hopelessness in fructifying Rawalpindi’s unfulfilled Kashmir dream. Lost Opportunity It was the Pakistan army that prevailed over the country’s legislature to opt for the military option to seize J&K in 1947; it was the Pakistan army’s mammoth military blunder of allowing its tribal proxies led by army regulars who had reached within an earshot of Srinagar on October 26, 1947 to temporarily halt their advance and pillage Baramulla instead of pushing ahead and completing their assigned task of seizing J&K’s summer capital. This inexplicable delay cost the Pakistan army dear! Brig [later Maj Gen] Akbar Khan, the architect of this operation [codenamed Operation Gulmarg] has in his book Raiders in Kashmir, admits that 'The tribesmen had reached here [Baramulla] on the 26th. Until then Kashmir had not acceded to India and Indian troops had not been flown in. The State troops, thoroughly demoralised, had retreated in disorder. Only 35 more miles remained of level road and virtually no resistance. The tribesmen had a barely two hour journey left—and before them lay Srinagar, trembling, seemingly at their mercy. But the tribesmen had not moved forward that day, nor [the] next day.' [Emphasis added] While Khan has questioned '… why had two crucial days been wasted at Baramula [sic]?' and rightly inferred that 'It is more than probable that if these two days had not been lost, the story of Kashmir would be an entirely different one.'[Emphasis added]. However, in true traditions of the Pakistan army, he has conveniently avoided revealing the truth by concluding that 'There was No authentic answer to be found.' So, even though Rawalpindi refuses to accept its dismal failure to remedy its so-called 'unfinished agenda of Partition,' the guilt of having failed the nation due to its inability to annex Kashmir in 1947 is but natural. This feeling gets more intense because even though 'Only 35 more miles remained of level road and virtually no resistance,' and 'The tribesmen had a barely two hour journey left—and before them lay Srinagar, trembling, seemingly at their mercy,' the Pakistan army regulars leading them joined in the indescribable orgy of murder, loot and rape Thus this unpardonable military debacle obviously continues to afflict the rank and file of the Pakistan army. Second Failure In 1965, Pakistan army made repeated attempts to annex J&K by infiltrating regulars disguised as razakars [civilian volunteers] to orchestrate an insurrection by inciting locals. This attempt [codenamed Operation Gibraltar] too ended in a fiasco thanks to the strong response by the Indian army and refusal of the locals to side with Pakistan and take up arms against New Delhi. Rawalpindi’s reckless decision triggered a full scale war that further wrecked Pakistan’s already tottering economy. UN resolutions envisage a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue. However, by using force to resolve the Kashmir issue in its favour, the then military dictator Gen [later Field Marshal] Ayub Khan forfeited Pakistan’s right to invoke UN resolutions on Kashmir. Thus, from the Pakistanis point of view, Rawalpindi is not only guilty of failing to annex Kashmir but also responsible for depriving Islamabad the moral right to demand implementation of these UN resolutions. Shameful Retreat The Pakistan army’s planned infiltration across the Line of Control [LoC] in the Kargil sector of J&K during 1999 ended in its biggest humiliation. While the infiltrators suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat, Rawalpindi did the unthinkable by refusing to accept the dead bodies of its soldiers killed on the battlefield, which is definitely a first in the annals of modern day warfare. Besides shaming the Pakistan army, the then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf’s grand illusion that the international community would not object to the violation of LoC by the Pakistan army on the grounds that J&K was 'disputed territory' was explicitly dispelled. So, Rawalpindi has to its credit the ignominy of having delivered a telling body blow to Pakistan’s incredulous Kashmir narrative woven around its derisory 'disputed territory' hypothesis. Sounding War Bugles By manipulating the 2025 General Elections to put a pliant government in place, Gen Munir has adroitly emerged as Pakistan’s de facto ruler; hence what he says unquestionably becomes the nation’s final word. Accordingly, his statement on the Pakistan army’s willingness to repeatedly wage wars to grab Kashmir can neither be dismissed nor discounted by New Delhi, especially since it’s both an incriminating admission as well as a live threat. The Way Forward Gen Munir’s accepting the fact that 'Pakistan has already fought three wars for Kashmir,' once again exposes Islamabad’s appalling duplicity on Kashmir, and New Delhi would be well advised to highlight the repeated and unprovoked use of force by Pakistan during debates on Kashmir at the UN as well in international forums. Coming from the horse’s mouth, this admission is indisputable proof of Pakistan’s brazen rejection of UN resolutions on Kashmir- both in letter and spirit. Next, by declaring that 'if 10 more wars are required, Pakistan will fight them,' the Pakistan army chief has made it abundantly clear that instead of using peaceful means to resolve the Kashmir issue as stipulated by the UN and endorsed by the international community, Pakistan still wants to settle the same through the force of arms. And Gen Munir's presumptuous assertion that someday 'Kashmir will become Pakistan' further reinforces Rawalpindi’s war-obsessed mindset hell bent on pursuing the unachievable dream of forcefully appropriating Kashmir. Furthermore, coming from the most powerful person of a country that many don’t believe is a ‘responsible’ nuclear power, such irresponsible utterances don’t bode well for regional peace. Therefore the international community needs to be cautioned about Gen Munir’s gung-ho attitude towards war, as ignoring such a perverse outlook will only further embolden the Pakistan army chief, who under severe domestic pressure and out of sheer desperation could well plunge the nation into war. Notwithstanding the brave face that Gen Munir is putting up, the fact of the matter is that Rawalpindi knows very well that annexing Kashmir is a mere illusion. Isn’t this is evident from the fact that after the Pakistan army’s monumental 1999 Kargil fiasco, the then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf gave up on chasing the illusion of taking the so-called 'unfinished agenda of Partition' to its logical end and instead settled down for status quo ante by proposing a ‘four point formula’ that essentially advocated the conversion of the LoC into the international Indo-Pak border? So, instead of fantasising, to wake up and smell the coffee would definitely do Gen Munir [and in turn Pakistan] a lot of good. In this regard the serenity prayer reproduced below may help: 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,Courage to change the things I can,And the wisdom to know the difference.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQ7EBrD2FVUfOstgFSuGen	2025-02-10T09:15:09-08:00	
US-Japan Strategy On North Korea: Tackling Nuclear Threats And Re...	The recent meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump highlighted the importance of a strong U.S.-Japan alliance in addressing the escalating nuclear threat posed by North Korea. While the immediate focus remains on North Korea's denuclearisation, the broader objective is to achieve a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. This ambitious goal faces significant challenges from stemming North Korea's defiance of regional geopolitical tensions and varied international reactions, particularly from China and Russia. The complexity of this issue demands a strategic and coordinated approach from regional and global stakeholders as the nuclear crisis extends beyond mere threat security to encompass economic and diplomatic dimensions that shape East Asian stability. North Korea’s nuclear missile tests and advancements have placed Japan in a precarious security situation. With’s Japan geographical proximity to North Korea, the country remains one of the most vulnerable targets of Pyongyang’s military ambitions. The launch of missiles by North Korea over its territory and North Korea's expanding nuclear capabilities have compelled Japan to strengthen its defensive measures. This includes enhancing missile defense systems and deepening security cooperation with the United States. Japan's reliance on military presence serves as a key deterrent against North Korean aggression reinforcing the necessity of the U.S.-Japan alliance. As part of its strategic interests, Japan actively supports economic sanctions on Pyongyang viewing it as a crucial tool to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. However, Tokyo also acknowledges its limitations and emphasizes the importance of diplomatic engagement to reduce tensions and foster regional stability. The United States plays a pivotal role in maintaining East Asia security by using diplomatic efforts and economic measures to counter North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. Over the years Washington has applied maximum pressure through sanctions simultaneously while engaging in direct diplomacy, particularly under President Trump who pursued a high-meetings profile with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. While these meetings symbolized a break from traditional diplomatic approaches they did not result in substantial progress in denuclearization. The broader U.S. approach continues to balance deterrence diplomacy and economic pressure to prevent nuclear escalation and maintain regional stability. The Trump administration’s strategy underscored the challenges of negotiating with North Korea, as Pyongyang repeatedly demanded security guarantees and sanctions relief before committing to nuclear disarmament. The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is deeply rooted in historical complexities. The division of Korea following World War II and the subsequent events laid the foundation for the region's enduring tensions. North Korea’s nuclear ambitions are a response to perceived security threats, particularly from the United States and South Korea. Efforts to curb these ambitions date back to the 1994 Agreed Framework of the Sixth Party Talks and various bilateral agreements yet none have successfully led to lasting denuclearization. The failure of the previous highlights negotiations and the need for a more comprehensive approach that goes beyond punitive measures. A denuclearised Korean Peninsula should be viewed as a structured pathway to sustainable peace, rather than an ultimatum from Pyongyang. This approach necessitates cooperation from South Korea, which has historically aimed to balance pressure through engagement in inter-Korean dialogue and economic cooperation. Denuclearization efforts face several formidable challenges. North Korea views its nuclear arsenal as essential for regime survival making disarmament negotiations particularly difficult. Pyongyang has asserted consistently that its nuclear weapons are not mere bargaining chips but integral to national defense. This perspective is reinforced by past instances where regimes abandoned nuclear ambitions—such as Libya—faced dire consequences. North Korean leadership's fears are similar and outcomes are unlikely to surrender to its nuclear capabilities without ironclad security assurances. These fears are exacerbated by shifting U.S. policies, which make it difficult to guarantee long-term commitments. The divergence of interests among major powers further complicates the situation. The United States employs a strategy of maximum pressure advocating strict military sanctions and deterrence. Japan aligns closely with this approach emphasizing the enforcement of sanctions internationally and supporting U.S.-led security measures. In contrast, South Korea prioritizes diplomatic engagement, economics, and cooperation, often pursuing inter-Korean initiatives that differ from the hardline stance of Washington and Tokyo. These differing strategies create inconsistencies in addressing North Korea and the reducing effectiveness of a unified international approach. Another major challenge is the risk of military escalation. The Korean Peninsula is one of the most militarized regions in the world, where any miscalculation could lead to devastating consequences. North Korea’s frequent military provocations and aggressive rhetoric increase the risk of conflict while joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises further escalate the tensions. The presence of U. S. military bases in Japan and South Korea also fuels Pyongyang’s hostility and its reinforcing justification for maintaining nuclear capabilities. Escalation, whether intentional or accidental, could trigger a broader conflict among multiple regional powers, making deterrence strategies a double-edged sword. Regional responses to North Korea’s nuclear ambitions add another layer of complexity. China as North Korea’s economic partner has interests in maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula. While Beijing officially opposes North Korea’s nuclear program it prioritizes stability over denuclearization fearing that the collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to refugee crises and the U.S. expansion of the military near its borders. China has supported sanctions but also has advocated diplomatic solutions and economic engagement. This dual dual approach reflects Beijing’s broader calculations strategy which often diverges from the hardline positions of the United States and Japan. Russia also plays a critical role in shaping regional dynamics. Moscow maintains diplomatic ties and economic relations with Pyongyang, positioning itself as a potential mediator in denuclearisation talks. Russia’s opposition to U.S. unilateral actions in the region aligns with its broader strategy of geopolitical countering of American influence. By engaging with North Korea Russia seeks to strengthen its role as a key player in East Asian security while challenging Western-led initiatives. These competing interests among major powers create obstacles forming to a cohesive international strategy complicating further efforts to resolve the nuclear crisis. The U.S.-Japan dialogue on North Korea’s nuclear threat highlights the complexities of achieving denuclearisation, not only for North Korea but for the entire Korean Peninsula. While Washington and Tokyo reaffirm their commitment to diplomatic solutions and regional stability the involvement of Russia, China, and South Korea introduces additional challenges that must carefully be navigated. The path to denuclearization requires a balanced multilateral approach that guarantees economic security incentives and strategic deterrence. The successful resolution will depend on sustained diplomatic engagement, internationally coordinated efforts, and a recognition that North Korea’s nuclear ambitions are tied deeply to regional concerns and security. Moving forward continued dialogue and cooperation among global stakeholders will be essential addressing in North Korea’s nuclear threat and ensuring long-term peace in East Asia.

Political Mehr: A Postmodern Vision Of Liberty And Community – Be...	A New Social and Political Model Political Mehr represents a postmodern governance framework that transcends modernity’s limitations while retaining its strengths. Unlike traditional models that prioritize either the state (socialism, authoritarian regimes) or the market (neoliberal capitalism), Mehr envisions a community-driven society where individual freedom, participatory governance, and economic cooperation coexist harmoniously. The failures of adversarial politics have left societies fragmented, deepening inequality and disillusionment. Political Mehr corrects these deficiencies by embedding direct civic participation into the governance structure, ensuring that the individual remains the central actor in shaping economic, political, and cultural life. A. Free Individuals as the Foundation of Society 1. Individual Freedom as the Core of Society Political Mehr rejects both authoritarian rule and collectivist subjugation, advocating for a governance model where individuals actively shape their own destinies. Unlike modern liberal democracies, which reduce political engagement to periodic elections, Mehr implements a system of continuous citizen participation in governance and economy. As Hannah Arendt argues, 'The political realm rises directly out of acting together, the sharing of words and deeds.' Mehr embodies this principle by ensuring every individual is directly involved in governance, rather than being a passive observer. To facilitate direct civic participation, Mehr establishes mandatory community involvement, requiring every citizen to contribute a minimum of 10 hours per month to governance. Decision-making is not left to career politicians but distributed across rotating leadership structures to prevent power monopolization. Additionally, Mehr integrates digital governance platforms, allowing real-time citizen voting, direct policy proposals, and immediate oversight of public funds. This system not only ensures political inclusivity but also safeguards against political elites consolidating control over decision-making processes. 2. The Community as a Platform, Not a Mechanism of Control Communities in Political Mehr function as spaces of collective empowerment rather than mechanisms of bureaucratic regulation. Unlike traditional centralized governance, which enforces compliance from above, Mehr encourages local self-governance through decentralized councils, ensuring all individuals have a direct stake in decision-making. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau states, 'The sovereignty of the people must be exercised continuously, not merely delegated to representatives.' Mehr materializes this idea by replacing the passivity of electoral democracy with a dynamic, participatory structure that allows for continuous governance by the people. To prevent abuses of power within decentralized communities, Mehr enforces: Strict term limits and leadership rotation mechanisms to prevent political stagnation. Citizen-led conflict resolution bodies, ensuring governance remains democratic and transparent. Centralized oversight on inclusivity, allowing the National Trust Fund to withhold resources fromcommunities that violate democratic principles. A public accountability framework, where all governance actions are auditable by citizens in real-time.These safeguards ensure that no local governing body becomes a mechanism of coercion, but instead remains a fluid and responsive structureB. The Market as a Tool, Not a MasterPolitical Mehr values markets as a means of economic coordination, but rejects the notion that market forces should dictate society. Unlike neoliberal capitalism, which views competition as the driver of progress, Mehr emphasizes economic cooperation and community-driven entrepreneurship. Karl Polanyi warned, 'To allow the market mechanism to be the sole director of human fate would result in the demolition of society.' Mehr acknowledges this, recognizing that unchecked markets generate monopolization, wealth concentration, and economic disenfranchisement. Instead, Mehr integrates community-based entrepreneurship incubators, ensuring that economic activity remains both competitive and cooperative. Communities provide shared infrastructure, mentorship, and financial resources to support innovation without the destructive elements of hyper-competition. By anchoring economic activity in local governance, Mehr ensures that prosperity does not accumulate within a wealthy elite, but remains distributed and accountable to the people. C. Managing the Transition from Traditional Systems to Political Mehr A major challenge in implementing Mehr is ensuring a smooth transition from traditional political and economic structures without destabilizing society. Instead of abrupt overhauls, Mehr proposes an incremental transition process: Pilot Communities: Select communities adopt Mehr's principles as test models, refining the system before nationwide implementation. Gradual Decentralization: The central government gradually transfers authority to community- based governance structures over a period of five to ten years. Educational Reforms: Governance training programs prepare citizens for direct participation, ensuring they possess the knowledge and skills necessary for self-governance. Economic Restructuring: The National Trust Fund provides financial autonomy to communities, ensuring they have the resources to function independently before full decentralization. Legal and Institutional Adaptation: Existing institutions are restructured rather than dismantled, ensuring continuity while integrating Mehr’s principles. This phased transition ensures that political instability is minimized, economic self-sufficiency is established, and citizens are fully prepared for participatory governance. D. Mehr as the Model for Global Change The contemporary world is experiencing political stagnation and economic disillusionment: Liberal democracies struggle to address economic disparity and political disengagement. Authoritarian regimes collapse under internal repression and external pressures. Capitalist economies generate extreme inequality, environmental destruction, and socialfragmentation. As Antonio Gramsci states, 'The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.' Mehr provides a clear alternative to both authoritarianism and neoliberal capitalism, offering a participatory, just, and community-driven framework. Mehr is not just an idea—it is a necessity. It provides: Freedom beyond elections: Every citizen directly participates in governance. Economic justice: Wealth is distributed to serve communities rather than corporate elites. Cultural empowerment: Preventing external forces from dictating societal identity. As Hannah Arendt reminds us, 'The only durable societies are those that give individuals a sense of meaning through their work and relationships.' Political Mehr restores meaning, freedom, and justice, offering a path forward for Iran, the WANA region, and beyond. References Arendt, H. (1958). The Human Condition. University of Chicago Press.

Why Trump’s Tariff War And Anti–Immigration Policy Are Unlikely T...	Currently, the USA is the prime trigger for India’s external economic growth. It is the biggest export destination of India. The trajectory of export growth is not sporadic. The USA pitted as the biggest importer of Indian merchandise continuously for over a decade. Even during Trump’s first period (2017-2020), overall growth in export was sustained, albeit Trump’s protectionism. Exports to USA bowed the seeds of progressive growth for India ‘s external economy year-by-year, largely balancing India’s big imports. Its share in India’s exports leaped from 12.4 percent in 2013-14 to 17.7 percent in 2023-24. To this end, India’s over-dependence on the USA signals alarming with Trump’s fierce tariff war and anti-immigration policy. Nevertheless, the situation is not as grim as it has been hyped. Factors attributed to the resilience are the export basket and indispensible qualitative Indian IT services at reasonable cost. The stunning growth in exports, arresting Trump’s hubris, attributes to product characteristics in the export basket. They are diamonds, readymade garments, textiles, drugs and pharmaceuticals and petroleum refinery products. In most of these products in the export basket, Trump’s high tariffs could prove as a boomerang, leaving American consumers facing higher prices. For example, diamonds and semiprecious stones, textiles and readymade garments are those products, which account for nearly one-fifth of India’s export basket to the USA. In none of these product groups, USA investors are either keen to invest or have skills to produce at a competitive price. Penetration of Indian diamonds depends upon human capacity, which needs many years of experience of artisans. India is known as the global hub for cutting and polishing of small diamonds. They produce high quality well-cut diamonds at a low labour cost with diverse ranges in shape, sizes and grades. Indian garments are popular in USA due to combination of factors like intricate design , skilled craftsmanship, low prices, large variety of styles and growing ethnic design and fashions. Indian garments are preferred over Vietnamese and Chinese garments because of their intricate patterns, embroidery and diverse fabrics like silk and cotton, reflecting a rich cultural heritage. Oil refinery products and drugs and pharmaceuticals account for larger shares in total exports of India to USA. In 2023-24, they accounted for about 19 percent for total exports of India to USA. Indian oil refinery products are preferred in USA against others because of their affordability, owing to cheap Russian oil. After sanction, Russian crude was priced to India at US $ 60 per barrel, as compared to global price of US$80 to $90 per barrel. Evidently, the past experience of Trump’s protectionism will sway the threat. During his first term (2017-20), withdrawal of Special Status under the GSP scheme (Generalized System of Preference) and imposition of high tariffs on steel and aluminum, failed to dwarf exports from India. Incidentally, over the period GSP benefits lost luster it accounted for 2 percent of India’s exports to USA. India is currently the third biggest exporter of pharmaceutical products and fourth biggest exporter of readymade garments in the USA market. In 2022, it accounted for 5.5 percent of total imports of pharmaceutical products and in 2023, and accounted for 7 percent in total imports of readymade garments in the USA market. For generic drugs Americans rely on standard prescriptions like antibiotics, which are predominantly sourced from developing nations where production costs are low, according to Coalition for a Prosperous America. Nevertheless, India has an edge over China. Notwithstanding, China being the biggest supplier of readymade garments and drugs and pharmaceuticals to the USA, a higher import tariff on China will give an edge to India. This will lend advantage to India to cut a share of Chinese market in the USA. To this end, higher import tariffs on China could be a lease of life to Indian exporters to counter-balance the impact of a 10 percent hike in import tariffs on Indian products. The collapse of Bangladesh government will be another factor for India to tide over the tariff affected garment exports. Bangladesh is the third biggest exporter of garments in the USA market, sharing about 11 percent of imports of garments. India cut a big pie in export of IT services to the USA. In 2023, India’s export of IT software to USA was US$32O billion. It accounted for 55.5 percent of total software exports from India. Restriction on immigration looms big threat to India’s export of software. India is the biggest beneficiary of H1B visas. Annually, more than 70 percent of H1B visas are issued to Indians. But, there is another side of restriction on immigration, which may prove benign to India. It may increase USA investment in India. USA IT firms, who were more dependent on India for cost effective services, could open branches in India for off-shore services. During Trump’s first term, USA FDI in India soared. It made a big leap from US$2.2 billion in 2017 to US$14.3 billion in 2020. The big IT and financial services companies, such as Intel and Morgan Stanley, made bulk investments in India. Currently, nearly 44 percent of US investment in India embraces computer software and hardware (mainly software).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQ7EBrD2FVURsJh51FAnYE	2025-02-10T08:55:06-08:00

Dilemmas In The Policy Debate On Autonomous Weapon Systems – Anal...	By Dr Alexander Blanchard, Dr Vincent Boulanin, Laura Bruun and Netta Goussac It is more than 10 years since the first multilateral policy debate took place on whether and how to regulate autonomous weapon systems (AWS). And for most of the past decade, formal discussions on AWS have been limited to groups of experts under the auspices of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). However, a growing number of stakeholders have voiced dissatisfaction with the CCW process. There has been pressure from various sides for the policy debate on AWS to be diversified—both in terms of where it should take place (many argue that taking the debate to alternative multilateral forums could accelerate progress towards an international regulatory instrument) and of what the debate should focus on, given technological and geostrategic developments since 2014. However, diversifying the policy process implies several trade-offs. This essay highlights some of those trade-offs and helps policymakers consider their potential implications for international efforts to regulate AWS. The AWS debate spreads beyond the CCW The AWS debate has already started to spread to forums outside the Geneva-based CCW. In 2023, the Netherlands hosted the first international Summit on Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain (REAIM), where AWS was widely discussed. Also in 2023, debate in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly culminated in the first UN resolution on AWS, requesting the UN Secretary-General to collect and report states’ views on the topic. Since 2023, diplomatic talks on regulating AWS and related military artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have happened along three concurrent tracks: at the CCW group of governmental experts on lethal autonomous weapon systems (GGE on LAWS); at the REAIM Summit (with South Korea hosting the second summit in September 2024); and in the First Committee (which adopted a second resolution on AWS in October 2024 requesting the Secretary-General to facilitate formal consultations on AWS in the General Assembly). The First Committee also adopted a resolution on responsible AI in the military domain that has implications for some types of AWS. In addition, like-minded states can participate voluntarily in governance initiatives associated with the 2023 United States Political Declaration on Responsible Military AI. All this raises a number of questions, not the least of which are: how will these processes overlap, complement or compete with one another? And how should states and organizations allocate institutional resources and efforts between these different tracks? Answering these questions is complicated by the fact that different actors have different ideas of what constitutes success. Hence, a third question is what the overall goal of the AWS policy process ought to be. The current mandate of the GGE on LAWS is to formulate ‘by consensus, a set of elements of an instrument, without prejudging its nature’ for regulating AWS. Many want this instrument, if agreed on, to be legally binding—for example, a new protocol to the CCW. There are also widely varying expectations about what such an instrument should cover. In addition, there are outcomes other than a legally binding instrument on the table, such as a manual on the application of international humanitarian law (IHL) in relation to AWS or the establishment of a standing group of technical experts. It is also possible that states will simply continue to address AWS issues at the national level, in light of their existing obligations under international law. Rationales behind the calls to diversify the AWS debate. A key factor pushing calls to diversify the AWS policy process is the perceived limitations of the CCW. While the GGE on LAWS has played a crucial role in the international discourse on AWS and has achieved some convergence among states on a possible ‘normative and operational framework’, it has long faced criticism on several grounds. These relate to its focus on IHL to the exclusion of other aspects of AWS, including ethics and security issues; its smaller membership and participation relative to other forums; its narrow focus on AWS when other technologies pose similar challenges; and its consensus-based procedural rules. Exclusive focus on international humanitarian law While the CCW—an instrument of IHL—provides a crucial framework for addressing the challenges associated with the use of AWS, some argue that it means the GGE on LAWS does not fully capture the range of legal, ethical and security implications posed by AWS. For instance, stakeholders have raised questions about the human rights implications of AWS use, the potential for AWS use to lead to unintended escalation, and the impact of AWS possession on strategic stability. The continued emphasis on IHL issues in the GGE on LAWS has left many stakeholders desiring a forum in which other concerns can be given more consideration. Lack of Inclusiveness The GGE on LAWS has also been criticized for a perceived lack of inclusiveness. Many have argued for taking intergovernmental deliberation outside of the GGE in order to ensure that a wider range of voices are heard. One line of argument is that too many states are left out of the debate, as the CCW has only 127 high contracting parties and four signatories, compared with the UN General Assembly’s 193 member states and two non-member state observers. The CCW process has also been criticized for excluding non-government voices. For example, over the years some states have tried to make the participation of civil society groups at the GGE on LAWS more difficult, for example excluding them from certain sessions. In this respect the GGE on LAWS is often contrasted with REAIM, which bills itself as ‘a platform for global discussion with all stakeholders’ of military AI. However, this comparison may be unfair, since REAIM has no authority to make law. Narrow focus on AWS A key rationale that has been advanced for diversifying the policy process is the concerns raised by broader military applications of AI. The CCW debate on AWS has historically focused on weapons systems that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further human intervention. However, some have argued that a number of other technologies raise similar legal, ethical, humanitarian and security concerns, and thus fall within the GGE on LAWS’s mandate to cover ‘emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon systems’. One example is the use of AI-enabled decision-support systems (DSS) to inform targeting decisions, as Israel has reportedly done in Gaza. However, while the GGE on LAWS has not adopted a formal definition of AWS, the characterization of AWS included in its current rolling text would not cover advancements such as AI-enabled DSS. The consensus-based model One of the most prominent criticisms of the GGE on LAWS is that its consensus-based model has allowed some participants to block progress towards a substantial outcome, particularly for agreeing on elements of a potential legally binding instrument. Achieving consensus among states with diverse interests and perspectives can be challenging, especially on complex and sensitive issues like AWS. It is especially difficult in today’s tense and polarized geopolitical context. By contrast, the UN General Assembly can adopt decisions by a two-thirds majority. Indeed, the overwhelming support for the two General Assembly resolutions on AWS has been taken by some as proof that the CCW process is allowing a handful of states to block the development of a treaty that the majority appear to urgently want. Potential trade-offs While there may be compelling reasons to diversify the AWS policy process in terms of forum and content, policymakers need to carefully consider and balance some potential trade-offs. These can be broadly categorized as comprehensiveness versus focus; diffusion versus duplication; diversification versus political buy-in; and inclusiveness versus efficiency. Comprehensiveness versus focus There are potential drawbacks to broadening the scope of the CCW debate on AWS to include a breadth of other military applications of AI. States do not yet agree about how to define AWS. It took time to develop an informal ‘working characterization’ of AWS within the GGE on LAWS, and this characterization focuses on weapons that, once activated, can identify, select and engage targets without human intervention. Introducing technologies such as AI-enabled DSS to the conversation could potentially reopen the question of characterization and could take the GGE on LAWS back to square one. A similar risk also applies to generally expanding the range of AWS challenges that are to be considered in addition to IHL, whether in the GGE on LAWS or another forum. Broadening the scope of the debate—to take in, for example, human rights law or escalation risks—will mean either devoting more time to discussions or keeping them on a more superficial level. It may also present resourcing issues for some states. Policymakers need to seek the right balance between comprehensiveness and focus to ensure that the international debate on AWS is effective and relevant. Diffusion versus duplication Spreading the debate on regulating AWS to several forums might create resilience by fostering alternative pathways towards an instrument if the CCW process proves inconclusive. But doing so might also bring new uncertainties, including the risk that different processes will duplicate effort or lead to incompatible outcomes. Also, any other process may well be subject to the same geopolitical constraints and compromises that influence deliberations in the GGE on LAWS. Thus the potential benefits of maintaining parallel processes need to be balanced against the risk that the substantial effort, resources and time they demand might ultimately be wasted. In view of this, states must be clear-eyed about what is to be desired and expected from any given process. Diversification versus political buy-in Including a greater diversity of stakeholders, or simply moving the debate to additional forums, could reduce some states’ political buy-in to the processes and, as a consequence, to any outcomes from them. For one thing, participating states have argued that as the CCW was previously selected as the legitimate forum for discussing the regulation of AWS, the GGE on LAWS should, at the very least, be allowed to complete its current mandate, which expires in 2026, before starting parallel processes. They have also displayed a general aversion to prejudging the success of the GGE process. Indeed, many states may see the current level of participation of the GGE on LAWS, the limited scope of its discussions, and its requirement for consensus as advantages. The GGE on LAWS also has a larger value beyond the regulation of AWS, being one of the few remaining forums where major powers still discuss arms control issues. Any agreement on regulating AWS would have limited efficacy if it did not attract buy-in from the large military powers. It is noteworthy that China chose to abstain on the 2024 First Committee resolution on responsible AI in the military domain. Inclusiveness versus efficiency Another possible downside of making the AWS policy debate more inclusive is how it could slow and complicate the process. For example, the more participants there are, the more difficult it could be to reach agreement. More generally, it is likely to make debates and other processes longer. Participants will come to the debate with varying levels of knowledge and engagement and different understandings of the issues involved. It could thus take more time and effort to ensure that they are all on the same page. There is also a risk that trying to make discussions as broadly accessible as possible could prevent them from going into sufficient depth and detail. No easy answers The multilateral process on AWS is at a critical juncture, with frustration mounting at the slow rate of progress in the GGE on LAWS and its limited participation and scope. However, policymakers considering the various calls to continue diversifying the process must weigh up the benefits and possible trade-offs involved. Autonomous weapons systems raise profound questions about the human role in the use of force. How those questions get answered on the international stage, or whether they get answered at all, currently hangs in the balance.

The Hidden Cost Of Mongolia’s Mining Boom – Analysis	By Narantuya Chuluunbat Mongolia’s burgeoning mining sector is a cornerstone of its economy. But it comes with inherent challenges, including environmental degradation, income inequality and community displacement. Mongolia’s policymakers must navigate the trade-offs between boosting economic growth by exploiting natural resources and preserving environmental integrity. The mining sector accounted for 28.7 per cent of Mongolia’s GDP, 92.1 per cent of exports and 31.6 per cent of fiscal revenue in 2023 — one of the highest among resource-rich countries. The sector directly employed 73,180 people in 2023 — 5.7 per cent of total employment — and an estimated 60,000 in small-scale artisanal mining, a substantial source of employment in rural areas. Mining also supports numerous indirect jobs through related industries and services. One of the primary environmental concerns is the depletion of water reserves. This is especially salient in the South Gobi region of Mongolia, where large mines account for 78.3 per cent of regional water use in an already water-scarce area. Mining uses 15 per cent of the country’s total water, and demand is expected to rise 2.4-fold by 2040, outstripping underground water reserves. The extraction process also significantly contributes to soil erosion and land degradation. In Mongolia, roughly 72 per cent of the land is degraded, with an estimated 100,000 hectares affected by coal and gold mining. Mining has disrupted the livelihoods of nomadic herders, leading to displacement and loss of grazing land. Agriculture employs 27.9 per cent of the country’s labour force, and animal husbandry is the sole source of livelihood for 62.2 per cent of rural households. The sector currently contributes 9.8 per cent of GDP, down from 27.4 per cent in 2000. As such, this structural shift has favoured mining at the considerable expense of agriculture. Since the early 2000s, clashes between mining companies and herders over land and water use have intensified, prompting the introduction of Local-Level Agreements (LLAs) into law. Several hundred LLAs have been established over the past decade. The Oyu Tolgoi South Gobi Agreement is a notable example. Herders’ concerns with the Oyu Tolgoi mining project included the loss of pastureland, dust from road traffic harming livestock health, risks associated with unfenced quarries and anxiety over underground water use depleting local water. The Oyu Tolgoi South Gobi Agreement involved local populations in negotiations and resulted in a mutually agreeable resolution through a layered, ongoing dialogue. But the Oyu Tolgoi South Gobi Agreement is an exception rather than the rule. Mongolia’s legal framework for LLAs is overly prescriptive and does not recognise the affected communities as true negotiating parties. This limits meaningful participation by the affected local community in the agreement-making process, leading to short-term agreements that are often too broad, do not address specific concerns and are not monitored to ensure implementation. LLAs are an integral part of the ‘social licence to operate’ concept, an essential tool for community engagement with mining projects. The social licence to operate concept emphasises securing genuine community approval for mining projects. In Mongolia, community opposition has led to delays, disruptions and even the shutdown of mining operations, highlighting the importance of securing and maintaining this social licence to avoid costly consequences. The importance of preserving nomadic pastoralism goes beyond negotiating the coexistence of mining and herders. Nomadic pastoralism is an essential source of economic diversification, an ongoing goal and challenge for successive Mongolian governments. Improving economic diversification becomes ever more pressing as the mining sector grows exponentially, but it remains little more than wishful thinking. Still, the current shift in global consumer preferences and emerging Asian markets provide Mongolia with an opportunity to cater to niche markets with high-quality products. In addition to a resilient cashmere sector, there has been a recent surge in large companies’ investment in meat production and a considerable expansion of meat exports. Quality is a selling point, so preserving pastures will be essential to distinguish Mongolian animal products from those of competitors. The government has made significant strides in developing environmental regulations to ensure sustainable mining practices and align Mongolia’s mining laws to global standards. Mongolian law requires mining projects undergo rigorous environmental assessments. Unfortunately, the new environmental regulations remain effective only on paper. Enforcement remains weak, and stronger compliance and more frequent regulation updates are needed to improve the effectiveness of Mongolia’s environmental regulations. The mining sector can still be efficient under strict environmental regulations if advanced technology is used and adequate infrastructure is in place. But this is not the case in Mongolia because the government has focused on raising fiscal revenue and made limited efforts to improve infrastructure. A strategic, forward-looking approach to ensuring the sector’s sustainabilitydemands that Mongolia’s policymakers invest in infrastructure while boosting the enforcement of the existing environmental regulations. This dual task is long overdue and will level up the entire mining–environment game. Government regulations alone will not preserve Mongolia’s environment. At the local level, resource companies must be expected to negotiate effectively and reach an agreement with multiple stakeholders. Genuine and meaningful local engagement is essential to addressing the growing problem of pasture degradation. Herders can find powerful allies in animal product processing companies, as they have shared interests in safeguarding the health of Mongolia’s animals and the environment.

Renewed Ukrainian Offensive In Kursk – Analysis	By Luke Coffey While most of the fighting between Ukraine and Russia has occurred on the former’s land, significant military operations have also taken place in Russian territory.In August last year, Ukraine surprised the world by launching a military offensive targeting Russia’s Kursk Oblast, a region located across the border from the sizable city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainian troops crossed into Kursk and caught Russian forces off guard. At the peak of their control, the Ukrainian forces held about 1,000 sq. km of Russian territory.This week marks the six-month anniversary of the operation in Kursk. It is reported that Ukraine has launched another military operation there this week and has already made minor gains. The importance of the timing of such an operation cannot be overstated. As President Donald Trump settles into the White House and begins strategizing how he might bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, officials in Kyiv will undoubtedly want to approach any talks from a position of strength.Many Western commentators were skeptical of Ukraine’s bold move into Kursk last year. The prevailing wisdom at the time suggested the troops and armored vehicles could have been better utilized along critical front lines inside Ukraine, where Russian forces continued to occupy Ukrainian territory.However, the foray into Kursk proved to be a brilliant maneuver for several reasons. It came at a time when many of Ukraine’s Western supporters were questioning its ability to achieve success on the battlefield. Entering Russia and seizing control of territory there demonstrated to Kyiv’s partners that when properly equipped and trained, its forces could achieve significant military gains. This was a crucial morale booster at a time when doubts about Ukrainian military capabilities were growing.The move into Kursk also forced Russia to divert soldiers, equipment, and resources that could have been deployed elsewhere along the front lines. This alleviated pressure on some of Ukraine’s most challenging defensive positions and gave its forces some much-needed breathing room.Ukraine’s decision to enter Kursk also served as a strategic communications effort aimed at highlighting Russia’s hypocrisy regarding minority and language rights. Historically, the area that is now Kursk Oblast was heavily populated by ethnic Ukrainians, and Ukrainian was the dominant language. Although the demographic composition has shifted over the centuries, social media footage from the battlefield showed Ukrainian soldiers casually chatting in Ukrainian with Russian inhabitants of the region.Given that Russia often justifies its military interventions by claiming to be protecting ethnic Russians outside its borders, the Ukrainian occupation of Kursk was a powerful way to expose the flaws in Moscow’s argument.However, the most important reason for Ukraine’s decision to launch an operation inside Russia was strategic geopolitical diplomacy. In August, it was still unclear who would win the US presidential election in November but the political trends suggested Trump had a strong chance of victory. Given his insistence on the campaign trail that he would secure a negotiated settlement to end the war, Ukrainian leaders and military planners were probably concerned that Moscow would push for a ceasefire that froze the front lines in place as new borders. By holding territory inside of Russia, Kyiv ensured that these front lines could not simply be frozen in place. This would be unacceptable to Moscow because it could not allow Ukrainian forces to remain inside its borders.In retrospect, the move into Kursk was a stroke of strategic genius by the Ukrainian leadership. The country’s control of Russian territory during any negotiations that take place will not only be critical but also historic. Since the days of Ivan the Terrible in the 1500s, Russia has been forced to negotiate peace while part of its own land was under foreign control on only four occasions, the most recent of which was more than a century ago. Had Ukraine failed to advance on Kursk and establish control over Russian land, it would have been in a much weaker position in any future negotiations.That is not to say everything has gone smoothly for Ukraine. A major military operation in Kursk required trade-offs, including the diversion of resources from other critical front line areas. While Moscow was, as noted, forced to redeploy troops to defend Kursk it has also made minor, but tactically significant, advances elsewhere, particularly in Donetsk.Additionally, Russia has managed to bring North Korea into the conflict. Reports indicate that about 10,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to support Russian forces in Kursk. Although casualty rates among both the Russian and North Korean troops have been high, they have managed to retake about 40 percent of the land Ukraine initially seized.To a figure such as President Vladimir Putin, however, even a single square meter of Russian territory under foreign control is unacceptable. He gave his forces two deadlines to take back Kursk: initially he wanted it done by Oct. 1 and then he extended it to Feb. 1. Both dates have come and gone and the Ukrainians are still in control of territory there.The timing of this week’s renewed Ukrainian offensive in Kursk is therefore critical. By putting additional pressure on Russian forces and attempting to capture even more territory, Ukraine is ensuring that it will begin any peace negotiations in the strongest possible position.Trump has tasked his special envoy, Keith Kellogg, with securing a peace deal within 100 days. It has been reported that the Trump administration will outline more details of its peace plan during the Munich Security Conference next week. Therefore, the renewed military operations in Kursk could not have come at a better time for Kyiv.The coming weeks will be pivotal. If Ukraine can expand its control inside Russian territory, it will fundamentally reshape the dynamics of any negotiations. If Russia successfully repels the Ukrainian forces, Moscow will have a stronger hand in any settlement.What is certain, however, is that Ukraine’s ability to maintain a presence inside Russian borders will remain a crucial factor in the high-stakes diplomatic process expected to unfold in the months ahead. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3buQAbphW6klGP	2025-02-08T17:24:02-08:00	
The Most Dramatic Narrative Shift In Modern History – OpEd	The most dramatic narrative shift in this post-lockdown period has been the flip in the perceptions of government itself. For decades and even centuries, government was seen as the essential bulwark to defend the poor, empower the marginalized, realize justice, even the playing field in commerce, and guarantee rights to all. Government was the wise manager, curbing the excess of populist enthusiasm, blunting the impact of ferocious market dynamics, guaranteeing the safety of products, breaking up dangerous pockets of wealth accumulation, and protecting the rights of minority populations. That was the ethos and the perception. Taxation itself was sold to the population for centuries as the price we pay for civilization, a slogan emblazoned in marble at the DC headquarters of the IRS and attributed to Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who said this in 1904, ten years before the federal income tax was even legal in the US. This claim was not just about a method of funding; it was a commentary on the perceived merit of the whole of the public sector. Yes, this view had challengers on the right and left but their radical critiques rarely took hold of the public mind in a sustained way. A strange thing happened in 2020. Most governments at all levels across the globe turned on their people. It was a shock because governments had never before attempted anything this audacious. It claimed to be exercising mastery over the whole of the microbial kingdom, the world over. It would prove this implausible mission as a valid one with the release of a magic potion made and distributed with its industrial partners who were fully indemnified against liability claims. Suffice it to say that the potion did not work. Everyone got Covid anyway. Most everyone shook it off. Those who died were often denied common therapeutics to make way for a shot that clocked the highest rate of injury and death on public record. A worse fiasco would be hard to invent outside dystopian fiction. Participating in this grand crusade were all the commanding heights. That included mass media, academia, the medical industry, the information systems, and science itself. After all, the very notion of 'public health' itself implies a 'whole of government' and a 'whole of society' effort. Indeed, science – with its high status earned from many centuries of achievement – led the way. The politicians – the people for whom the public votes and who form the one real connection that the people have with the regimes under which they live – went along but did not seem to be in the driver’s seat. Nor did the courts seem to have much role. They were closed along with small businesses, schools, and houses of worship. The controlling forces in every nation traced to something else we did not normally think of as government. It was the administrators who occupied agencies that were deemed independent of public awareness or control. They worked closely with their industrial partners in tech, pharma, banking, and corporate life. The Constitution did not matter. Neither did the long tradition of rights, liberty, and law. The workforce was divided between essential and nonessential in order to survive the great emergency. The essential people were the ruling class plus the workers who serve them. Everyone else was deemed unessential to social functioning. It was supposed to be for our health – government merely looking after us – but this claim lost credibility quickly, as mental and physical health plummeted. Desperate loneliness replaced community. Loved ones were forcibly separated. The aged died alone with digital funerals. Weddings and worship were cancelled. Gyms were closed and then opened later only for the masked and the vaxxed. The arts died. Substance abuse skyrocketed because while everything else was closed the liquor stores and pot shops were open for business. Here was when perceptions dramatically changed. Government was not what we thought. It is something else. It does not serve the public. It serves its own interests. Those interests are deeply woven into the fabric of industry and civil society. The agencies are captured. The largesse flows mainly to the well-connected. The bills are paid by the people who had been deemed nonessential and who were now being compensated for the troubles with direct payments that were created by a printing press. Within a year, this showed up in the form of inflation that dramatically reduced real income during an economic crisis. This huge experiment in pharmacological planning ended up flipping the rubrical narrative that had largely covered public affairs for everyone’s lifetimes. The terrible reality was being broadcast to the whole population in ways no one had ever before experienced. Centuries of philosophy and rhetoric were being shredded before our eyes, as whole populations came face-to-face with the unthinkable: government had become a grand scam or even criminal enterprise, a machinery that served only elite plans and elite institutions. As it turns out, generations of ideological philosophizing had been chasing fictional rabbits. This is true for all the main debates about socialism and capitalism but also the side debates about religion, demographics, climate change, and so much more. Nearly everyone had been distracted from seeing the things that matter by hunting for things that did not actually matter. This realization transversed typical partisan and ideological boundaries. Those who did not like to think about issues of class conflict had to face the ways in which the whole system was serving one class at the expense of everyone else. The cheerleaders of government beneficence faced the unthinkable: their true love had become malevolent. The champions of private enterprise had to deal with the ways in which private corporations participated and benefited from the entire fiasco. All major political parties and their journalistic backers participated. No one’s ideological priors were confirmed in the course of events, and everyone was forced to realize that the world worked in a very different way from what we had been told. Most governments in the world had come to be controlled by people no one elected and these administrative forces were loyal not to voters but to industrial interests in media and pharma, while the intellectuals we had long trusted to say what is true went along with even the craziest of claims, while condemning dissent. Making matters more confusing, no one in charge of this disaster would admit error or even explain their thinking. The burning questions were and are so voluminous as to be impossible to list in full. In the US, there was supposed to be a Covid commission but it never formed. Why? Because the critics far outweighed the apologists, and a public commission proved too risky. Too much truth could get out, and then what would happen? Behind the public health rationale for the destruction, there was a hidden hand: national security interests rooted in the bioweapons industry that has long lived under a classified cover. This is likely what accounts for the strange taboo concerning this whole topic. Those who know cannot say while the rest of us who have been researching this for years are left with more questions than answers. While we wait for a full accounting of how it is that rights and liberties were crushed worldwide – what Javier Milei has called a 'crime against humanity' – there is no denying the reality on the ground. There was certain to be a blowback, the ferocity of which would only intensify the longer justice is delayed. For several years, the world had awaited the political, economic, cultural, and intellectual fallout, while the perpetrators held on hoping that the whole subject would just go away. Forget about Covid, they kept saying to us, and yet the sheer size and scale of the calamity would not go away. We live in the midst of that now, with minute-by-minute revelations of where the money went and who precisely was involved. Multiple trillions were squandered as the people’s standard of living took a dive, and now top among the burning questions is: who got the money? Careers are being wrecked as famous anti-corporate crusaders like Bernie Sanders turn out to be the US Senate’s largest single beneficiary of pharma largesse, exposed for the world. The Sanders story is just one data point of millions. The news of the sheer number of rackets is spilling out like an avalanche minute-by-minute. The newspapers we thought were chronicling public life turned out to be on the take. The fact-checkers were always working for the blob. The censors were only protecting themselves. The inspectors we believed were keeping an eye out were always in on the game. The courts keeping tabs on government overreach were enabling it. The bureaucracies tagged to implement legislation were unchecked and unelected legislatures in themselves. The shift is beautifully illustrated by USAID, a $50 billion agency that claimed to be doing humanitarian work but which was really a slush fund for regime change, deep-state operations, censorship, and NGO graft on a scale never before seen. Now we have the receipts. The entire agency, lording over the globe like an unchecked colossus for decades, seems destined for the trash heap. And so on it goes. Frequently overlooked in all the commentary on our times is how the second Trump administration is Republican in name only but mostly consists of refugees from the other party. Tick through the names (Trump, Vance, Musk, Kennedy, Gabbard, and so on) and you find people who only a few years ago were associated with the Democratic Party. Which is to say that this aggressive rooting out of the deep state is being achieved by what is a de facto third party aimed at overthrowing the establishments of the legacy ones. And this is not just in the US: the same dynamic is taking shape throughout the industrialized world. The entire system of government – properly conceived of not as a democratically elected conduit of the peoples’ interest but instead a complicated and unelected network of unfathomable industrial racketeering with a ruling class at the controls – seems to be unraveling before our eyes. It’s like the old episodes of Scooby-Doo when the scary ghost or mysterious specter has the mask removed and it is the town mayor all along, who then proclaims that he would have gotten away with it but for these meddling kids. The meddling kids now include vast swaths of the world’s population, burning with a passionate desire to clean up the public sector, expose the industrial scams, unearth all the secrets that have been kept for decades, put power back into the hands of the people as the liberal age promised long ago, while seeking justice for all the wrongdoing of these last hellish five years. The Covid operation was an audacious global attempt to deploy all the power of government – in all the directions from and to which it flowed – in service of a goal never before attempted in history. To say that it failed is the understatement of the century. What it did was unleash fires of fury the world over, and whole legacy systems are in the process of burning down. How deep is the corruption? There are no words to describe its breadth and depth. Who is regretting this? It’s the legacy news media, the legacy academic establishment, the legacy corporate establishment, the legacy public-sector agencies, the legacy everything, and this regret knows no partisan or ideological bounds. And who is celebrating this or, at least, enjoying the upheaval and cheering it on? It’s the independent media, the genuine grassroots, the deplorables and nonessentials, the pillaged and oppressed, the workers and peasants who were forced to serve the elites for years, those who have been truly marginalized through decades of exclusion from public life. No one can be sure where this ends up – and no revolution or counterrevolution in history is without cost or complication – but this much is true: public life will never be the same for generations to come.

Trump Issues Executive Order On Crypto And Central Bank Digital C...	By Peter Jacobsen Trump’s first weeks in office have involved a flurry of executive orders. Some have been dramatic, such as the federal government hiring freeze. Other orders have been toothless or vague, such as the order telling federal agencies that they need to do what is in their power to lower prices. But Trump’s EO on cryptocurrency is the one that caught my eye. It’s titled: 'Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology'—but what does that actually mean? The executive order has two main components: one relating to decentralized cryptocurrency and one relating to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). According to the order’s stated purpose: The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership. It is therefore the policy of [the Trump] Administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology, and related technologies across all sectors of the economy. As with most government policies, the language sounds positive. Who doesn’t want America to innovate and grow? But reading more closely might give you pause. Some of the content is in fact positive. For example, the order requires federal agencies to allow citizens to 'participate in mining and validating, to transact with other persons without unlawful censorship, and to maintain self-custody of digital assets.' Mining is the process by which new crypto tokens are generated. The process varies, but for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, mining involves using a computer to solve increasingly complex math problems. The ability to mine is especially important since mining has been politically targeted by extreme environmental groups as a waste of energy. Eventually, the math problems associated with mining become so difficult, computers will be unable to mine any more Bitcoin, making the supply finite. Allowing individuals to mine is central to the crypto concept. Furthermore, establishing protection for maintaining self-custody of digital assets, keeping them out of the range of unlawful seizures, is one of the most important aspects of cryptocurrency. The order also seeks to '[protect] and [promote] fair and open access to banking services for all law-abiding individual citizens and private-sector entities alike.' This clause reaches beyond crypto to traditional savings, and is particularly timely due to an increase in politically-influenced debanking of consumers (which occurred with the trucker protesters in Canada). There are, however, concerning aspects of the order on the cryptocurrency front. For example, the order also states that the executive branch should: [provide] regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent decision-making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries, all of which are essential to supporting a vibrant and inclusive digital economy and innovation in digital assets, permissionless blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies. While I prefer clear regulations to vague directives, I also prefer currency innovation that is regulated by users rather than by bureaucrats. Time will tell exactly what the regulatory framework will look like. Tackling CBDCs While the order has upsides and downsides concerning current crypto policies, the parts of the order I’m most excited about are the portions on Central Bank Digital Currencies, or CBDCs. A CBDC is essentially a government-created centrally controlled version of cryptocurrency. As FEE has discussed in the past, CBDCs are a very dangerous idea, and it was troubling that they were being pursued by the Biden administration. So what does the Trump executive order say about them? Take a look: [The Trump administration is] taking measures to protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States, including by prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States. Section 5 of the order covers how this will be done. By the order, it’s now illegal for bureaucrats within government agencies to pursue any plans to establish a CBDC unless it is required by law. In other words, barring the possibility that some bureaucrats could break the law, CBDC initiatives must immediately end unless the legislature passes bills requiring them. This is a big step because the establishment of a CBDC would require significant political, bureaucratic, and technological infrastructure to be implemented. Trump’s order puts a pause on the building of that infrastructure which began under Biden. On net, Trump’s order seems to have been taken well by crypto markets, with Bitcoin seeing a small price surge after the announcement of the order. So while the future of government crypto regulation remains unclear, the new administration’s commitment to stopping CBDCs and protecting the rights of those engaging in crypto mining and transactions seems to be a good sign.

Righting Wrongs With The Stroke Of A Presidential Pen – OpEd	The pens of U.S. Presidents have extraordinary power. How much power they have can be seen in the short history of a small agency within the office of the U.S. President. That history began in 2013 when the U.S. government launched the most visible website ever: Healthcare.gov. Spawned by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the site had been in development for three years. It was critical for President Obama’s plan to establish a monopoly digital marketplace as the only place Americans could access subsidized health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Millions of Americans tried to sign up for coverage on the day it launched, and it crashed. It was a digital disaster that dragged on for weeks and months. To fix the very visible problem it became, President Obama turned to a 'small team of America’s best digital experts.' After several months of effort, their work made the site and its supporting databases functional. Recognizing the talent of those digital experts, President Obama soon found more ways they could impact government operations. On August 11, 2014, he created the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) with a stroke of his pen. The USDS’s purpose was 'to improve the usefulness and reliability of the country’s most important digital services.' The USDS Is Redeployed In 2017, President Trump redeployed the USDS to fix another very visible digital problem. Websites and databases operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs to help veterans get timely appointments for health care at VA facilities weren’t up to the task. Veterans in need of treatment had to wait weeks and months to get appointments. The USDS went to work and succeeded in getting the waiting time for veterans to get appointments down to a matter of days. In 2025, the USDS is still pursuing its original mission. Only now, it is focusing on the usefulness and reliability of the country’s most important digital services related to the spending of taxpayer dollars, as it has once again been redeployed. With a stroke of his pen, President Trump renamed it and refocused its efforts. It is still the USDS, but now that it stands for 'United States DOGE Service,' where DOGE is the acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency. It’s already achieving significant results. A prime example is the fast-moving collapse of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a clearinghouse for disbursing foreign aid established by a stroke of President Kennedy’s pen in 1961. USAID’s Haystack of Wasteful Spending For years, USAID’s bureaucrats have served up a growing list of examples of its wasteful spending.Senator Rand Paul’s 2024 'Festivus' report prominently featured USAID’s spending of $20 million to produce 'Ahlan Simsim', a clone of the Sesame Street children’s show, for Iraq. Of course, Iraq is an oil-rich nation with a GDP of $250 billion in 2023 and whose government expects revenues exceeding $37 billion this year. If the people of Iraq really want a Sesame Street knockoff, they can completely fund it themselves. No U.S. foreign aid was needed for that purpose, but they got a $20 million check for it anyway. That’s a small amount of money in the grand scheme of U.S. foreign aid. Still, it is also just one of many such episodes in which USAID’s spending worked to contradict U.S. national interests. Like the straw that broke the camel’s back, the accumulation of straws does the damage. USAID’s bureaucrats spent years building a large haystack full of examples of wasteful spending. At a minimum, the agency was in need of substantial reform to make U.S. financial aid to foreign nations more effective. Having its responsibilities absorbed by the Department of State is a major step toward achieving much needed reform. Multiply that need for spending reform across multiple government agencies, and you will start to understand the scale of the problems caused by excessive government spending. Establishing more control and restraint over the growth of that spending is essential to righting much that iswrong with how the U.S. government operates today. That’s become the core mission of the USDS. All it took was a stroke of a President’s pen to make it so.

Trump’s Campaign To Cut USAID May Have A Silver Lining – OpEd	By Kalinga Seneviratne Since President Donald Trump made the shock announcement last week of freezing United States’ (US) foreign aid budget for three months while threatening to close down its main delivery agency, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the multi-million dollar aid industry has been in shock, while the western media, particularly the American media, has been saturated with reports of how the poor of the world will suffer, if the US aid budget is frozen. In reporting the aid freeze, New York Times (NYT) in an article under the heading 'Health programs shutter around the world' said that health workers across Africa, South America and Southeast Asia were in tears talking to NYT about how years of building health care assistance to the vulnerable over the years are now facing closedowns. The report cited national malaria control programs in Uganda; provision of dehydration salts to treat life-threatening diarrhoea in toddlers and drugs to stop brain haemorrhages in pregnant women in Zambia; clinical trials of the use of medical devices by patients in Africa and South America: and frontline care for treatment of chronicle disease such as HIV-AIDS, as among the programs that will be threatened by this aid freeze. 'They presented a compassionate, generous image of the United States in countries where China has increasingly competed for influence,' noted NYT. Washington Post noted that the US 'is by far' the world’s largest source of foreign assistance providing '4 out of every 10 dollars donated for humanitarian aid'. While pointing out that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio has provided a waiver on some forms of humanitarian aid, it said, the 'move would rescue more of the programs that keep alive refugees, the gravely ill and others around the World'. London’s Guardian focusing on USAID programs in Southeast Asia said, 'such funding provides humanitarian assistance to communities that are among the most vulnerable in the world to natural disasters, as well as support for pro-democracy activists who risk their lives to campaign against repressive regimes'. It pointed out as examples, funding for health care centers on the Thai border for tens of thousands of Myanmar refuges; even within Myanmar there are junta-controlled health ministry’s HIV programs that US funds. Development newswire Devex focused on how Trump’s aid freeze is impacting on the USAID funded Bureau for Humanitarian Affairs that predicts famines in Africa and help to move food aid to the needy. It also focused in another article on how the freeze would threaten the continuation of USAID funded climate change mitigation projects in the Global South. These type of reports have been reproduced widely in the Asian media. But, what these reports conveniently ignore is another side of USAID activities that make up a substantial portion of USAID funding – that is assistance some times in tow with other American and western aid agencies such as the National Endowment for Democracy and the Soros Foundation agencies, that fund 'regime change' campaigns around the world, known as 'colour revolutions'. At the 2022 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in Uzbekistan, Chinese President Xi Jingping warned member countries of such activities funded by 'external forces' and offered to set up a training center in China to train counter terrorism personnel to counter it. In a scathing commentary in Sri Lanka Guardian (SLG)[1] on 3rd February, it argued that Trump is unmasking 'a monster in disguise' in USAID. 'This agency which claims to be a beacon of democracy and human rights, operates under a far more insidious agenda of geopolitical interference, manipulation, and exploitation of foreign political systems,' SLG argued. It further said that the agency’s so-called 'funding for democracy' is a ruse, that is a carefully constructed narrative designed to conceal its real aims to destabilize governments and control the political landscape in nations to served US geopolitical interests. SLG gives a long list of examples to back this claim that includes the agency’s involvement in the ZunZuneo project in Cuba using stolen phone numbers to track and profile Cuban citizens to manipulate their political thinking. It says this is not an isolated incident; a similar project has been funded in Venezuela targeting the Nicolas Madura government. Ukraine is another country where USAID has been pouring millions of dollars over the years to build an anti-Russia movement. In Egypt they have been involved in the ‘Arab Spring’ movement that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. Sri Lanka is no stranger to USAID’s interference in local politics, where, with the close involvements of the US Ambassador in Colombo, local NGOs have been funded under the disguise of good governance and democracy projects to interfere in elections such as in 2015 and 2024. In June 2023, the US Ambassador in Bangkok was forced to call a press conference to deny allegations in Thailand the USAID and other funding agencies were involved in manipulating the young people to vote for a new party that had obvious US-leanings, and was also accused of trying to undermine the Thai monarchy[2]. After the long-time Bangladesh leader Sheikh Hasina was overthrown by a student-led protest movement, in August 2024, Indian media reports claimed that USAID has been instrumental in funding the protect movement. The protests started at the BRACS University. BRACS (Building Resource Across Communities) is Bangladesh’s largest international development agency (with operations overseas) that has been heavily funded by USAID and Gates Foundation for years. Following Hasina’s overthrow, founder of Grameen Bank Mohamad Yunus, who is extremely close to the Democratic Party in the US, was installed as Interim leader. SLG notes that USAID’s operation remains largely immune to public scrutiny in the US, 'leaving it free to continue its agenda of political manipulation, covert intervention and exploitation (of local youth)'. SLG calls on the US government to 're-evaluate USAID’s mission and its operation must to held to highest ethical standards'. Perhaps there is a silver lining. It is interesting to note that Washington Post[3] reported on 3rd February, that Trump’s trouble shooter Elon Musk has described USAID as a 'criminal organization' and it 'deserves to die' after his DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) team members were denied access to USAID offices by staff. One hopes that Musk and his DOGE team would be able to clean up the unethical practices of the US government’s official aid program, and the Trump administration’s isolationist policy would stop further creation of chaos in the Global South through manipulation of restless youth.

What About The Price Of Beef? – OpEd	By Mark Thornton In September 2023, we looked at the high price of beef and how big government has been bad for the American family budget. With stock indexes even higher, the situationfor beef consumers is even worse. In the US, the price of hamburger meat ended last year near a record high of $5.60 per pound. Just 5 years earlier—prior to covid—it was $3.88 per pound. From the early 1980s to 2000, hamburger meat averaged $1.50 per pound. That means that over that 40+-year period, hamburger meat is four times as expensive. While that seems like a big increase—and it is—the rate of increase is only slightly higher than what the government claims has been the increase in consumer prices in general over the entire period as measured by their Consumer Price Index or CPI. So, beef has been a fairly accurate barometer of the impact of government and Federal Reserve policies undermining the household economy. The most rapid increase in beef prices and consumer prices in general have come in the aftermath of the Trump-Biden covid spending sprees and, of course, the vast money printing by the Federal Reserve unleashed in 2020. Like most businesses, raising cattle and related businesses have faced significant increases in costs due mostly to inflationary forces. Grains used to feed cattle are impacted by monetary inflation. There was a huge upward spike in grain prices from the Fed’s covid monetary inflation. Often blamed on Russia’s invasion of grain-producing Ukraine, grain prices actually peaked around the time of the invasion, leveled off, and even subsequently declined as the world economy contracted. Even though grain prices have retreated, herd size must have come under enormous pressure with the covid inflation as grain price surged, herd size retreated. Beef consumption also retreated in the post-GFC inflationary contraction. With prices relatively high, and grain prices and herd sizes having retreated, beef producers are in a temporary sweet spot, but consumers and others along the supply chain, such as processors and wholesalers remain soured. It is a tough competitive business, subject to the cycles of uncertainty. Another largely-unnoticed inflationary impact on beef supply and prices is the Fed monetary policy. The Fed has been suppressing interest rates for decades and causing price inflation. They did it again during covid on a massive level and have only recently tried to 'normalize' interest rates. Every real estate agent, broker, dealer, and investor knows that interest rates are the major key to the real estate market. One aspect that I explored in my book, the Skyscraper Curse (free HTML, PDF, or ePub download here) is that artificially low interest rates increase the demand to buy land and this causes land prices to increase. Higher land prices mean that some land used for cattle might have been purchased and developed into different uses or land that could be used to expand cattle ranching might simply have been too expensive to purchase and convert into cattle production. It is possible to produce cattle and beef with very little land, as the Japanese famously do. However, economically speaking, it is much cheaper to produce cattle on grass and pastureland if that land is superabundant and close to market. You need far less land if feed corn and other grains were superabundant. However, the current circumstances are that land is scarce and high-priced and feed grains are also expensive and might get even more expensive. Both of those market conditions are driven, in large part, by the Fed’s monetary inflation. I also suspect government intervention on behalf of the environmental terrorists might be playing a role. These are 'angry' people who think that cow farts are a catastrophic problem, and that we all should be forced to follow their personal dietary philosophies, such as vegetarianism or veganism. This has certainly crippled the industry in Europe, which has experienced drastically restricted consumption and high prices. This should be opposed. The beef industry—including all the processing and final product sectors—also faces a consumer base that is experiencing declining inflation-adjusted incomes. The net result is that fewer Americans even bother stopping at the meat counter, pick cheaper cuts of beef, and opt for pork, chicken, and other cheaper protein substitutes. The US beef industry is in the midst of one of its largest two-year declines in beef production. This will have significant ramifications for everyone from consumers to cattle producers. Consumers will face higher retail prices than they did in 2023. Per capita beef consumption in the US has been on a relative decline since we were taken off the Bretton Woods Gold Standard, but in the last couple of years there have been significant declines. With reduced herd sizes and prices sky high, that decline seems unlikely to be reversed in 2025. We may get some relief in the intermediate term, but I fear the long-term nutritional decline that current trends dictate. Based on my own anecdotal evidence, the high price of beef steaks and roasts makes people grumpy. It also undermines health because beef meals are highly nutritional and provide very high-quality protein. I personally don’t accept the government’s public relations campaign against beef and butter. One thing is for sure, Americans followed the guidelines, but the expected results did not materialize, quite the contrary. Diabetes and obesity are at all-time record highs. Heart attack deaths have declined, but surely most of that is due to better detection and care, the hundreds of thousands of bypass and stent operations every year, and better emergency medical services. Is there a magic wand to solve the problem of high beef prices, as well as high pork and chicken prices? Actually yes, begin by returning to the gold standard or at least don’t allow the Fed to target interest rates or increase the money supply. Remove the wild swings in the market and make investment more certain. The second day, release vast amounts of federally-controlled land and eliminate the ethanol program that diverts corn into our gasoline. Peace in Ukraine and the Middle East would unleash more food and fuel for the human population and this translates to improvements for the people directly impacted and to the general world population. Also, pursue efforts to roll back environmental restrictions and open up oil and gas production, which will reduce farming and fertilizer prices, as well as increase production and jobs generally. All of this combined would drive up people’s real incomes, greatly reduce the cost of beef, and stimulate beef production. Within one production cycle, the American family would be back to their once-a-week steak nights.

In Central African Republic, A Campaign Of Terror By Wagner’s Suc...	By Jean-Fernand Koena, Maja Zivanovic and Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- Just after noon on January 17, 2023, Privat Damabakizi, 35, and his wife were working in their farm field in a tiny Central African Republic settlement near the border with Cameroon when his brother, Alvin, called him. Seven armed men wearing camouflage uniforms had just driven up in pickup trucks at Damabakizi’s home in Bouar, a town about 7 kilometers away from the field. The men were white-skinned, wearing balaclavas, Alvin recalled in an interview with RFE/RL. They spoke poor French, the main language in the country. They were Russians, who were a common presence in the area. They were looking for Damabakizi. 'I was worried. I called him and asked him what he had done for the Russians to come here.' Alvin recalled in an interview with RFE/RL. 'These people are bad people.' Damabakizi told Alvin not to worry and said he’d come to the house immediately. Alvin told him to go to the police instead. When Damabakizi drove up a short time later, the Russians grabbed him and threw him into one of their trucks, beating him with their rifle butts and stabbing him with bayonets. Later, his wife, Nelly, cried as they drove away with Damabakizi. The next day, after frantically calling local authorities, Alvin said, prosecutors told him that Damabakizi had been accused of buying items -- probably radios -- that had been stolen from a nearby military base used by the Russian mercenaries. Alvin and Nelly never saw Damabakizi again. They believe he was tortured before he died. They don’t know where his body is. Rich in natural resources, wracked by ethnic conflict, gripped by extreme poverty and rampant corruption, the Central African Republic (CAR) has long been a case study of a failed state. It has also become a laboratory for a dangerous political experiment: state capture by a private company. In this case, a company that pairs war-fighting and security with lucrative commercial interests, mainly extracting gold, diamonds, and timber. The company is, or was, the Wagner Group. The creation of a profane, politically connected St. Petersburg chef more than a decade ago, Wagner evolved into one of Russia’s most potent fighting forces, at the vanguard of military operations on the ground in Syria, Libya, and most prominently, Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin also built parallel business networks that eventually spread into enterprises as diverse as school-lunch catering in Russia and hardwood timber export-import in Africa. Wagner officially no longer exists, after Prigozhin was killed in an August 2023 plane crash that most experts believe was a targeted assassination, likely orchestrated at the highest levels of the Kremlin. The company’s armed units were mostly split up, incorporated into the Defense Ministry and other Russian agencies. But Prigozhin’s lucrative businesses largely remain -- especially in the Central African Republic, where they generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues from diamond and gold mining, timber harvesting, weapons trafficking, and other sources. Insecure Security Since 2018, Wagner fighters have acted as a personal security service for the country’s president, Faustin-Archange Touadera, while also serving to prop up his government. After winning the presidency in 2015, Touadera was reelected in December 2020, though the vote was threatened by a violent challenge from Touadera’s rival, Francois Bozize, who had been barred from running for reasons some observers said were dubious. Rebranded inside CAR, Wagner’s successor units, meanwhile, have become a paramilitary police force, operating outside the law, committing human rights and other crimes with impunity. In CAR, 'Wagner has perfected a blueprint for state capture, supporting a criminalized state hijacked by the Central African president and his inner circle, amassing military power, securing access to and plundering precious minerals, and subduing the population with terror,' according to a 2023 report by The Sentry, a U.S.-based nongovernmental research organization that was co-founded by the actor George Clooney. People who have been victimized by Russian mercenaries say they can attest to the fear that Russian units have instilled in parts of the population. 'Imagine what [little] power you have when people come with weapons and they don’t speak your language,' another man, who asked to be identified only by the name Adam, said in an interview in September. 'Am I supposed to just wait until they come back again? Who knows what’s going to happen if they do come back?' Adam, a shopkeeper in a village two hours southwest of the capital, Bangui, said that his store had been ransacked and robbed by 'white guys with tattoos and face masks' who spoke Russian. 'Outside of the capital…a lot of people are suffering there and no one seems to know' about it, he told RFE/RL. 'It’s my case but it's also the case of many more people in different places and regions.' ‘Unbridled Brutality’ When Wagner mercenaries first deployed to CAR in 2018, they arrived ostensibly for a training and instruction mission, and to provide security services to Touadera’s government. Wagner incorporated a company called Sewa Security Services to serve as the local entity overseeing Russian fighters in the country. A larger force of ex-Wagner fighters was incorporated by the Russian Defense Ministry under the name 'Africa Corps.' Up to 2,300 fighters may have been deployed at the height of the Wagner presence, by some estimates. As recently as September, a former top Wagner assault commander was appointed Touadera’s top security adviser. Many people also credited Russian forces with tamping down a yearslong conflict fueled by religious and ethnic differences and the struggle for control over the country’s wealth. Over the years that followed, however, activists, reporters, and experts -- even the United Nations -- accumulated a mountain of evidence pointing to crimes -- murder, torture, execution, abductions, rape, theft -- credibly linked to Wagner forces and their successor entities. Between 2018 and 2024, Russian troops were involved in more than 100 gun battles, and committed more than 362 incidents of violence against civilians, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project, a U.S.-based nonprofit that tracks violent events around the world. The violence resulted in at least 786 fatalities. In 2021, a coalition of rebel groups launched an abortive coup targeting Touadera, following a contested presidential election. Wagner troops helped government forces repel the effort. In its wake, Russia’s ambassador to the country, Vladimir Titorenko, declared that 'the Russian soldiers will remain until the [opposition] rebels and the bandits of the armed groups are completely wiped out.' In a 2022 report, Human Rights Watch quoted more than three dozen people who had been victims of various crimes between February 2019 and November 2021. All said the abuses were committed by men with white skin speaking Russian, a language the witnesses recognized. A UN working group that researched the use of mercenaries in CAR and elsewhere reported witness statements describing Russian officers committing rape and sexual violence against women, men, and young girls. Many survivors are reluctant to file formal complaints with authorities because of fear of retribution, the group found. Reports of torture are rampant; one common method, the UN monitoring group found, involves connecting a person’s genitals to electric cables and then electrocuting them. 'The welcome contribution of Russian bilateral forces to improving the security situation contrasts with the denunciation of the human rights violations they commit,' a UN-appointed official, Yao Agbetse, said separately in an August 2022 report. Testimonies from witnesses point to 'unbridled brutality' on the part of Russian forces. 'By speaking to you, I also tell myself that they will react and I’m afraid because saying that I’m not afraid is not true,' Alvin said in an interview with RFE/RL last November. 'I don’t know what might happen to me tomorrow or the day after.' On the morning of August 9, 2024, Adam was manning his small food-and-goods shop in the village of Mbaiki when he noticed two pickup trucks, and a number of motorcycles, roaring into town. A group of heavily armed men started barking orders to local men and boys, demanding identification. Some appeared to be personnel from the Central African Armed Forces, known by the acronym FACA. They beat Adam and some of the other men with their guns, demanding to know if they had stored weapons, and, if so, where. They were followed, Adam said, by 'white guys with tattoos and face masks' who spoke Russian. The Russians broke into his store and filled their vehicles with stolen goods, he said: 'They took shoes, tents, cooking stoves, rice, cooking oil, even veterinary medicines. They emptied my store.' The convoy then headed to another village, where they continued looting stores, asking local men to show IDs. Adam said his cousin, who tried to escape, was shot and thrown into the truck with the group of other men. The Russians drove the truck about 2 kilometers away, Adam said, then they cut his cousin’s neck. 'They left him near the main road, like 10 minutes’ walk into the bush, then tied a rope around his belly and hung him in a nearby tree,' he said. Sometime later, Adam and others found his cousin's body in the tree, he said. They cut his body down, then buried him. 'Who Am I Supposed To Complain To?' Igor Ngaisse said that, in December 2020, his aunt Albertine was gunned down by Russian soldiers, possibly as a bystander to a shootout with rebel fighters. On January 25, 2021, he said, he was lying down in his small house in Sibut, a village north of Bangui, when he suddenly heard gunfire outside. He waited until the shooting subsided, then peeked out of his room to see a Russian soldier walking down the hallway. Igor said he bolted out of the building, then listened as the soldier proceeded to fire his rifle into each room, and then rake the main living room with gunfire. Ngaisse said his 25-year-old younger sister remained hidden inside the house, frightened but unharmed. After the incident, which was covered by local media, Ngaisse sought help from the local police commissioner, he said, and they confronted what appeared to be a senior Russian officer, who then offered him 5,000 Central African francs (about $8), which seemed to be simply spare change in his pocket. Insulted, Ngaisse refused it. 'If I have to complain, who am I supposed to complain to?' he told RFE/RL. 'I don’t know exactly what’s happening in this country.' 'The number of victims of Wagner human rights abuses continues to increase,' Jelena Aparac, who used to head the UN working group on mercenaries, told RFE/RL in a text message. '[Regrettably] there are no coordinated investigations and [no] effective accountability.' And Russian soldiers have gained notoriety for the brutal tactics they’ve employed to intimidate people -- even those they have trained themselves. Like with Jose Befio, who had previously been recruited by government forces and trained by Wagner soldiers to command a local unit of a nationwide militia known as the Anti-balaka. Befio, who UN monitors said had been implicated in past violent crimes of his own, later backed away from supporting the government and its Russian allies. He spoke out against some of the crimes that Russian soldiers committed in the region, his uncle, Bachir Itoumandji, and two of his wives told RFE/RL. On July 23, 2024, Befio was sleeping in his home before dawn in the central town of Bouca when Russian soldiers burst in to kidnap him, and a close aide. Itoumandji said he and other relatives woke early to the sound of gunfire and explosions. When it ended at dawn, he drove to a local cotton gin facility, where the shooting had taken place. When he found the bodies of Befio and his aide, Itoumandji said, the Russians had beheaded the two and swapped their heads, putting Befio’s head in the aide’s arms, and vice versa. Photographs of the bodies circulated widely in the country, and the UN monitoring mission also recorded the incident. The bystanders who were already there told Itoumandji that Russian soldiers were responsible. 'We brought him inside and put his head back in its place, and his comrade’s,' he said. 'We washed the bodies before burying them.' They also kidnapped three of Befio’s young children and held them for days, Itoumandji said. When they were returned to the family, all three children had had their teeth pulled out. Befio’s beheading was part of a pattern of atrocities and public executions committed by both Russian soldiers and FACA, said Charles Bouessel, a country expert with the International Crisis Group, a Belgian-based think tank. 'Terror is used as a weapon because Wagner and FACA may not have enough forces to be present everywhere on the ground,' Bouessel told RFE/RL. 'They use fear, which can be an efficient way to get people to tell information, and sell information' to the Russians. Befio’s beheading, and the photographs that circulated, also probably served as a public warning, he said. 'It could be a message to other warlords, a way to pacify the country,' Bouessel said. 'It’s possible this was a message: If you violate your promises to Wagner, this is what is waiting for you.' Despite substantial evidence complied by rights activists, plus UN experts, Russian officials in Moscow and in Bangui have repeatedly denied accusations of Russians committing crimes in the country. 'Russian military advisers could not participate and did not participate in murders or robberies. This is another lie,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a 2021 United Nations report. RFE/RL sought comment from the CAR Foreign Ministry about the reports of Russian crimes, but received no response. A spokesman for Touadera’s office also refused to answer questions, saying only that 'cooperation with Russia is excellent and this [fact] disturbs the Westerners who want to demonize the Central African Republic.' Despite the fear and intimidation inflicted -- with government blessing, experts say -- there’s no indication that Russia’s security presence is going anywhere anytime soon. If anything, Touadera and his administration have moved to deepen ties. Last month, Touadera traveled to Moscow, where he received a red-carpet welcome and a small honor guard parade just outside the Kremlin walls. A month earlier, meanwhile, a new monument appeared in the CAR capital: a pair of statues dedicated to the late Prigozhin, and Dmitry Utkin, the ex-soldier credited with being Wagner’s first commander, who was also killed in the 2023 plane crash.

How Not To Get Seduced By Foreign Spies: China’s Spy Agency	By Qian Lang Since China’s secretive spy agency -- the Ministry of State Security -- got itself a WeChat account, it has been churning out cautionary tales about spies as warnings to an unsuspecting public. The account, set up in July 2023, was quiet at first, only publishing four warnings in all of last year. But it has stepped up activity in recent weeks, cranking out five warnings in January alone under the slogan 'National Security is Everyone’s Responsibility.' Recently, it warned people: - not to get seduced by 'tall, beautiful people' - not to gossip carelessly when they travel home for Lunar New Year - be aware that 'foreign spies' could be reading their online comments and lurking on social media 'Foreign espionage agencies may actively connect with key target groups by disguising themselves as rich and beautiful, or tall, rich and handsome individuals,' the agency warned in a Jan. 16 post to its official WeChat account. 'Once a relationship is established, they may use the emotional connection to trick their targets into providing confidential information,' it said in a post titled, 'Keep your eyes open, and build a Great Wall of Steel against espionage.' Spooking foreign investors The insistence that foreign spies are everywhere has spooked foreign investors in the wake of raids of foreign-owned firms and recent changes to national security legislation. Commentators say the warnings likely have more to do with political turf wars in Beijing and encouraging people to spy on each other than with any concerted public action against a possible threat from overseas. Officials, scientists and college teachers and students are likely targets for seduction, brainwashing, bribery and coercion, especially anyone with access to confidential information, it said. Foreign spies may 'disguise themselves as considerate, caring and open-minded confidants,' or 'lurk in chat rooms, online forums and other online platforms' to recruit people. Anyone going overseas on vacation has been warned that foreign intelligence agencies 'may take the opportunity to infiltrate, and personnel in confidential positions need to be vigilant, not trust strangers, and not disclose work secrets.' 'If there is a language barrier, they should seek interpreting assistance and never answer casually; if the questions involve state secrets, they should ... refuse to answer,' according to a Jan. 25 post to the feared Ministry’s WeChat account. Cautionary tale On Friday, the agency published the tale of a man surnamed Han who was lured into selling confidential documents by his desire for a life of 'extravagance and luxury.' 'Once the idea of ​​selling secrets came into his mind, it quickly dragged Han towards the abyss of crime like the claws of a demon,' the post said. Han stored secrets on private hard drives, then contacted foreign agencies anonymously in the hope of selling them. When the state security police caught up with Han, he was on his computer bargaining with foreign espionage agencies to sell more confidential information. He collapsed to the ground, saying 'I didn’t expect you to be that fast!' according to the post. The penalty for 'espionage' as defined by the authorities can range from five or 10 years to life imprisonment, or even death in cases deemed 'particularly serious,' the agency said, adding that Han would be 'severely punished.' ‘Not real counter-espionage’ The agency has also warned people against 'connecting to unfamiliar Wi-Fi networks' and ordered them to store confidential documents securely, as well as keeping online security defenses up to date 'The Ministry of State Security used to operate as part of the ‘secret front,’' former police station deputy director Guo Min told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. 'Now they’re kicking up a big propaganda fuss, but it’s not real counter-espionage or national security.' 'Counter-espionage work doesn’t usually require ordinary people to come forward.' Chinese authorities have typically employed a highly elastic definition of what constitutes a state secret, and national security charges are frequently leveled at journalists, rights lawyers and activists, often based on material they post online. Article 14 of China’s Law on Safeguarding State Secrets, which was amended last year, divides state secrets into three categories: top secret; confidential and secret. Which information falls into which category is left to the authorities to decide, according to Article 15. The lack of definition makes 'endangering state security' an easy crime to pin on anyone sharing information the government doesn’t like, according to critics. Guo said anyone working in sensitive areas with access to confidential information or state secrets will already have received extensive security training, as he did while a serving police officer. 'What they’re actually doing is mobilizing the general public to keep an eye on each other,' he said. Political jostling The move is also highly political, according to some analysts. A legal professional from the southern province of Guangdong who gave only the surname Mou for fear of reprisals said the spy agency is jostling with its key rival for government funding, the Ministry of Public Security, which presides over China’s police force. 'The Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Public Security have been competing over their remits,' Mou said. 'State security would normally have jurisdiction over cases with a foreign connection, and doesn’t wield as much [domestic] power as public security does,' he said. 'There may be a power struggle going on but there may also be other reasons that we don’t understand.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3buU3v2dZmQm4T	2025-02-08T16:39:05-08:00	
US Surveillance Plane Crashes In Southern Philippines	An aircraft contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense crashed in the southern Philippines, killing all four people on board including a member of the military, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said in a news release. The aircraft, identified by police as a Beechcraft King Air 300, crashed Thursday afternoon in Maguindanao del Sur province. The U.S. military command said in a statement that the plane was 'providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support at the request of our Philippine allies. 'The incident occurred during a routine mission in support of U.S.-Philippine security cooperation activities.' One U.S. military member and three defense contractors died in the crash, the statement said. The command withheld the names and did not list the nationalities of the three contractors pending notification of next of kin. The airplane crashed in a rice field in Barangay Malatimon, Maguindanao. Residents heard an explosion and saw smoke billowing from the plane before it came down, the Associated Press news agency said. The King Air 300 is a twin-engine turboprop often used by military and law enforcement authorities to conduct search and rescue, reconnaissance and surveillance, as well as other special operations. It is designed and manufactured by Beechcraft Augsburg, a subsidiary of U.S. aircraft company Textron Aviation. U.S. military personnel with an intelligence unit have been deployed in the southern Philippines to help local forces fighting against Muslim militants. In 2017, with intelligence support provided by U.S. military aircraft, the Philippine government successfully ended a five-month siege by Islamic State militants in the southern city of Marawi.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3budBdUR0M3bl9	2025-02-08T16:34:55-08:00	
Trump, Ishiba Declare ‘New Golden Age’ For US-Japan Ties	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met at the White House on Friday, declaring a 'new golden age' for U.S.-Japan ties. Many in Japan had been anxious about whether Ishiba would be able to build rapport with the unpredictable Trump during their high-stakes first meeting, especially amid the U.S. president’s early foreign policy moves that have rattled allies and adversaries alike. But the leaders spoke highly of each other, with Trump kicking off their joint news conference by presenting Ishiba with a photo of them in the Oval Office earlier. 'I wish I was as handsome as him, but I’m not,' Trump joked. He continued by underscoring that the United States is 'totally committed' to Japan’s security and vowing to strengthen economic ties. At the Oval Office ahead of their meeting, Ishiba lavished praise on Trump, saying he was inspired by Trump’s undaunted spirit, even after an assassination attempt, to win the election and fulfil his mission to 'Make America Great Again.' 'And also, you will redouble your efforts to bring peace to the world,' Ishiba said. 'And that is why God saved you in that experience.' Ishiba’s visit comes amid Tokyo’s concern at what Trump has said to some U.S. allies and partners: He has said he wants to absorb Canada as a U.S. state, acquire Greenland from Denmark and take control of the Panama Canal. 'We would like to first establish a higher relationship of trust and cooperation between two countries, especially the two leaders,' a senior Japanese government official told reporters during a briefing Thursday. The U.S. president has imposed new 10% tariffs on China and 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico — although the latter two have been delayed, at least temporarily. He has warned of possible tariffs against other countries, especially those with whom the U.S. holds a trade deficit, such as Japan. On Friday, Trump said he would enact reciprocal tariffs on trading partners. 'A country pays so much, it charges us so much, and we do the same, so very reciprocal,' he said. Ishiba declined to say whether he will retaliate. Other strains on the U.S.-Japan relationship include former President Joe Biden’s blocking of a $15 billion acquisition bid by Japan’s largest steel producer, Nippon Steel, for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. Biden blocked the deal during the final weeks of his term, citing national security concerns. Trump has said he also opposes the deal but now appears open to negotiation. 'They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,' Trump said. 'We didn't like the idea. U.S. Steel is a very important company to us.' Japan agreed to increase investments in key U.S. sectors, as well as purchasing more American liquefied natural gas — important agenda items for Trump. Continuity on security front In a joint statement, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific through 'multilayered cooperation with like-minded nations.' Under then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Japan became a key player in what the Biden administration called a 'lattice-like strategic architecture' to bolster deterrence against the two main U.S. adversaries in the Pacific: China and North Korea. Biden’s approach connected Tokyo with other allies in trilateral formats and other groupings, including with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, to deter regional threats in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula. The Trump administration will continue to support trilateral efforts and some of the working groups that have come out from under those over the last few years, a Trump official said in a briefing to reporters Friday morning. 'There may be some adjustments to where the focus is on trilateral cooperation, but I think largely you will see continuity,' the official said. During his first term, Trump and then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed on the 'free and open Indo-Pacific' framework to promote peace and prosperity in the region. The two countries also agreed to elevate what’s known as the Quad grouping with India and Australia. The fact that the Trump administration sees those formats as a critical part of its strategy in the Pacific is important, said Jeffrey Hornung, the Japan Lead for the RAND National Security Research Division. The joint leaders’ statement 'follows the trend of keeping the alliance on an even keel regardless of the administration,' Hornung told VOA. He pointed out that the statement includes language used by past administrations such as 'strong opposition' to any attempts by China to change the status quo by force in the East China Sea, against 'provocative activities' in the South China Sea and emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The two leaders also expressed support for 'Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international organizations.' Hornung noted it as a new development that is 'significant because it demonstrates an effort to try to give Taiwan more diplomatic support in the limited areas they can.' In dealing with the threats from Pyongyang, the leaders reaffirmed commitment to 'complete denuclearization of North Korea.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3buavOC380oLRX	2025-02-08T16:30:51-08:00	
Lebanon: President Aoun, PM Salam Form Government	By Najia Houssari Twenty-six days after Nawaf Salam was assigned to form a Lebanese government, the decrees for its formation were announced on Saturday from the Presidential Palace. President Joseph Aoun accepted the resignation of Najib Mikati’s government. The Council of Ministers is scheduled to hold its first session at the Presidential Palace next Tuesday. In a speech after announcing the formation of the government, Salam said he hoped that 'it would be a government of reform and salvation, because reform is the only way for Lebanon to rise.' He added: 'With President Aoun, we launch the workshop to build a new Lebanon.' He said that 'the diversity of ministers’ names will not hinder the function of government, and no government formation will satisfy everyone. We will work in a unified manner. I am keeping in mind the establishment of a state of law and institutions, and we are laying the foundations for reform and rescue. There is no room to turn back time, and we must begin work immediately. 'The government will have to work with parliament to complete the implementation of the Taif Agreement and proceed with financial and economic reforms. 'The government will be a place for constructive joint work and not for disputes. I am determined to lay the foundations for reform and rescue in cooperation with President Aoun.' Salam continued: 'This government will strive to restore trust and bridge the gap between the state and the aspirations of the youth. It must work toward the full implementation of the Taif Agreement, proceed with financial and economic reforms, and establish an independent judiciary.' He emphasized the importance of 'ensuring security and stability in Lebanon by completing the implementation of Resolution 1701.' He said: 'It is difficult for any government formation to satisfy everyone. However, the government will endeavor to be cohesive, and diversity will not serve as a source of obstruction to its work, nor will it provide a platform for narrow interests.' The government included Tarek Mitri as deputy prime minister, Michel Menassa as defense minister, Ahmad Hajjar as interior minister, Youssef Raji as foreign minister, Yassine Jaber as finance minister, Ghassan Salameh as culture minister, Laura Khazen Lahoud as tourism minister, Kamal Chehade as minister of displaced persons and artificial intelligence, Nora Bayrakdarian as minister of sports and youth, Rima Karami as education minister, Adel Nassar as justice minister, Rakan Nasser Eldine as health minister, Mohammed Haidar as labor minister, Joseph Sadi as energy minister, Amir Bisat as economy minister, Charles Hajj as telecommunications minister, Joe Issa El-Khoury as industry minister, Fayez Rasamny as public works minister, Nizar El-Hani as agriculture minister, Fadi Makki as minister of administrative development, Tamara Zein as environment minister, Hanin Sayyed as social affairs minister and Paul Marcos as information minister. Salam’s government during Aoun’s presidency has broken the norms established by Hezbollah and its allies over three terms, which dictated that the government be composed of direct party representatives and that Hezbollah maintain a significant influence capable of obstructing decisions at every critical political or security juncture. A technocratic government has been formed, one that is widely acknowledged and uncontested by political parties. Despite pressure from Hezbollah and the Amal Movement over the past few weeks to form a government similar to its predecessor, both the president and the prime minister-designate stood firm. As a result, they eventually formed a government that reflects the reformist spirit expressed in Aoun’s oath speech. The new government has no members affiliated with the Free Patriotic Movement, but it does have representatives close to the Lebanese Forces Party. Notably, it includes five women, and for the first time, a ministerial portfolio has been dedicated to artificial intelligence. The government consists of 24 ministers. Its formation was delayed from Friday to Saturday due to disagreements over Shiite representation. At noon on Saturday, Salam presented three candidates to the Presidential Palace for selection to fill the fifth Shiite seat in the administrative development portfolio. Fadi Makki, former adviser to Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2002, was chosen. Makki is known for pioneering the application of behavioral economics in public policy across the Middle East. The announcement of the new government coincided with the conclusion of the two-day visit by US deputy envoy for the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, who held discussions with several Lebanese officials. Ortagus’s statement at the Presidential Palace on Friday caught many by surprise, when she said: 'The US expresses its gratitude to our ally Israel for defeating Hezbollah. Hezbollah must not be part of the government in any way. It must remain demilitarized and militarily defeated.' According to Salam’s office, Ortagus met him and reaffirmed 'the US support for Lebanon in this new era and government.' Salam emphasized to Ortagus the need for 'international pressure to ensure Israel’s complete withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territories by the Feb. 18 deadline. This withdrawal must occur without delay or procrastination, in full compliance with international resolutions.' Ortagus also met the parliament speaker, Nabih Berri. Notably, during this meeting, she was not wearing the Star of David ring she had worn during her earlier meeting with the president on Friday. While Ortagus did not make a statement, Berri’s media office reiterated that 'Israel’s continued occupation of Lebanese territories necessitates our resistance.' In a separate development, Israeli forces continued to demolish homes in villages along the southern border. Meanwhile, for a third consecutive day, deadly clashes intensified in north-east Lebanon along the Syrian border and in villages straddling Lebanese and Syrian territories. On Friday, Aoun held a phone conversation with Syrian President Ahmad Al-Sharaa. They both agreed to coordinate efforts to control the situation on the Lebanese-Syrian border and prevent civilian casualties. The border town of Jarmash was targeted by missiles and drones, while additional missiles landed near the Lebanese town of Qasr, leaving one civilian seriously injured. After the shelling of the border area, the Lebanese Red Cross transported eight wounded people to hospitals in Hermel. The Lebanese town of Qanafez, on the northern border of Hermel, was hit by artillery shelling from the Qusayr countryside, breaking a night of relative calm. Armed clansmen intercepted and shot down three Shaheen drones over the northern border villages of Hermel, after they were launched from Syrian territory. According to the Lebanese National News Agency, they also destroyed a tank in the town of Jarmash. Lebanese media reports indicated that 10 members of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham were killed, while three others were captured in the aftermath of the clashes. The clashes broke out last Thursday when forces aligned with the new Syrian administration advanced on the border town of Hawik as part of a sweeping operation to 'seal off smuggling routes for weapons and contraband.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3buSQ4NxYgUdP4	2025-02-08T16:25:04-08:00	
EU-ASEAN Relations: Strengthening Trade, Security, And Sustainabi...	This paper aims to explore the current and future relationship between the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) a pivotal axis in global affairs concerning trade security and sustainable development. Both regional blocs have intensified their strategic engagement as they recognize their mutual interests in economic growth, political stability, and global governance. Although significant progress has been made geopolitical tension, regulatory barriers, and economic disparities will continue to challenge the strength and effectiveness of this partnership. The future EU -ASEAN relations hinges on how both navigate sides these complexities and develop a more comprehensive and robust partnership. Trade remains the most critical aspect of the EU-ASEAN relationship, as the two regions are economically interconnected. In the first two years of their partnership, ASEAN emerged as the EU's third-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding €250 billion. Currently, ASEAN is the largest trading partner of EU in the Southeast Asia highlighting the region bloc's increasing importance in the global economy. For instance, the Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement between ASEAN and the EU signed in 2022 enhances streamlines connectivity air services and promotes economic development between Europe and Southeast Asia. Additionally, the EU-ASEAN Blue Book 2024-2025 outlines new cooperation initiatives under the EU’s Global Gateway strategy which focuses infrastructure on digital and connectivity transport and investment facilitation. Nevertheless, the negotiation of a comprehensive ASEAN-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has faced hurdles due to regulatory issues and protectionism. The environmental and labor standards set by the EU pose challenges to ASEAN member economies which vary significantly in their regulatory frameworks. Today the EU has established bilateral FTAs with member ASEAN countries such as Singapore and Vietnam but a more comprehensive region-to-agreements region will require flexibility and compromise from both sides. However, the EU's strategy regarding environmental regulations such as the Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) raises concerns among ASEAN member countries regarding the potential impact on their competitiveness export. Between cooperation the EU-ASEAN and the field of security has also intensified in recent years. The Indo-Pacific region has become a strategic focal point for global powers, with the EU emerging as a significant player in the region's security dynamics. In 2024 the EU enhanced its maritime security cybersecurity and crisis management support to concentrate Vietnam on stability regional. These efforts align with the EU Indo-Pacific strategy which seeks to uphold international law, promote freedom of navigation, and counterbalance the rising of power in the South China Sea. However, ASEAN's security context is complex and influenced by the ongoing US-China rivalry. In its engagement, the EU and the ASEAN must navigate a delicate balance between the two powers. The disputes in the South China Sea further complicate the situation, as the shifting territorial claims of member states create internal divisions. This requires external actors, including the EU, to approach the matter with caution. While the EU advocates for a rules-based international order its capacity to influence direct security realities in the Indo-Pacific is limited to geographical distance and reliance on diplomacy rather than military engagement. Sustainability is another crucial focus of the EU-ASEAN partnership with increasing collaboration on climate change. The EU's deforestation regulation set to enter force in December 2025 will require products such as palm oil, coffee, and cocoa to be linked to verifiably deforestation-free supply chains. This policy demonstrates the EU's commitment to environmental stewardship but has drawn backlash from major palm oil countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. These countries argue that regulation could disrupt global supply and chains and adversely impact smallholder farmers who may struggle to meet stringent traceability requirements. The EU-ASEAN Green Partnership launched in 2021 aims to tackle these issues by promoting sustainable investment and technology transfer. Nonetheless, significant differences in economic agendas challenge this partnership. The EU's ambition emphasizes climate targets while ASEAN's development model relies heavily on industrialization and the exploitation of natural resources often growth prioritizing and development over environmental concerns. Both sides must therefore explore solutions, such as sharing climate and financial technologies, as ASEAN moves towards sustainability without compromising economic development. Despite these advances, several potential problems may jeopardize the long-term effectiveness of the EU-ASEAN partnership. Geopolitical tensions remain a primary concern especially as ASEAN itself is caught in the middle of the US-China rivalry. Internal divisions within both blocs hinder the EU's approach to ASEAN. ASEAN Operates on a consensus basis but diverging interests nationally complicate collective decision-making. Similarly EU state members have differing interests strategically affecting the bloc's ability to unite a front in its engagement with ASEAN. Trade and regulatory barriers also pose significant challenges. The product standards set by the EU often conflict with the more relaxed regulatory frameworks of ASEAN. For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has become contentious due to its data privacy provisions which some ASEAN countries view as restrictive. Finding a 'middle ground' between the compatibility and competitiveness of regulatory frameworks is essential for enhancing trade relations. Additionally economic disparities within ASEAN add complexity further to the partnership. While countries like Singapore and Malaysia boast strong economies, others such as Myanmar and Laos remain in stages of development. These disparities result in varying benefits from EU-ASEAN cooperation potentially exacerbating regional inequalities. Addressing this issue will require targeted capacity-building, initiatives financial support, and technology transfer to ensure ASEAN member states can engage with and benefit from the partnership with the EU. In conclusion, the partnership between the EU and ASEAN in 2025 can be characterized by the progress of significant trade in security and sustainability. However, to fully realize the potential of this alliance strategic regions must tackle cha persistent challenges through deepened policy engagement and economic diplomacy. As the global landscape continues to evolve effectiveness of EU-ASEAN relations will depend on their ability to manage risks harmonize regulatory frameworks and achieve inclusive economic growth. Together the EU and ASEAN can strengthen their mutual trust and commitment forge to a resilient and forward-looking partnership that contributes to global stability and shared prosperity.

South Korea In Crisis: How Political Turmoil Threatens Its Global...	In December 2024 South Korea was faced with a major political crisis after the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol. His impeachment charges of abuse power of and violation of the constitutional provisions on the separation of powers threw the country into political turmoil and impacted the country's domestic and foreign affairs. As one of the United States' key Asian allies, South Korea's political instability raises questions about the future of the South Korea-U.S. alliance, regional security, and policy effectiveness. Since North Korea’s nuclear threat and the rise of China are major issues in East Asia any turbulence in Seoul is not without consequences. This essay discusses the impact of political turmoil on the diplomatic relations of South Korea, the difficulties in the South Korea – United States relationship, and the general impact on the region. President Yoon’s impeachment has left South Korea with a lapse of leadership that impacts the country’s capacity to deal with the US properly. With a government temporarily in power while the Constitutional Court considers Yoon’s future there is no strong leadership to bolster Seoul’s diplomatic position. Previous studies indicate that stability in governance is a necessary condition for effective foreign policy. Nonetheless given the circumstances in South Korea Washington may not be willing to commit long long-term strategic partnerships because of the possibility of changes political in Seoul. The relations between South Korea and the United States is also affected by the fact that Yoon has been impeached. Investment sentiment turned negative and the markets tapered off as a result of political uncertainties. The Bank of Korea at its meeting in January 2025 discussed possible rate cuts given the heightened economic risks following political uncertainties. This financial instability may influence South Korea’s position in trade negotiations and economic relations with the U.S. Furthermore, the level of political uncertainty in South Korea raises questions about the country’s capability to honor its military treaties and support security partnerships. Nevertheless, Seoul which is split between the two major political parties may not be in a position to make clear-cut foreign policy decisions a situation that may hinder the United States from increasing its security commitments. As the Indo-Pacific region remains a priority for American policy, Washington sees South Korea as a key partner in countering the North Korean threat and preserving regional stability. One of the biggest issues in the preservation of the Korea South – United States alliance is the loss of trust. President Yoon’s administration has recently strengthened military relations with the United States, notably through the 2023 Washington Declaration, which reaffirmed their joint commitment to deterring North Korea. But his impeachment has everyone left guessing as to who will continue with these policies or if there will be a review of the relations with Washington. Another issue is the political friction within South Korea. The far-right nationalist groups have come out to support Yoon while the opposition has called for a of change tact in foreign policy especially regarding China and North Korea. The drama it makes difficult to work out what is happening diplomatically as the different parts of South Korea want completely different foreign policy strategies. This instability may deter Washington from investing in long-term strategic partnerships because of the possibility of sudden policy changes. Furthermore, the impeachment crisis has paved the way for North Korea to take advantage of the political weakness of South Korea. This early 2025 intelligence report indicated that there was an increase in the number of North Korean missile launches and had Seoul think that Pyongyang would take advantage of the political confusion to increase the provocation. The U.S. has expressed worries over the South Korean government, saying that it is not capable of tackling the security risks due to political instability. If Seoul is preoccupied with internal political disputes, its deterrence against North Korea may be diminished, prompting the United States to reconsider its defense commitments in the region. The effects of political risk in South Korea are not only limited to its relationship with the United States. The lack of clarity on government measures has led to FDI downbeat by multinational corporations which are not willing to commit to long-term projects. The Korea Trade Investment and Promotion Agency (KOTRA) data shows foreign investment inflows decreased by 7% in the last quarter of 2024 due to political risks in South Korea. In the security sector, the relationship between South Korea, Japan, and the United States may also be influenced. The historic Camp David Summit in 2023 provided a platform for the enhancement of security cooperation among the three countries. However, with Seoul’s leadership uncertain, the progress achieved through these agreements may be jeopardized. Japan is wary of the political risks in South Korea and may choose to focus on its relationship with the United States, potentially at the expense of ties with Seoul. Furthermore, following the domestic issues may limit South Korea’s response to regional conflicts that are not connected to the Korean Peninsula. The South China Sea is another disputed region with China claiming sovereignty over the waters. South Korea has always adopted a position of freedom supporting navigation operations led by the US Navy. However, with a politically frail administration, Seoul may adopt a more cautious position on the issue which may affect its relations with the United States and encourage Chinese expansionism in the region. In conclusion, President Yoon Yeol Suk's impeachment has created political instability in South Korea, affecting the stability of domestic policies as well as foreign and security relations. The lack of strong leadership undermines its diplomatic position with the United States, while uncertain economic conditions and diminished investor confidence complicate trade, military, and other agreements. This crisis also provides opportunities for North Korea and China to exploit South Korea’s weakened potentially state-shifting regional dynamics. To preserve alliances and strategic partnerships South Korea must restore political stability and demonstrate a consistent foreign policy to safeguard its national interests and regional security.

US Bishops Conference Lays Off 50 Amid Migrant Funding ‘Uncertain...	By Zelda Caldwell The U.S. Catholic bishops’ conference laid off 50 staff members in its migration and refugee services office Friday, citing a delay in reimbursements from the federal government. U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ spokesperson Chieko Noguchi, in a statement shared with CNA, said the job cuts were due to 'continuing uncertainty regarding refugee resettlement and the overall future of those programs.' 'Please pray for these dedicated men and women who have given so much of themselves in service to their sisters and brothers in need,' Noguchi said. The layoffs, first reported by The Pillar website Friday night, mark an escalation of a deepening political and financial crisis for the USCCB and its affiliated charitable agencies, whose decades-long role providing essential services for migrants and refugees largely paid with federal funds has come under scrutiny from President Donald Trump’s administration. The USCCB directs the bulk of the more than $100 million in federal grants it receives annually to affiliate organizations that provide migration and refugee services such as Catholic Charities. A large portion of funding comes from grants through the federal U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) to help resettle refugees who have been vetted by the federal government. According to the USCCB’s audited financial statements, federal funding covered more than 95% of what the conference spent on refugee and migrant programs in recent years. The USCCB has spent slightly more on these services than what is covered by federal funding, according to the financial statements. In 2023, the most recent year reported, the USCCB spent more than $134.2 million on these services with federal grants covering more than $129.6 million of the spending. In 2022, the USCCB spent nearly $127.4 million after getting nearly $123 million from the government. According to the USCCB Committee on Migration, the Catholic refugee resettlement network includes more than 65 affiliate offices throughout the United States. The bishops self-report that the USCCB and its Migration and Refugee Services help resettle about 18% of refugees who enter the country every year. The Pillar reported Friday night that a memo announcing the staff cuts was emailed to U.S. bishops by USCCB General Secretary Father Michael Fuller on Feb. 7. The memo followed White House directives to freeze federal grants and loans to nongovernmental organizations, and statements by Vice President JD Vance criticizing the USCCB for receiving federal money to help 'resettle illegal immigrants.' Fuller informed the bishops in the memo that 'to the best of my knowledge' no resettlement agencies or other nongovernmental agencies, including Catholic Relief Services, had received reimbursement from the federal government for their services since Trump took office on Jan. 20, The Pillar reported. On its website, Catholic Relief Services, which provides aid to the poor and other people in need in more than 100 countries, is urging its supporters to contact their representatives in Congress to let them know that they are 'deeply concerned about the administration’s recent decision to stop work on almost all U.S. foreign assistance programs.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3buUCse_68KKIy	2025-02-08T16:10:18-08:00	
Shared Challenges, AUKUS Partnership Top Topics As US, Australian...	By C. Todd Lopez Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met today with his counterpart Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles during a bilateral meeting at the Pentagon to discuss shared defense roles, security priorities, and the challenges and opportunities both nations see in the Indo-Pacific. It's the first such meeting Hegseth has had with one of his counterparts, though he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Feb. 5, 2025. A big part of their discussion involved progress on the Australia, U.K. and U.S. trilateral security agreement, known as AUKUS, which has been in place for just over three years. The first pillar of that agreement involves the delivery of a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability to Australia and also significant investments in the industrial bases of all three partner nations. As part of that plan, Australia will buy three Virginia-class submarines from the U.S. to be delivered in the 2030s. Together, all three partner nations will also develop a new platform called 'SSN-AUKUS,' which is expected to be ready for use by the U.K. in the 2030s and by Australia in the 2040s. The second AUKUS pillar involves enhancing joint capabilities and interoperability between the three nations. Hegseth said President Donald J. Trump is very familiar with the agreement and equally supportive of it. 'The president ... recognizes the importance of the defense industrial base,' Hegseth said. 'It enhances our ability in the [subsurface] space, but also our allies and partners ... this is not a mission in the Indo-Pacific that America can undertake by itself. It has to [include] robust allies and partners. Technology sharing and subs are a huge part of it.' A big part of AUKUS involves Australia investing heavily in the U.S. submarine industrial base. This week, in advance of Marles' visit with Hegseth, Australia made the first payment of $500 million toward a $3 billion promised investment. 'AUKUS is a very powerful symbol of our two countries working together in the Indo-Pacific,' Marles said. 'It represents a very significant increase of the American footprint on the Australian continent, something that we very much welcome. It represents an increase in Australian capability through the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine capability. But what comes with that is it also represents an increase in Australian defense.' He said Australia wants and is willing to pay for an increase in its defense. 'We really understand the importance of building our capability, but [also] in paying our way,' he said. 'That is a very important principle that we bring to bear, and one of the aspects of that is the contribution that we're making to your industrial base.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3bufzy_tylMsyZ	2025-02-08T16:04:44-08:00	
Iran Begins To Produce IrF6 At Nuclear Site	The production line of iridium hexafluoride (IrF6) –a compound used in the separation of Ir191 isotopes and enrichment processes- came into operation at the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) of Isfahan in central Iran on Saturday. The production line of IrF6 was unveiled by Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Mohammad Eslami at the UCF of Isfahan. Iridium hexafluoride is a compound of iridium and fluorine that is necessary for the isotopic separation of Ir191 and enrichment activities. IrF6 compound has various applications, such as in brachytherapy -a type of internal radiation therapy where radioactive sources are placed directly into or near the tumor-, low-dose medical radiography, production of radioactive sources utilized in the oil and gas industries, non-destructive testing (NDT), and radiobiology researches. Iran is now among the few countries with the technical know-how to produce IrF6 and can export the product.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3buZqd8920Ww5m	2025-02-08T15:59:58-08:00	
Trump’s Guantánamo Gambit: A Dark Turn In US Immigration Policy –...	The Trump administration’s decision to repurpose Guantánamo Bay for migrant detention is a move laden with symbolism, ethical dilemmas, and legal ambiguities. More than a mere logistical solution to an immigration surge, this policy is a stark statement about how the administration views migrants: not as individuals seeking refuge but as potential security threats. This OpEd explores the profound implications of this decision, dissecting its historical, legal, and moral dimensions to understand what it reveals about America’s priorities and values. Guantánamo Bay has long been synonymous with human rights abuses, indefinite detention, and legal limbo. Repurposing this notorious facility to house migrants signals a disturbing shift in America’s immigration stance. Instead of offering humanitarian assistance, the administration opts for punitive deterrence, aligning migration with criminality. This move sends a chilling message to the world: the U.S. is willing to blur the line between asylum seekers and suspected terrorists, reinforcing the narrative that migrants are security threats rather than individuals fleeing violence and persecution. Conflating Migration with Criminality: A Dangerous Precedent By placing migrants in a facility designed for terrorism suspects, the administration deepens the dangerous conflation between migration and national security threats. Even if migrants and detainees are kept separate, the decision reinforces a narrative that immigrants pose an inherent risk to American safety. This criminalization of migration echoes other controversial policies, such as family separations at the border. Over time, such policies erode the fundamental principle that seeking asylum is a legal right, not a crime. The long-term consequence is a normalization of policies that dehumanize migrants, making it easier to justify increasingly extreme measures. Guantánamo Bay is not designed for civilian detention. Reports of substandard conditions, psychological distress among detainees, and lack of transparency make it ill-suited for housing vulnerable migrant populations, many of whom are already fleeing trauma. The decision raises profound ethical questions: Is it justifiable to detain asylum seekers in a facility notorious for rights violations? What protections will be in place to ensure humane treatment? The rushed mobilization of troops and construction of makeshift tents further suggests that this policy is a reactive measure rather than a well-planned immigration strategy. The decision to use Guantánamo aligns seamlessly with Trump’s broader political strategy: leveraging fear to consolidate his base. Throughout his presidency, Trump has framed immigration as a crisis that necessitates extreme measures, from border walls to the travel ban. Detaining migrants in a military prison reinforces this image of immigration as an existential threat, energizing his supporters who favor hardline policies. More than a practical solution, this policy serves as a symbolic gesture, reaffirming the administration’s commitment to an 'America First' ideology at the expense of human rights. Global Repercussions: America’s Diminished Moral Standing The international fallout of this decision cannot be ignored. For years, the U.S. has positioned itself as a global leader in human rights advocacy, condemning authoritarian regimes for their treatment of refugees and political prisoners. Repurposing Guantánamo for migrant detention severely undermines this moral authority. How can the U.S. criticize China’s detention of Uighurs or Russia’s crackdowns on dissidents when it employs similar tactics against asylum seekers? This decision risks legitimizing harsh immigration policies worldwide, setting a dangerous precedent for countries looking to justify their own anti-migrant measures. Guantánamo Bay exists in a legal grey zone, where detainees have historically faced indefinite detention without due process. Applying this framework to migrants raises serious legal concerns. Can the administration detain asylum seekers indefinitely without trial? What legal recourse will detainees have? Civil rights organizations are likely to challenge this policy, arguing that it violates both U.S. constitutional protections and international human rights laws. The courts have historically been a check on the administration’s excesses, but whether they will intervene in this case remains uncertain. This policy evokes troubling historical parallels, from the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II to the family separations under the Trump administration. Time and again, the U.S. has implemented policies that treat certain groups as inherent threats, only to later acknowledge the moral failings of such actions. Is this another moment the country will one day regret? Rather than learning from past mistakes, this administration appears determined to repeat them, treating migrants as political pawns rather than human beings deserving of dignity and protection. Beyond the political and legal implications, there is an undeniable human cost to this policy. Migrants who arrive at the border seeking safety may now find themselves detained in an offshore prison with limited access to legal representation or medical care. Families may be separated indefinitely, children forced to endure conditions that could scar them for life. The psychological impact of detention at Guantánamo is well documented among terrorism suspects; imposing similar conditions on migrants risks long-term trauma that will persist for generations. A Call to Action: Resisting the Normalization of Injustice Congress, human rights organizations, and the American public must push back against this policy. While the Trump administration frames it as a logistical necessity, the reality is far more insidious: it is a deliberate effort to dehumanize migrants and dissuade asylum claims through fear. The courts may play a role in challenging this policy, but political pressure is essential. Americans must demand a more humane and rational immigration system—one that upholds the country’s founding principles rather than betraying them. Ultimately, this move is less about solving immigration challenges and more about political grandstanding. Trump’s fixation on dramatic, headline-grabbing gestures—whether it’s the border wall, mass deportation sweeps, or the militarization of immigration enforcement—has always prioritized optics over substance. The administration’s Guantánamo manoeuvre fits squarely within that pattern. It is designed to project toughness, to stoke the flames of anti-immigrant sentiment among Trump’s base, and to frame the border crisis as an existential threat requiring extreme measures. But in reality, it does little to address the root causes of migration—poverty, violence, climate change—nor does it provide a sustainable or humane solution to border management. If history has taught us anything, it is that policies born of fear and demagoguery rarely stand the test of time. The use of Guantánamo for migrants is a desperate attempt to institutionalize cruelty as governance, to equate immigration with terrorism, and to wield the machinery of war against the most vulnerable. It is a policy that, years from now, America may look back on with deep regret.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3bucw3SOG_ZyYT	2025-02-08T15:54:47-08:00	
DeepSeek, The New AI Cold War, And Its Implications For ASEAN – O...	From the US perspective, the DeepSeek phenomenon has set strategic alarm bells ringing. While it weakens US sanctions aimed at restricting China’s AI advancement, it emboldens emerging economies (this includes economies in the ASEAN region) to bypass US-based AI monopolies. A relatively unknown Chinese company recently unveiled DeepSeek, an open-source and cost-effective AI large language model (LLM). The release has signalled a significant shift in the global AI landscape as it has directly challenged the entrenched dominance of US-based AI giants such as OpenAI (GPT), Meta (Llama) and Google (Gemini). Developing a unique AI model is costly, especially if model is training from scratch. The costs depend on various factors such as infrastructure, data collection, training duration, fine-tuning, and deployment. DeepSeek has also demonstrated successfully that with proper management high-caliber AI models can be developed at a fraction of the traditional costs. The release of DeepSeek caused tremors in the US Stock market. Nvidia, a leading AI chip manufacturer experienced a record one-day loss of over $500 billion in market value. The fear was that DeepSeek's low-cost AI models might reduce the demand for high-end GPUs. Other major tech firms, including Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Meta, also saw steep decline in their stock prices. The US has employed restrained technological strategies that has restricted China to access to advanced semiconductor technology from firms like Nvidia GPUs and banning exports to entities involved in China’s AI development. In response, China pursued AI self-reliance which is exemplified by DeepSeek’s model. Their LLMs have been trained using just 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs—hardware that the US still permits China to import but at reduced capability. The success of DeepSeek has significantly undermined US efforts to cripple China’s AI ecosystem. Instead of retaliating directly by imposing similar counter measures, China has chosen to implement alternative approaches that could successfully circumvent US-imposed technological chokepoints. If ASEAN nations pivot toward China’s AI ecosystem, it could dilute US digital influence in the region. Hence to counterbalance DeepSeek’s growing reach, the US may look to strengthen AI partnerships with ASEAN via Quad and AUKUS digital initiatives. It could expand access to OpenAI and Google APIs for ASEAN startups and look to impose AI governance frameworks with an implicit aim to limit the spread of Chinese-trained AI models. While US is wary of these developments, for Beijing, DeepSeek is not merely a technological success—it is as well a geopolitical instrument too. China can export DeepSeek-based AI models to ASEAN nations at a fraction of cost creating digital dependencies and reinforcing Beijing’s technological dominance in Southeast Asia. By countering the Western-centric AI models that dominate global discourse, China could position DeepSeek as a ‘non-western’ AI alternative. Historically, ASEAN nations have pursued a kind of strategic hedging, that is, avoiding exclusive alignment with either the US or China. However, DeepSeek’s rise presents some strategic choices. For example, countries like Cambodia, Myanmar that has already aligned with Beijing to a good extent, could embrace DeepSeek and integrate it into government and corporate AI applications. Other countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam could proceed via AI partnerships. Here DeepSeek could be applied for low-cost AI applications while they could continue to maintain US partnerships for cutting-edge AI research. This way, it continues to mirror ASEAN’s broader 'neutrality strategy' in geopolitics. There is a chance that Singapore, the Philippines, and others may resist Chinese AI models, citing concerns over bias, misinformation, and surveillance risks. Nonetheless these nations could adopt EU-style AI regulations while ensuring Chinese-trained LLMs do not dominate their digital ecosystems. ASEAN nations will have to move with full steam if they have to accomplish the task of developing their own competitive LLMs. They must reduce dependence on US and for this they gave to invest heavily in cloud-based AI services within domestic AI clusters. Also, nations in this region could create AI models that are bespoke for local languages (i.e. Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Malaysia, Thai, Khmer, or for that matter, Vietnamese). This way they would in a position to move way and stop their reliance on English-trained models. A regional ASEAN AI initiative that works collaboratively with ASEAN nations could pool resources to develop an indigenous LLM for Southeast Asia. With DeepSeek we are seeing a fundamental shift in AI geopolitics that allows for a cost-efficient AI development outside the US-dominated AI ecosystem. Here I see a good opportunity as well as challenges for Southeast Asia. While the Deepseek phenomenon lowers the barrier to AI entry, making regional AI independence more feasible, it also creates a new arena for US-China digital competition within ASEAN. ASEAN governments would be forced to carefully navigate AI dependencies, ensuring that they do not become over-reliant on either Washington or Beijing. If ASEAN nations seize this moment, it could transform passive consumers into active contributors in the AI revolution. However, if they fail to act, they risk becoming mere battlegrounds in the digital Cold War between the US and China.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeoKez5Pj3bufSsGeDso5kF	2025-02-08T15:50:10-08:00
