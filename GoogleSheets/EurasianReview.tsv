NATO Foreign Ministers Chart Way Forward In Addressing Russian Sa...	NATO Foreign Ministers wrapped up two days of meetings in Brussels on Wednesday (December 4) addressing Russia’s escalating campaign of hostile actions in NATO countries. At their meeting on Wednesday, Allies considered a set of measures to counter Russia’s actions against NATO and individual Allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte said that 'both Russia and China have tried to destabilise our countries and divide our societies with acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, and energy blackmail'. Rutte noted that Ministers agreed a set of measures to counter Russia’s hostile and cyber activities, including enhanced intelligence exchange, more exercises, better protection of critical infrastructure, improved cyber defence, and tougher action against Russia’s 'shadow fleet' of oil exporting ships. He further stressed that NATO 'will work closely together with the EU on these issues'. Rutte underscored that the increasing alignment of Russia, China, North Korea and Iran highlights the global nature of the threats we face, including the escalating dangers of the ongoing war in Ukraine. He noted that in return for troops and weapons, Russia is providing North Korea with support for its missile and nuclear programmes. 'These developments could destabilise the Korean Peninsula and even threaten the United States. So Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine threatens us all', he said. During the two-day meeting NATO Allies also met with His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan to discuss the situation in the Middle East and the importance of NATO cooperating even more closely with its partners in the region. The Secretary General thanked the King of Jordan for his personal leadership and support to the Alliance and noted that NATO will open a Liaison Office in Amman soon to further deepen these ties. NATO Ministers also met with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and with Kaja Kallas, the new EU High Representative, in the NATO-Ukraine Council. They discussed Ukraine’s most urgent needs, as well as what more Allies can do to provide critical ammunition and air defences, as Russia steps up its attacks and expands the war with the aid of North Korean troops and weapons. Rutte noted that continued support for Ukraine is a priority, ensuring that, when the time comes, Ukraine can negotiate peace from a position of strength. He further highlighted how NATO is delivering on its commitments, including through a financial pledge and the new command in Wiesbaden, NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine. The Secretary General stressed that 'we must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight. We must provide enough support to change the trajectory of this conflict once and for all'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGs9wX54-SOUy0Y_-Ca0MU	2024-12-04T09:19:29-08:00	
Saudi Arabia: ‘Giga-Projects’ Built On Widespread Labor Abuses, S...	Migrant workers in Saudi Arabia are facing widespread abuses across employment sectors and geographic regions, including at high-profile giga-projects funded by or linked to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Wednesday. FIFA, the international football organization, is set to confirm Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 Men’s World Cup on December 11, without requiring proper human rights due diligence and binding commitments to prevent labor and other abuses, according to HRW. The 79-page report, '‘Die First, and I’ll Pay You Later’: Saudi Arabia’s ‘Giga-Projects’ Built on Widespread Labor Abuses,' documents widespread abuses against migrant workers, some of which may amount to situations of forced labor, including exorbitant recruitment fees, rampant wage theft, inadequate protections from extreme heat, restrictions on transferring jobs, and uninvestigated worker deaths. Saudi authorities have systematically failed to prevent or remedy these abuses, including at high-profile projects financed by its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). 'The human engine powering the construction of Saudi Arabia’s multibillion dollar giga-projects is the migrant workforce, who are facing widespread rights violations in Saudi Arabia without any recourse,' said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. 'FIFA’s fake evaluation processto award the 2034 World Cup without legally binding human rights commitments will come at an unimaginable human cost, including adverse intergenerational impacts on migrant workers and their families.' The report is based on interviews with more than 155 former and current migrant workers and families of deceased workers across employment sectors and regions. Migrant workers in Saudi Arabia face widespread labor abuses at every point in the migration cycle, Human Rights Watch found. The abuses start from the time companies recruit workers and illegally force them to pay exorbitant recruitment fees and continue with employers in Saudi Arabia violating their employment contracts by failing to honor the terms of employment and benefits stipulated in the contract. 'I was paid on time for the first two months, but never thereafter,' one migrant worker said. 'When I asked my manager for payment, he would answer: ‘Die first, and I’ll pay you later.’' Despite Saudi Arabia’s 2021 Labor Reform Initiative that claimed to make it easier for migrant workers to transfer to a different employer and leave the country freely, migrant workers continue to face barriers to mobility that abusive employers often exploit. 'I was told to take the exit permit, leave the country, and remigrate to another company,' one worker said. 'They [the employer] said: ‘If we let you transfer sponsorship, we will have to let others do so as well.’' Other employers forced workers to sign an agreement to pay their employer if they moved to a new job. Workers who did manage to change jobs also were forced to pay their former employers. One worker employed at a NEOM project—a PIF-funded giga-project that is being built in the northwest of Saudi Arabia—said he paid his previous employer more than 12,000 riyals (about US$3,200) to change jobs. Many migrant workers also often lack the awareness and technical know-how necessary to navigate online employment contract management services. They struggle to understand their rights under the nuances of Saudi Arabia’s labor laws and cannot access support via Saudi authorities or their origin countries’ embassies. The giga-projects often impose unrealistic, tight deadlines for projects, which translates to additional pressure on workers. Many workers are also isolated from support networks such as embassies or well-established migrant diaspora groups. One NEOM-based worker said: 'We are in the middle of nowhere. Embassies are very far away. If something goes wrong, there is nowhere we can go. There is also fear. Where do we go? Who do we tell?' The number of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia, 13.4 million, is expected to increase significantly, with planned mega- and giga-projects that will require massive new construction. Employers also expose workers to serious dangers at job sites, including abuses linked to extreme heat for outdoor workers that are likely to increase as climate change accelerates. A worker employed at a NEOM project said: 'Every day, one or two workers faint, including during mornings and evenings. Sometimes on the way to work. Sometimes while working.' Abuses linked to extreme heat can cause lasting and potentially lethal health harms to migrant workers, including organ failure. According to government data obtained by Human Rights Watch, 884 Bangladeshis died in Saudi Arabia between January 2024 and July 2024, of which 80 percent of the deaths were attributed to 'natural causes.' Many migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are unexplained, uninvestigated, and uncompensated, leaving families of deceased migrant workers without financial support. The wife of a deceased Indian plumber told Human Rights Watch: 'He did not have any health issues. We do not believe that he died of natural death as is mentioned in the death certificate. The death was not investigated properly.' She added: 'He used to send approximately $536 [KA1] every month to cover family expenses, education, and outstanding loans. After his death, we are in a state of destitution.' Human Rights Watch also spoke to seven former migrant workers who had previously worked in Saudi Arabia who are now dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease. The wife of one patient told Human Rights Watch that her husband’s dialysis was covered by the Nepali government, but she was unable to afford medicine or pay for their children’s school fees in the last six months. She said: 'The [Saudi] company did not provide any assistance beyond booking his [return] ticket.' While Saudi authorities have the primary obligation to protect human rights, including labor rights, businesses also have internationally recognized responsibilities to respect human rights and avoid complicity in abuses. The pervasive enforcement gaps in Saudi laws intended to protect migrant workers require urgent attention. However, as this report documents, while noncompliance needs to be addressed, compliance alone is also not sufficient in Saudi Arabia’s context, where many laws themselves fail by design to meet international norms and the country’s obligations under international human rights instruments, Human Rights Watch said. Saudi Arabia’s 2034 Men’s World Cup bid submitted to FIFA failed to adequately report and address rights abuses prevalent in the country and to offer any concrete assurances that the abuses will be addressed, despite the massive construction required, including 11 new and four refurbished stadiums; more than 185,000 new hotel rooms; and significant airport, road, rail, and bus network expansion. FIFA has engineered the World Cup hosting process to ignore the blatant human rights risks, including a forced labor complaint against Saudi Arabia filed by the global trade union Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI) at the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2024. Human Rights Watch wrote to FIFA on November 4, 2024, sharing findings and documentation of widespread and serious labor rights abuses linked to mega- and giga-projects in Saudi Arabia. FIFA has not responded. 'Saudi authorities, who are spending billions to launder their abominable human rights reputation, would be better served by effectively implementing labor reforms they’ve promised but so far failed to deliver on,' Page said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGs9wX54-SOdHO0TwJO-yn	2024-12-04T09:17:16-08:00	
Pentagon Confirms Centcom Destroyed Weapons Systems In Syria	By Matthew Olay U.S. Central Command on Tuesday successfully engaged and destroyed several weapon systems that posed a threat to U.S. and coalition forces in Syria, the Defense Department announced. The weapons destroyed — which included three truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers, a T-64 tank and multiple mortars — presented a 'clear and imminent threat' to U.S. and coalition forces in the vicinity of eastern Syria's Mission Support Site Euphrates, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told the media. 'The self-defense strike occurred after the mobile multiple rocket launchers fired rockets that landed in the vicinity of MSS Euphrates, and mortars were fired toward U.S. forces,' Ryder said. He added that, while DOD is still assessing who was operating the weapons, Iranian-backed militia groups are operating in the region that have attacked MSS Euphrates in the past. Tuesday's incident was the second time in less than a week that Centcom forces were used to neutralize a hostile threat in the region. On Nov. 29, Centcom employed A-10 fighter aircraft to successfully engage a hostile target that imposed a threat to U.S. and coalition forces at MSS Euphrates. 'Individuals were observed preparing a rocket rail,' Ryder said of the threat. 'These self-defense actions likewise eliminated threats to our personnel at MSS Euphrates,' he added. When questioned as to whether either of the past week's engagements was indicative of Centcom working with the Syrian Democratic Forces as part of the greater civil war going on throughout the region, Ryder repeatedly made clear that U.S. forces in the region are primarily focused on protecting their own personnel and partnering with the SDF to counter ISIS. 'To be clear, these self-defense actions successfully eliminated imminent threats to U.S. personnel and were not linked to any broader activities in northwest Syria by other groups,' Ryder said. 'Our focus is on protecting our forces and also preserving our efforts to conduct counter-ISIS operations in partnership with the SDF,' he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf41W35neU5tJZu6DvfQeav	2024-12-04T09:15:44-08:00	
Robert Reich: Pardon Me – OpEd	My first reaction to the Sunday news that President Biden was pardoning his son Hunter was sadness. Biden has a constitutional right to pardon his son, and I can understand his concern that Trump’s overt aim to use the Justice Department and FBI to pursue 'retribution' against political enemies might subject Hunter to further charges and harassment. House Republicans have claimed Hunter is guilty of more than the felonies he was charged with: lying on a firearms application form about his drug addiction and failing to pay taxes that he later did pay. My sadness comes from President Biden’s suggestion that the charges against his son were influenced by Republican politicians. 'It is clear that Hunter was treated differently,' he wrote. 'The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.' Biden continued: 'There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.' I can understand President Biden’s frustration, but his claim that Republican politicians were responsible for Hunter’s legal problems lends credence to Trump’s long-term claim that the justice system was 'weaponized' against him and that he was the victim of selective prosecution, as Biden says his son was. Biden’s claim also makes it more difficult for Democrats to stand against Trump’s plans to use the Justice Department for political purposes as Trump seeks to install as director of the FBI the cringeworthy sycophant Kash Patel, who has vowed to 'come after' Trump’s enemies. Of course, we know that the prosecution of Hunter Biden was completely different from the prosecutions of Trump. Many legal experts agree with President Biden’s contention that his son’s offenses wouldn’t normally have resulted in felony charges. Trump, on the other hand, was charged with near treasonous actions — illegally seeking to overturn the results of an election he lost in order to hold on to power, and endangering national security and trying to obstruct justice by taking classified documents when he left office and refusing to return them. These cases are being dropped because of his election. But in suggesting that the charges against his son were politically motivated, President Biden has handed Trump something of a Trump card for arguing that of course the Justice Department is used for political ends, so watch me do the same. Biden’s pardon also makes it more difficult for Democrats to criticize Trump for his use of the pardoning power to immunize friends and allies, at least one of whom he’s now appointing to an important diplomatic role. Almost immediately after the news broke of President Biden’s pardon for Hunter, Trump used it to justify his planned pardon of the January 6 rioters. 'Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?' he wrote on social media. 'Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!' Among the people Trump pardoned in his final weeks in office was Charles Kushner, the father of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spent two years in prison on tax evasion and other charges. Over the weekend, Trump announced he would nominate the pardoned Kushner to be ambassador to France. ** There’s a larger issue here. The pardoning power was never supposed to be a means for presidents to put themselves, their families, members of their administration, and campaign staff above the law. Yet that’s precisely what it has become. Bill Clinton pardoned his brother, Roger, on old drug charges. George H.W. Bush pardoned former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and others in his administration on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. As the framers of the Constitution saw it, the pardoning power was supposed to be a safety valve against injustice. The origins of the power in the United States Constitution are found in the 'prerogative of mercy' that originally appeared during the reign of King Ine of Wessex in the seventh century. George Washington first exercised the power in 1795, granting amnesty to those engaged in Pennsylvania’s Whiskey Rebellion. Thomas Jefferson granted amnesty to any citizen convicted of a crime under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Lincoln used clemency to encourage desertions from the Confederate Army. In 1868, President Andrew Jackson pardoned Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederacy. In another act of mercy, President Warren G. Harding commuted the sentences of 24 political prisoners, including socialist leader Eugene Debs. But in what was clearly a political use of the pardon rather than a use for humanitarian reasons, Nixon commuted the sentence of James Hoffa, former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and a Nixon ally who was convicted for pension fund fraud and jury tampering. Gerald Ford’s 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon was arguably the most famous exercise of executive clemency in American history. Ford explained that he granted the pardon as an act of mercy to Nixon and for the broader purpose of restoring domestic tranquility in the nation after Watergate. We need a constitutional amendment to prevent the continuing misuse of the pardoning power. Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee’s 9th District, has repeatedly introduced just such an amendment, which would prohibit a self-pardon and pardons of family members, administration officials, and campaign employees. It would also bar the president from issuing pardons to those whose crimes were committed to further a direct and significant personal interest of the president or others close to him or her, and those whose crimes were committed at the direction of, or in coordination with, the president. Cohen’s proposed amendment deserves widespread support. What do you think?

Brazil’s Supreme Court Sentences 310 For January 8 Coup Acts	By Andre Richter The Federal Supreme Court has convicted 310 individuals for their involvement in the January 8, 2023, coup acts. The Attorney General's Office, responsible for filing the charges, released the figure on Tuesday (Nov. 3). According to the prosecutor's office, nearly two years after the events, 229 individuals have been convicted as direct participants and 81 as instigators of the coup acts. The sentences for the perpetrators range from 15 to 17 years in prison for crimes including armed criminal association, aggravated damage, destruction of protected heritage, violent disruption of the democratic rule of law, and attempted coup d'état. For those accused of inciting the acts, the sentences are one year in prison but have been commuted to community service and mandatory participation in a democracy education course. The convicted individuals will also have their passports confiscated, firearm licenses revoked, and are required to pay a collective moral damages penalty of BRL 5 million, jointly and severally. According to the Attorney General's Office, 500 defendants have entered into non-prosecution agreements, resulting in the closure of their cases. The agreement allows defendants who were not directly involved in the acts of vandalism against Congress, the Planalto presidential palace, and the Supreme Court to admit their crimes in exchange for alternative penalties to imprisonment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLrQPDc48U0-THqhU8ytQd	2024-12-04T09:11:56-08:00	
Jewish And Muslim Children Besieged By Christmas Selling Season –...	Jewish and Muslim children, from an early age, have become increasingly immersed in the national and religious culture of the Christian world around them. The natural tendency of most children to desire to 'fit in'; leads many Jewish and Muslim children to want to copy non-traditional ways in general, and popular Christmas party practices in particular. Each year December becomes the month when many non-Christian children feel left out if they do not participate in Christmas school celebrations; or they have mixed conflicting emotions if they do participate. Over the last three or four generations, Hanukah has increasingly become an important holiday for Jewish families during the heavily commercialized Christmas selling season; because there is lots of pressure from well meaning Christians to get everyone, including Jews and Muslims, to join in all sorts of Christmas cultural and religious activities. In previous generations, the ancestors of most of these children went to Islamic or Jewish schools, lived in Jewish or Muslim neighborhoods, and had very little contact with Christian children. This all changed in the 20th century, especially after WW2, when the commercialization of Christmas, and the Christmas selling season, became universal and ubiquitous. This excessive commercialization of Christmas now threatens Christian children themselves by offering a crass materialistic and superficial experience of what should be a wonder-filled spiritual celebration. Fortunately, the post Biblical previously minor eight day Jewish Holiday of Hanukah occurs during December. Hanukah, with its celebration of the value of standing up and fighting (jihad) for your right to be a nonconformist who is different from the majority, and your freedom to celebrate your own religious laws and traditions, became an important event in the education of Jewish children to be proud of their own religious heritage. It can serve Muslims and even religious Christians as well. In the two thousand years from Jesus in the first century to Jews in the twenty-first century Hanukah, the Festival of Lights, has been the celebration of the victory of a religious minority over an oppressive government. Jerusalem then and now was ablaze in light, as each Jewish family burned oil lamps then and candles now at the doors and windows of their houses. Today Jews still celebrate this festival with a nine candlestick menorah—one for each of the eight days that the pure olive oil did not burn out, and the elevated candlestick called the 'servant candle' which is used to light each of the eight others. As the one and only God's prophet Isaiah (42:1) stated: 'My servant shall bring light to the Gentiles.' When Jews kindle the Hanukah candles (this year (2024) from the evening of December 25 to January 2ed. 2025) they will be celebrating two kinds of dedication. Hanukah (Hebrew for Dedication) celebrates the joyful rededication of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem after it was profaned in 168 BCE by an idol installed in it by the Syrian Greek king Antiochus IV (who named himself: 'Manifest God'). In addition, recent attempts to outlaw circumcision in California, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and other places, by people who think it is a barbaric custom, follow the path of the Syrian Greek king Antiochus IV, whose decree outlawing circumcision was the final outrage that led to the revolt of the Maccabees. All of this can be easily understood by religious people in general; and in particular by first, second and third generation Muslim families living as a small minority in the West, whose ancestors grew up in Muslim majority countries, and never had children facing these kinds of pressures. In 169 BCE the Greek rulers of the Syrian Empire, decided to prohibit Jews from circumcising their sons, as part of a government program to make Jews conform to Greek standards of civilized behavior. Greek pressure on Jews to 'fit in' culturally had some limited success with many wealthy Jews and with some of the upper levels of the government appointed leaders of the priesthood in Jerusalem. Then the Greek King ordered that a statue of himself be placed in the courtyard of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. That led to a revolt which broke out in 168 BCE in the small village of Modin, led by a man called Judah the Maccabee (hammerer), and his four brothers. With trust in God, the five Maccabee brothers (four of who were killed in battle over the next two decades) defeated the much larger Syrian Greek armies, recaptured Jerusalem and rededicated (Hanukah) the desecrated Jerusalem Temple in an eight day festival. Judah Maccabee ordered the Temple to be purified, and a new altar built in place of the one that had been polluted by pig's blood. According to the Torah (Leviticus 24:2), pure olive oil was needed for the two menorahs in the Temple, which were required to burn day and night throughout the year. However, there was only enough unpolluted oil found to burn for one day, and it would take a week to prepare a fresh supply of ritually pure oil for the menorah. Some said: Delay the Hanukah of the Temple for a week. Others said: Kindle the Temple Menorah now, and trust that it will last until new pure oil can be made. The menorah was lit; and it did not go out prior to the arrival of the new oil. An eight-day festival was declared to commemorate this miracle. Thus the Hanukah story is about two kinds of battle; the physical struggle against others (political and sometimes military); and the spiritual struggle within ourselves to trust in God, and never yield to despair; or abandon hope for the future (kindling the oil). Hanukah- the Festival of Freedom celebrating the religious duty to say 'NO' to the unjust demands of a dictatorial government, is still celebrated to this day in Jewish homes by reciting blessings, lighting candles, singing songs and retelling the ancient story with its modern lessons. The oppression of Judaism by Antiochus IV, the Syrian Greek king, was the first known attempt at suppressing a minority religion, but unfortunately not the last. Other well known attempts were the three century long Roman persecution of Christianity, and the persecution of Muhammad and his followers by the majority of pagan Arabs in Makkah. All three religions emerged from their varying periods of persecution stronger than ever. And this is the ongoing spiritual lesson of the Hanukah lights. Once lit by faithful believers, filled with hope and trust in God; its flames last longer than anyone else thinks possible. Indeed, the light of the Hanukah flames has long outlasted the powerful oppressors themselves.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLrQPDc48U0z46oU3y27m3	2024-12-04T09:08:37-08:00	
The Sephardic Jews And The Contribution Of A Language To Business...	A friend of mine, who spends summers on the Princes' Islands, is a descendant of Sephardic Jews who fled the Spanish Inquisition in 1492 and settled in the Ottoman Empire. He studied at Galatasaray High School, received a degree from Istanbul University's Faculty of Business Administration, and now successfully runs a medium-sized enterprise. At home, he speaks Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) with his family, while also being fluent in Turkish, French, and English. One day, a high school friend who works in the same industry approached him with a proposal: 'I'll cover the travel expenses; let's go to Spain. Help me with business negotiations, and you'll benefit too.' Though he had never been to Spain before, my friend accepted the offer. Ladino's Surprise After arriving in Spain, they began partnership discussions the next day. During the meetings, which were conducted in French and English, my friend noticed the Spaniards conversing among themselves. To his astonishment, the language they were speaking was none other than Ladino, the same language he grew up speaking with his family. At dinner that evening, he mustered the courage to address his Spanish counterparts in their language. The Spaniards were surprised by his choice of words—terms that appeared in Cervantes' Don Quixote and other classic literature but were no longer used in modern Spanish. This unexpected linguistic connection eased the tense and formal atmosphere of the meetings, fostering better communication and ultimately facilitating an agreement. Citizenship and Language Advantage In recent years, Spain has granted citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews who fled during the Inquisition. Many Turkish Sephardic Jewish businesspeople have benefited from this law, gaining dual citizenship by proving their ancestry through synagogue records. They also acquired the right to move freely within the European Union. The language requirement for citizenship was easily met thanks to their fluency in Judeo-Spanish. The Examples of Yiddish and Azerbaijani Turkish This story highlights the importance of historical linguistic ties. In Central Europe, Ashkenazi Jews speak Yiddish, a language closely related to medieval German. Hearing Yiddish in conversation often feels like listening to German from centuries ago. Similarly, Azerbaijani Turkish closely resembles the Ottoman Turkish of old and the language of classical divan literature. Following Turkey's language reform, which significantly simplified Turkish, Azerbaijani Turkish now evokes the style of Ottoman-era writers. I recall a similar feeling when listening to an elderly Armenian woman in Istanbul whose speech skillfully incorporated old Ottoman literary expressions. The Importance of Cultural Heritage This story demonstrates that language is not just a tool for communication but also a powerful vehicle for preserving cultural heritage and fostering connections in business. Languages like Judeo-Spanish, passed down through generations, not only keep our ties to the past alive but also open doors to new opportunities. Languages and cultures are vital components of a society's identity. Preserving them is essential for maintaining the richness of human history and the diversity of our world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe1dG1dhyb_WfhBwoJEp7KJ	2024-12-04T09:07:00-08:00	
The New European Military Path: Strategic ‘Emancipation’ From The...	The future of the EU will depend largely on how it responds to internal and external challenges. In this context, the two Albanian republics together — political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo — must focus on survival in the anarchic system of international relations. In the regular hearing, yesterday in the European Parliament, before the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Industry, Research and Energy, the EU Commissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius, stated that the European Union is facing numerous existential threats, recalling as a fact conventional warfare, hybrid attacks and the militarization of space, Euronews reports. See for this he called for the provision of 10 billion euros by 2028 to strengthen European defense. He also stressed that 700 billion euros were needed for the development of infrastructure and an EU air defence shield.[1] Highlighting insufficient investment in the defence sector and the fragmented European market for military equipment, he warned that strategic rivals such as China and Russia were overtaking the bloc in defence spending. In this context, Kubilius called on European lawmakers to support efforts to create a genuine European Defence Union. 1. The EU Common Arms Market The Common Arms Market in the European Union is an initiative that aims to strengthen the defence capabilities of the member states and increase the strategic autonomy of the EU. In recent years, especially after various geopolitical crises, the EU has pursued policies of deeper cooperation in the field of defence, which include better coordination of the production, acquisition and use of armaments. The Common Arms Market in the European Union is an initiative that aims to strengthen the defence capabilities of the member states and increase the strategic autonomy of the EU. In recent years, especially after various geopolitical crises, the EU has pursued policies of deeper cooperation in the field of defence, which include better coordination of the production, acquisition and use of armaments. Pooling resources and harmonising technical standards for weapons and military equipment can reduce costs for member states and eliminate duplication of effort. The goal is to create a more competitive and independent arms and military technology manufacturing sector, reducing dependence on the US and other suppliers outside the EU.[2] On July 29, the RAND Corporation, a Pentagon-funded think tank, released a comprehensive assessment of the state of the US military and Washington’s National Defense Strategy (NDS) to 2022, prepared by a panel of 'non-governmental national security experts' established by Congress. The RAND report is a critical, relentless, and bleak analysis of the US military apparatus, concluding that the US is 'not at all prepared' for serious competition with major global adversaries and is 'vulnerable or even comparable' in almost every modern sphere of warfare.[3] In these circumstances, when Donald Trump is expected to arrive in the White House in January, we will witness an unusual phase of the late period of the American empire, comparable to the last years of the Soviet Union, in which military analysts with clear insight admit that Washington's hegemony is rapidly weakening on the global stage, which is also expected to pave the way for the 'officialization' of the New World Order. European experts in the field, see for example, have advocated for the harmonization of military equipment, since only in this way can the armies of different countries act more easily together in case of need, increasing the operational effectiveness of joint forces. Through these policies, the EU aims to improve collective security by better preparing itself for global challenges and threats in the region. Steps that have been taken:• Harmonization of Standards and creation of common certification mechanisms for military equipment. • European Defence Budget, partly financed by the EU, to support joint development and production projects. • Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) initiatives, which include various joint projects for the development of defence capabilities. The return of Donald Trump to the US presidency could have a major impact on the foreign policy and security of the European Union. Trump has often criticized European allies for their low contributions to NATO and has pushed for more independence for Europe in the field of defence. Thus, his return could push the EU towards accelerating a common defence policy and towards the creation of a more independent defence structure. During his first term, Trump had a more pragmatic and sometimes withdrawn approach towards transatlantic allies, favouring the policy he had also promoted during the 'America First' campaign. This has prompted some European leaders to seek strategic 'emancipation' from the US, to avoid being entirely dependent on American support. As a result, the EU is encouraged to develop its own defense capabilities to counter external threats, especially given the tense situation with Russia and the instability of the Middle East region. '[The Russians] can produce [within] six months everything that Germany has in stock,' he said at the start of a three-hour question from MEPs, adding: 'This should be a warning signal to all of us,'[4] Politico reports. The EU, without competing with NATO, should help develop the capabilities and resources needed to implement NATO’s military deterrence and defense plans, he said. Stressing the need to 'spend more, spend better, spend together as a European community' on defence, Kubilius said that 'we must achieve a true single market for defence'. Doing so seems at first glance an ambitious undertaking. Plans for an air defence system worth more than €500 billion would have to be negotiated within the EU in all member state capitals, who would have to say how much they were prepared to commit to such an effort. There is also a plan for a ground defence network across the bloc’s eastern flank that would require billions in further investment. But the ambitious plan does not end there. Kubilius estimated that around €200 billion would be needed over the next decade for improvements to allow tanks and troops to move easily across the EU on roads and railways. 2. Europe’s ‘space revolution’ The 'space revolution' in Europe involves major projects and developments that are changing the way space technologies are used and understood. The European Union (EU) has invested significantly in this area to improve Europe’s security, economy, and technological sustainability. Here are some of the key EU projects that could be markers of Europe’s 'space revolution': 2. 1 Galileo Galileo is the European satellite navigation system, an alternative to the US’s GPS and Russia’s GLONASS. The system provides precise positioning and timing for civilian users worldwide and increases the security of communications for critical applications such as traffic monitoring and emergency operations. Galileo is Europe's Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and has been operational since December 2016. It provides accurate and reliable positioning and timing information, which is used in devices such as smartphones, but also in other applications and sectors of the economy such as railways, aviation, agriculture, maritime and more. Galileo consists of 24 satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 23,000 km. Galileo's signals are broadcast freely to anyone with a device capable of receiving its signals (e.g. smartphone). Galileo is three times more accurate than GPS, offering 1 meter accuracy and a wide range of services.[5] 2. 2 Copernicus The Copernicus programme includes satellites and other technologies for monitoring the Earth, providing data on climate, environment, marine, agriculture and natural resource management. Copernicus is the Earth observation component of the European Union's Space Programme, looking at our planet and its environment in the interests of all European citizens. It provides information services drawing on satellite Earth observation and in-situ (non-space) data. The European Commission manages the Programme. It is implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Océan, the European Environment Agency (EEA), the Joint Research Centre (JRC).[6] This technological advancement also has a significant impact on the political future of the European Union (EU), especially now that Brussels is facing its own challenges, but also new opportunities, driven by a mix of internal tensions, geopolitical changes and changing priorities. Some key aspects of the EU’s future prospects include: • Strengthening integration and institutional reforms Deeper cooperation: To remain globally competitive and overcome internal challenges, the EU may increasingly rely on deeper integration. This could include greater alignment in areas such as taxation, social policy and defence. Majority decision-making: A central point of contention is whether the EU should move to majority decision-making in foreign policy and other sensitive areas in order to speed up decision-making processes. Institutional reforms: There are discussions about reforming the EU institutions to adapt them to a larger and more diverse union. One could imagine a stronger role for the European Parliament and a more efficient administration.• European autonomy and strategic sovereignty Why is this sovereignty increasingly important, especially now that geopolitical realignments are on the horizon? Discussions about the concept of European strategic autonomy are not new, and even less so in this period when the possibility of Donald Trump’s return to power was being discussed. Its authors and interpreters have already provided exhaustive explanations of what exactly is meant by this concept and how it can help Europeans take their fate into their own hands in an increasingly harsh world. Some believe that strategic autonomy is a concept that should be strengthened to the extreme, especially after Donald Trump’s victory. Others see it as a political imperative that must be put into practice more than anything else, regardless of who is in the White House. In between, there are those who believe that we should avoid the old theological arguments and fill the term with practical content. I share this view, Joseph Borell expresses in an essay. He goes on to explain that the term is not new. 'Strategic autonomy' has long been part of the EU’s common language. The term was coined in the defense industry and was for a long time limited to defense and security issues. And that is part of the problem. [7] Independence from global superpowers: The EU is working to find an independent role between the US and China. This can be seen in projects such as the European Defense Initiative and the desired energy sovereignty. Resilient supply chains: The coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical tensions have pushed the EU to diversify its supply chains and seek strategic independence in areas such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and raw materials. • Migration and social cohesion Migration as a core issue: The EU faces the challenge of developing a common migration policy. Tensions between member states over the distribution of refugees and migrants make it difficult to resolve. Integration and social tensions: Dealing with migration and integration is essential for social cohesion. The EU must find ways to make cultural diversity and integration harmonious. Environment and climate policy The EU Green Deal: The EU Green Deal is at the heart of the Union’s future climate policy. The EU aims to be climate neutral by 2050, which requires extensive reforms and investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and transport. Energy crisis and transition: Given the energy crisis and geopolitical dependence on energy sources, the EU needs to accelerate its energy diversification and investment in renewable energy. • Populism and nationalism Intra-European tensions: The rise of populist movements in some member states poses a challenge to the unity of nationalist EU governments and could hinder efforts to deepen EU integration and exacerbate conflicts on issues such as the rule of law and media freedom. Political fragmentation: The EU faces increasing political fragmentation, which can make it difficult to decide on and implement joint actions. • Technological development and digitalisation Digital sovereignty: The EU is striving for greater digital independence in order to be less dependent on big tech companies from the US and China. This includes developing our own digital infrastructures, data centres and technologies. Data protection and AI regulation: The EU can play a leading role in regulating artificial intelligence and data protection to set ethical and social standards and protect the digital rights of its citizens. The future of the EU will largely depend on how it responds to internal and external challenges. Whether it moves towards a stronger political union or allows for more flexible models of cooperation will be crucial to ensuring stability, prosperity and global influence in dealing with natural emergencies and monitoring climate change. 2.3 Space Security Programme The EU is also developing a space security programme that includes protecting satellite infrastructure from risks such as space debris and cyber-attacks. This is an effort to ensure that Europe’s space infrastructure remains secure and protected from external interference and threats. 2.4 NewSpace Initiative The EU has also encouraged the development of the private sector in space, including 'NewSpace,' which supports new and innovative companies in the space field. This includes startups that develop new technologies for launching rockets, developing small satellites and providing services for specific missions. 2.5 IRIS² Constellation IRIS² is a recent project that aims to build a constellation of satellites to ensure secure communications in Europe and improve internet connectivity in rural and remote regions. This project is being considered an essential element to increase Europe’s technological autonomy and strengthen cybersecurity. These projects are part of the EU’s strategy to develop its space capabilities, increase technological independence and influence global innovation in the field of space. *** To expand the range of investments in this plan, the EU Commissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius, insisted in this hearing that we mentioned above that Europe must be part of the 'space revolution'. The EU must continue to improve its major space programmes and work to ensure autonomous European access to space, he affirmed in this traditional briefing. The European Investment Bank’s lending policies could evolve and the next multiannual financial framework should have larger spending lines for defence and space, he added. Brussels is also expected to publish a law, namely the EU Space Act, to promote global standards for thousands of satellites in orbit; promote the economy of space data collection; and strengthen the protection of EU space assets for 'the most extreme military contingencies'. The Space Act, warned EU Commissioner Andrius Kubilius, will be a major part of his legislative agenda until 2025, and is likely to set standards to curb light pollution caused by mega-satellite constellations and limit greenhouse gas emissions and pollution caused by rocket launches. The EU currently spends around €2 billion a year on space, he said, but just maintaining services in existing programmes like Galileo will require 'much more significant funding' from the budget — so expect more talks on space allocations in the coming months, adding at the end of this hearing that: 'Space is still untapped for defence.' But can the EU’s common arms market, the space revolution… be guaranteed without the EU’s strategic 'emancipation' from the US? The political future of the European Union (EU) in the context of geopolitical developments and the expected return of Donald Trump to White House is expected to face unpredictable challenges, but also opportunities, imposed by a mix of internal tensions, geopolitical changes and changing priorities. All of this is linked to several factors: • Strengthening integration and institutional reforms To remain globally competitive and to overcome internal challenges, the EU may increasingly rely on deeper integration and cooperation among member states. This could include greater alignment in areas such as taxation, social policy and defence. A central point of contention is whether the EU should move to majority voting in foreign policy and other sensitive areas in order to speed up decision-making processes. This issue goes through deep institutional reforms. There are serious discussions about reforming the EU institutions to adapt them to this existing union and to full enlargement, especially with the six countries of South-Eastern Europe: Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, but also with the two countries of Eastern Europe: Ukraine and Moldova. A stronger role for the European Parliament and a more efficient administration can be imagined. • European autonomy and strategic sovereignty Independence from superpowers: the EU is working to find an independent role between the US and China. This can be seen in projects such as the European Defence Initiative and the desired energy sovereignty. The coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical tensions have pushed the EU to diversify its supply chains and seek strategic independence in areas such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and raw materials. • Migration and social cohesion Migration is seen as a crucial issue. The EU faces the challenge of developing a common migration policy. Tensions between member states over the distribution of refugees and migrants make it difficult to resolve. Dealing with migration and integration is essential for social cohesion. The EU must find ways to make cultural diversity and integration harmonious. • Environment and climate policy The EU Green Deal is at the heart of its future climate policy. The EU aims to be climate neutral by 2050, which requires extensive reforms and investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and transport. Given the energy crisis and geopolitical dependence on energy sources, the EU needs to accelerate its energy diversification and investments in renewable energy. • Neo-fascism: a wake-up call The rise of populist movements with strong elements of neo-fascism in some member states poses a challenge to the unity of nationalist EU governments, which could hinder efforts to deepen EU integration and exacerbate conflicts on issues such as the rule of law and media freedom. The case of Hungary is a specific example. The rise of neo-fascism is expected to deepen political fragmentation on a scale that threatens the future of the EU. • Technological development and digitalization The EU is striving for greater digital independence in order to be less dependent on big tech companies from the US and China. This includes developing our digital infrastructures, data centers and technologies. In this context, the EU can play a leading role in regulating artificial intelligence and data protection to set ethical and social standards and to protect the digital rights of its citizens. 3. Transatlantic developments and Albanians On the transatlantic front, political, economic and security developments also have direct impacts on Albanians, especially considering the close ties of political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo with the United States and the European Union. Albania is already a NATO member state and is currently taking real steps towards EU accession. The Republic of Kosovo has also applied for EU membership. Whether this is the path that should be followed is a matter for further discussion. In recent decades, Albanians have benefited from cooperation with the US and the EU in many areas. For example, NATO played a major role not only in the liberation but also in the security of Kosovo and subsequently helped develop the Kosovo Security Forces, which are now becoming a real defense force. Through NATO, a security umbrella has been created that supports peace and stability in the region. In economic terms, Albania and Kosovo's trade relations with Western countries are growing. Foreign investment, especially from Western countries, is an important factor in the economic development of Albania and Kosovo. For example, EU-funded infrastructure projects and economic agreements with the US help strengthen the economies of both Albanian republics and raise the standard of living for the population. Finally, Albanians in the diaspora, especially in the USA, are also an influential factor in strengthening transatlantic ties. They not only contribute with remittances and investments, but also play an important role in increasing the political and diplomatic influence of Albanians in the international arena. Meanwhile, Albanians in Western Europe were the decisive factor for the changes that followed on February 14, 2021, opening the prospect of the liberation of the Republic from the oligarchy and its functionalization on the scale that today guarantees the sovereignty of the Republic in its territorial integrity. Overall, transatlantic developments offer opportunities for economic growth, improved governance, and strengthened security for Albanians, but they also require a continued commitment to meet democratic standards and pursue policies that harmonize with Western ones. Meanwhile, European efforts for this kind of 'strategic emancipation' from the US, unfortunately, neither in Tirana nor in Pristina seem to have been able to read it properly. Official Pristina has, in fact, invested a lot in establishing good relations with Great Britain, as the bearer of Anglo-Saxon views and interests on the old continent. Consequently, in the expected geopolitical realignments even within the Western Hemisphere, the Anglo-Saxon grouping is likely to have a wider reach than can be judged in Paris or Berlin. [Let us recall on this occasion the AUKUS military alliance — Australia, United Kingdom, USA, signed on September 15, 2021, almost half a year before the Russian invasion for the complete occupation of Ukraine. Over time, Washington realized that this alliance 'would not be enough to contain China, because Beijing was not impressed, that is, it did not give any signs or make known any indication of its intention to submit to American global domination.'[8] After that, Washington focused on attracting its verified European and Asian partners. [Poland, the Baltic states and probably the Eastern Balkans]. Despite all these expected developments in transatlantic relations, the Albanian debate on the results of the US elections — as in the past — indicates the pronounced political deficit of our elite and those who claim to create opinion. The problem remains the forced display of views that place extreme expectations on American presidents. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Joe Biden have been elevated to Messiah-like figures. This dichotomous view does not reflect a mature society, but rather an overly prolonged and delayed adolescence. In this context of developments, the two Albanian republics together — political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo, as countries with little weight in the modern political scene and in international relations, must always pay attention to the power relations in motion in the world and focus on survival in the anarchic system of international relations. Moreover, they must take care of the interests of the Nation, our position and reputation in the world. Conclusion Now that Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office is almost certain, alarm bells about the expected negative impact on transatlantic relations have been ringing. But the biggest problem for Europe is now Ukraine. Given who will be in the White House in January 2025, the US will surely transfer the problem of financing the Ukraine war onto the shoulders of the EU, while it will fully return to the Middle East and confronting China, as the real center of its national interests.[9] Some of the ways in which his return could affect the EU’s political future: • US approach to NATO and Security Cooperation Trump has often shown skepticism towards NATO, calling for European member states to contribute more financially. If he focuses on reducing US commitment to NATO, this could increase pressure on the EU to build a stronger independent defence capability. The EU could try to advance its 'European defence' project to ensure more strategic independence. • Trade and Economic Policies Trump has supported protectionist policies and has sought bilateral agreements that favour the US, rather than multilateral ones. His return could bring new trade tensions between the US and the EU, which could worsen economic relations or lead to a reorientation of the EU towards other trading partners. • Climate and Energy Issues Trump has been skeptical of climate agreements, including the Paris Agreement, which the US withdrew from during his first term. If the EU sees a lack of cooperation from the US on climate issues, it could seek to deepen climate cooperation with other countries or increase its own investments in green technologies to maintain its role as a global leader on environmental issues. • Strengthening European Integration and Autonomy A Trump return could reinforce the narrative of a more independent and integrated EU. With less support from the US, there could be a push for more political and economic integration between member states. Political attitudes towards Russian and Chinese influence could also change, with the EU trying to avoid dependence on external powers. Overall, Trump’s possible return could prompt the EU to reconsider its foreign policy, increasing autonomy and defending its interests in a world where the US may be more focused on domestic policies and protectionist approaches. But due to the lack of leadership within the EU and the long-term flirtation with Putin’s Russian Federation, the EU has remained completely out of the spotlight of the competition of other world powers and their desire to free themselves from American dominance in the last three decades, since both Paris and Berlin believed that through that flirtation in the Washington-Moscow relationship, 'they would more easily gain the space to realize their national interests to the extent they considered necessary.[10]' Therefore, the future of the EU will depend largely on how it responds to internal and external challenges. Whether it moves towards a stronger political union or allows for more flexible models of cooperation will be crucial to ensuring stability, prosperity and influence at the global level. Consequently, the new European military path could be described as a strategic 'emancipation' of its own kind from the USA.

The 2004 EU Enlargement Was A Success Story Built On Deep Reform ...	Poland is one of the success stories of European economic convergence. The country, which in January takes the reins of the Council of the European Union (the decision-making institution representing the Union’s member states) is now the EU’s sixth largest economy. This convergence process was driven by the 2004 EU enlargement, which also welcomed the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovenia, and Slovakia into the Union, expanding the EU’s population by about 20 percent. Twenty years later, as new EU accession discussions are underway, it is worth looking at how much the earlier enlargement benefitted new members and the whole Union, and reflect on the economic returns of broadening the European single market. The current accession candidates, in different stages of the process, are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Türkiye. In October, the European Commission issued a new report with detailed assessments of the state of play and the progress toward EU accession made by each candidate. A new note by the Regional Economic Outlook for Europe shows that the 2004 EU enlargement brought substantial income gains. These gains were particularly large in the new member states: after 15 years GDP per person was on average more than 30 percent higher than it would have been without EU accession. The factors driving these gains in new members were threefold. First, the 2004 group benefitted from more comprehensive economic reforms prior to joining the EU than implemented in comparable other regions, including on trade, financial sector, and product market liberalization. Second, additional financing from foreign direct investment and EU cohesion funds helped boost the capital stock. Third, technology transfers and enhancements in educational attainment improved productivity. While all regions in new EU countries gained, some gained more than others. Those already better integrated into value chains with the existing member states increased GDP per person nearly 10 percentage points more than those less integrated pre-accession, irrespective of geographic distance. Regions with firms that had easier access to long term financing gained close to 15 percentage point more than others. Existing member states benefitted from EU enlargement too. By 2019, income per person was around 10 percent higher than it would have been in a scenario without enlargement. The main driver of these gains was the expansion of the EU’s single market, which allowed firms to expand production and reap efficiency gains, including through higher investment in the accession countries. While regions in Scandinavia, Germany, and Austria—already well integrated with new member states prior to accession—gained the most, many regions further away benefitted too. What does this mean for next wave of EU accession? A key lesson is that both accession candidate countries and existing EU members can benefit if they put in the work. This is no easy task. It would require strong pre-accession reforms, significant financing, political resolve, and possible institutional adaptation. Some factors of the 2004 successes may be harder to achieve today. For accession countries this puts a premium on those actions directly under their control, such as the reform effort to close business regulation and institutional gaps to the EU. From the existing members’ side, continuing to deepen the single market by removing remaining within-union trade barriers and advancing the capital market union to finance dynamic firms’ growth would further amplify the potential gains. These joint efforts could not only accelerate catch-up within Europe, but also help narrow Europe’s persistently large income gap with the US.

How Javier Milei Explains His Economic Philosophy – OpEd	By Patrick Carroll Javier Milei has garnered significant global attention over the past year, and it’s not hard to see why. The iconoclastic president of Argentina has been making considerable changes to his country’s government, and as an outspoken libertarian he has been introducing many to the freedom philosophy for the first time. In recent weeks, there have even been calls to use Milei’s approach as a model for Trump’s second term. But what exactly is Milei’s approach, and how has it been going? In a recent interview with Lex Fridman, Milei explained his economic and political philosophy and provided an update on Argentina’s situation. Three parts of the interview in particular stood out. 1) How Milei Discovered Austrian Economics In the first part of the interview, Milei explained how he discovered Austrian economics and how that radically changed his thinking about economic theory. The discovery happened around 2014, at which point he had been an economics professor in Argentina for 20 years: I remember that one of the people who worked on my team suggested I read an article by Murray Newton Rothbard called Monopoly and Competition. [The article was Chapter 10 of Man, Economy, and State, which had been excerpted as a stand-alone piece.] I remember reading it like it was today, and after reading it carefully, I said, 'Everything I’ve taught about market structure in the last 20 years in courses on microeconomics is wrong.' This caused a very strong internal commotion in me. So I called this person who used to work with me, and they recommended a place to buy Austrian School of Economics books, and I remember I bought at least 20 or 30 books, which I went to pick up one Saturday afternoon. And when I visited the bookstore, I was fascinated by all the stuff they had there. …I started to read very intensively, and I remember, for example, the experience of reading Human Action by Mises, and this was a book that I didn’t know about. And I remember that on the following weekend, I started to read this book right from the first page, and I didn’t stop until I finished it, and that was a true revolution in my head. And having the chance to read Austrian authors like Rothbard, Mises, Hayek, Hoppe, and Jesús Huerta de Soto, or others like Juan Ramón Rallo, Philipp Bagus, and Walter Block, for example. This is a fascinating story that highlights the power of Austrian economics. It is one thing when an economic school of thought becomes popular among lay readers. But when an accomplished economist does a complete about-face upon discovering a new economic philosophy, maybe that’s a philosophy worth taking seriously! And what, exactly, is Austrian economics? It’s hard to boil it down, but it’s essentially a system of economic laws that—in the Misesian tradition at least—are grounded in praxeology, the science of human action. Austrians take a radically different approach to basic economic theory, emphasizing human choice, subjective value, and the dynamic nature of the market. Though Austrian economics, like any positive science, is technically value-free, the Austrian view of the economy tends to paint all government intervention in the free market as causing problems rather than solving them. Thus, those who believe the Austrian school is correct are often staunch advocates of laissez-faire policies. Milei’s reference to Human Action, Mises’s magnum opus published in 1949, is especially heartwarming because of the special role that FEE played in making that book possible. Here’s what Larry Reed, FEE’s president emeritus, wrote about that story in 2016: Mises occupies a special place in the history of the organization I lead, the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). Human Action itself was published only when our founder Leonard E. Read agreed to buy nearly the entire first print run and distribute it. This is what kicked off the book to become a big seller for many decades. Suffice it to say, it is tremendously encouraging to see a figure like Milei introducing a new generation of thinkers to the Austrian tradition. 2) Economic Freedom and the Virtuous Cycle Later in the interview, Milei emphasized that Argentina’s plan for achieving economic prosperity is all about leaning into economic freedom: To have a sense of magnitude, the reforms that we already have made with the executive order 7023, and with the bases law, we have actually jumped 90 places in terms of economic freedom. What this means is that today, Argentina has institutions similar to those of Germany, France, Italy, and we obviously want this to continue. When Milei talks about jumping 90 places, he’s referring to global indexes of economic freedom, such as the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World report. The EFW index examines a country’s policies to see how much they are conducive to economic freedom, that is, capitalism. Each country is given an overall score based on five key areas: size of government, legal system and property rights, sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation. Countries are then ranked according to their score, with the highest-scoring countries (those having the most economic freedom) at the top. Jumping 90 places would mean jumping from, say, the 140th most economically free country to the 50th. What is significant about these indexes is that they consistently find that economic freedom is strongly correlated with positive outcomes, such as income per capita, life expectancy, life satisfaction, and environmental stewardship. Put plainly, countries that are more capitalist tend to be wealthier, healthier, and overall better places to live than countries where the government plays a larger role in the economy. After discussing why he is optimistic about Argentina’s prospects for economic growth, Milei made this interesting comment: Therefore, if during the worst moment our image didn’t suffer and we stayed strong in our ideas, now that everything is working much better, why should we change? On the contrary, we are ready to redouble the bet. Though Milei doesn’t quite lay it out this way, the overall plan seems to be creating a positive feedback loop that becomes a virtuous cycle. By establishing a bit more economic freedom, Argentina’s economy can recover and grow. This will bring Milei and his ideas more popularity, which will eventually translate into better electoral outcomes for Milei’s camp. Then, having more power, they can enact even more pro-freedom reforms, which will lead to a better economy, which will lead to more support, which will lead to even more freedom, and so on. And then, Argentina could become a beacon for the world, a shining city on a hill, an example of what a country can accomplish with free markets. And then it will be undeniable to everyone in the world that our ideas work, and it will only be a matter of time before the rest of the world follows suit. Is that a pipe dream? Perhaps. Then again, it could also be an accurate description of the next 10–30 years of world history. And wouldn’t that be something! The hardest part, of course, is getting the feedback loop started. What we need at the outset is the thing Leonard Read continuously stressed: a faith in freedom. Fortunately, what Milei seems to be saying is that we might already be past the hardest part. The Argentine people have put their faith in freedom, and the first signs of economic momentum, he says, are already showing. Time will tell if this proves to be true, but surely it’s a good sign. 3) The Most Wonderful Thing about Capitalism In one of the final sections of the interview, Milei explains why he thinks the market works so well as a guide for humanity: One must first understand what the market is. Simply put, the market is a process of voluntary exchange, where individuals cooperate through the transfer of property rights, in which private property is upheld. This is the system that drives the allocation of resources. In essence, socialism—and this is what Mises condemns in his book Socialism—shows that without private property, prices cease to exist and therefore resources are diverted. Why don’t you think it’s the same to make a road of asphalt or gold? Why not make it of gold? Because you have an understanding of economic calculation, you have an idea of prices in your mind. So, in this context, if there is no private property, there are no prices, and as a result, free market capitalism is the best mechanism ever developed by humankind for resource allocation. This also implies that markets must be free. Free from state intervention, because when the state intervenes, it creates interference. And markets need to allow free entry and exit, what we call competition. For Mises’s perspective on intervention in the market, see his books A Critique of Interventionismand Interventionism: An Economic Analysis. Milei continues: …And also, let’s talk about what pertains to the division of labor and social cooperation. The most wonderful thing about capitalism is that you can only be successful by serving others with better-quality goods at a better price. If you are successful in free market capitalism, you are a hero, you are a social benefactor, you are a prosperity machine. So the better you do, the better it is for society. This is very important. Milei’s comments here are spot on. In a free market, entrepreneurs earn profits by serving others. It is by solving problems, by developing inventions—in short, by creating value—that you get ahead in the free market. And this, fundamentally, is why markets work so well as a guide for humanity. They are a mechanism for systematically meeting human needs—the epitome of social cooperation. As Milton Friedman said, 'The essential notion of a capitalist society…is voluntary cooperation, voluntary exchange. The essential notion of a socialist society is fundamentally force.'

Why Europeans Should Take A Measured Approach Towards Trump In Af...	By Will Brown For Africa watchers, Donald Trump’s first stint in the White House was defined by three iconic episodes. The 45th president set the tone early with his comments about African countries being 'shitholes.' Then there was the utter confusion as a khaki-clad secretary of state Rex Tillerson rushed back from his first official trip to Africa, only to be given The Apprentice-style ‘you’re fired’ treatment on Twitter. Finally, Melania Trump finished up with a right-wing hook: a less-than-successful attempt to get the pith hat back in fashion on a visit to Kenya. European officials might be tempted to scream at a Brussels side-alley wall when contemplating Trump’s policies on Ukraine, Gaza, or tariffs. But on Africa, at least, they probably can breathe a measured sigh. Much like America’s policy towards China, how it engages with Africa seems to be one of the few holdouts in bipartisan politics. Unlike US-China policy, however, this is mainly because Africa is so low on Washington’s agenda that it often becomes subservient to other foreign policy objectives. Regardless, African and European officials should prepare for Trump to play a wild card regarding security. It is simply not clear what ‘America First’ will mean regarding boots on the ground in Africa and military assistance to the continent. Shifting conflict centres During the last Trump administration, the president made fighting Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria a mainstay of his foreign policy. He cultivated his image as the slayer of jihadi bosses, proclaiming in a 2019 speech – accompanied by many a gesticulation – that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 'died like a dog.' But on Africa, two paradoxical things happened. The US at once massively upped its drone strikes in Somalia to never-before seen levels, while Trump dramatically decreased the number of US troops on the continent from 5,000 to about 1,500. Now the centre of the jihadist conflict has shifted to West Africa’s Sahel, with one in every four deaths from terrorist violence last year occurring in Burkina Faso. But it somehow seems unlikely that, this time around, Trump will give the West African jihadist commanders as much attention as their Middle Eastern counterparts. A second administration might decide that the security crises on the continent are too bothersome for even the limited attention they get now. Indeed, if one thing is certain about the incoming administration’s US security policy on Africa, it is that Trump is likely to be even less willing than Joe Biden to expend any US political capital with the Gulf states – which hold the key to stopping the conflict in Sudan – and trying to push through a peace process in Sudan, the largest humanitarian crisis on earth. Likewise, whether a new administration would continue to counter Russia’s influence in Africa – which Biden’s administration seems to have been doing quietly and effectively – is another wild card hidden behind the misty Kremlinology of Trump’s personal relationship with president Vladimir Putin and the latter’s rabid aggression towards Ukraine. Strength through growth Analysts probably should not put too much credit in the Heritage Foundation’s 920-page ‘Mandate for Leadership’. Even so, it is worth considering the singular page devoted exclusively to what a new Trump policy towards the youngest and fastest-growing continent might look like. Some sentences on the growing geostrategic importance of sub-Saharan Africa to the US seem to be lifted from Biden’s 2022 Africa Strategy. '[Africa’s] explosive population growth, large reserves of industry-dependent minerals, proximity to key maritime shipping routes, and its collective diplomatic power ensure the continent’s global importance,' declares the opening paragraph, seemingly in mimicry. Then, amid the regular analytical banalities, the author recommends shifting from assistance to a growth model, countering 'malign' Chinese influence, and advocating an end to pushing policies 'birthed in the American culture wars' like abortion access and LGBT rights. The idea that Trump’s White House will massively boost autocratic tendencies across Africa seems a somewhat shallow take. Of course, it is bad news for those who champion the principles of an open society and it no doubt leaves US officials even less room to criticise the actions of autocrats. But if Americans are honest with themselves, both Democrats and Republicans have always been willing to support African strongmen who take a pro-US stance – going all the way back to Zaire’s president, Mobutu Sese Seko. Personnel dependencies A huge amount of US-Africa policy will depend on which officials Trump appoints, the tone he sets, and the issues which capture his administration’s imagination. South African-born Elon Musk and the MAGA’s movements foundations of Christian nationalism clearly have sway on Trump’s thinking, and it is conceivable that this could highlight surprising issues. The 47th president may suddenly become more vocal about the murder of white farmers in South Africa or Christians in Nigeria, for example. A couple of general predictions can be made with a degree of certainty. The US will almost certainly see its Africa policy through more of a Chinese lens. Under Biden, officials made a valiant effort to engage with Africa on its terms, not always through the prism of great power politics. But with Trump in the White House, wresting influence away from Beijing will be front and centre of the administration’s approach to Africa. This could mean, for example, US recognition of Somaliland as a hedge against Chinese gains in neighbouring Djibouti, where Beijing and Washington both have a permanent military presence. But it will still be an uphill slog for Washington. US trade with the continent sat at around $47.5 billion in 2023, compared to some $283.1 billion between China and Africa – while the number of US diplomats in Africa has recently fallen slightly, to around 2,000. The name of the game will be transactionalism and bilateralism, not development and multilateralism. Some African presidents, ever distrustful of Western support for civil society programmes, might even appreciate this clear-cut approach. Judging by campaign rhetoric, the United States Agency for International Development will increasingly be seen through an 'America first' narrative. Every dollar spent will be balanced against what its investment brings to the country’s companies, citizens, and interests. Furthermore, US support for family-planning programmes or LGBT rights in Africa will likely evaporate. America’s landmark African Growth and Opportunity Act, which was launched in 2000 to provide eligible countries with tariff-free access to certain products in the US market, does not seem to align with the MAGA talk on tariffs. Should this be on the chopping block in 2025, it would have disastrous effects for South Africa in particular. * While America’s future policy on Africa remains unclear, Trump’s re-election underscores the need for a coordinated and mutual European-African policy on the big strategic issues. Neither Europe nor Africa can rely on a rational, level-headed Washington anymore. But if the right tone is set, it could help usher in a renewed spirit of collaboration between the two continents. Nowhere is this clearer than on security. A vast stretch of land across from the southern flank of Europe, stretching from Mali to Sudan, is on fire. So far, European states have been woefully incapable of navigating the new fractured world of disinformation, mercenaries, and putschists, and of putting aside differences to become an effective force for peace and stability. Democratic leaders in Africa have not fared much better. Europeans need not be alarmist, however. These are tough challenges ahead, but they are not insurmountable. Trump’s re-election highlights the need to stay engaged in the Sahel wherever realistically possible, to throw their weight behind the peace process in Sudan, and overcome the petty divisions that often leave Europe less than the sum of its parts.

US Bond Yields Rise As Reserve Currency Status Wanes – Analysis	By Artis Shepherd With much consternation, capital markets participants are watching US treasury bond yields go up while Jerome Powell and the Fed continue to lower the Fed Funds Rate in an effort to spur another round of easy money. The Fed Funds rate is a short-term interest rate used for interbank borrowing. US treasury bonds are medium-long term securities that represent the sovereign debt of the US government, so the yield on those bonds represents the US government’s cost of borrowing. While there is no law that binds the two, lower rates from the Fed generally translate into lower treasury yields. Explanations for the divergence have been proffered, talking heads have opined, and conclusions abound with regard to the meaning behind the movement. Given the mixed signals, difficult questions related to the financial health of the US Treasury are being asked. Is the government’s profligate spending finally catching up with it? Isn’t more easy money from the Fed a reckless, inflationary gamble? Is the global reserve currency status a curse rather than a blessing? Regardless of what happens with US bond yields, these are important considerations for an American public ravaged by inflation due to government overspending and continual monetary molestation by the Federal Reserve. $2 Trillion Deficits The US is on track to run a $2 trillion deficit this fiscal year, which began in October. This will add to the existing national debt of $36 trillion, or 135 percent of GDP. Notwithstanding the goofy Department of Government Efficiency, all signs point to continued large deficits during the Trump administration. The recent action in US bond yields does not help this situation. By August of this year, futures markets had fully priced in a 25-50 basis point Fed rate cut in September, and were expecting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December. This expectation for the Fed Funds Rate initially carried over into treasury yields. At the beginning of August—as markets priced in 75-100bps of Fed rate cuts by year-end—10-year treasury yields reacted accordingly, dropping from 4.30 percent in late July (they had been 4.70 percent in April) to 3.65 percent in the middle of September. As of mid-November, that entire move had been erased, with yields back above 4.40 percent, roughly where they were prior to markets pricing in this year’s Fed rate cuts. At roughly $1 trillion annually, interest on the US debt carries an effective interest rate (interest expense divided by debt balance) of 3 percent. However, by mid-November, bond yields across the curve ranged from 4.25 percent to 4.75 percent, meaning interest expense is only going higher as old cheap bonds mature and are refinanced with new, more expensive bonds. Easy Money, Inflation, and Asset Bubbles In late 2020, the global inventory of bonds with negative yields reached an astounding $18.4 trillion. Let that sink in. $18.4 trillion worth of bonds where the lenders—rather than earning interest—were actually paying borrowers for the privilege of lending them money. The direct cause of this unfathomable distortion was central banks—the Federal Reserve foremost among them—playing fast and loose with monetary policy. Forcing interest rates down, creating money by the trillions, and fostering a reckless inflationary environment—centered on the capital markets and asset prices—has produced market signals that are unmistakably irrational. Faced with a much higher cost of living in light of excessive government spending and money creation by the Fed, average Americans have resorted to gambling in those same capital markets. American households and nonprofits now have nearly 42 percent of their financial assets in stocks, while the stocks themselves are at all-time highs. Into the teeth of this raging asset bubble comes the Fed with further rate cuts, the stand-alone effects of which are reflationary. And, all else equal, more inflation means higher yields on government bonds. It’s increasingly unlikely that investors will accept a yield that whittles down to zero after adjusting for inflation. Reserve Currency Status Sober and rational market observer Jim Grant recently analogized the US dollar’s reserve currency status as follows: [Reserve currency status] is like an affluent parent with a somewhat underachieving child saying [to that child], 'Here’s $20 million dollars, go out and drink yourself to death.' That, in a way, is the reserve currency privilege. Mr. Grant puts it well. There is no doubt that the US dollar’s reserve currency status has been abused, and that abuse was inevitable. Endless and expensive wars, combined with runaway spending for political programs, have effectively bankrupted the US Treasury. Honestly-underwritten, no investor would lend to a private entity with such a disdain for financial discipline and no sense of urgency to reverse course. Like the Pound Sterling before it, unhinged profligacy over an extended period of time is likely a precursor to the dollar’s loss of status and there are already compelling signs that global markets wish to decouple from the dollar, including a notable decline in foreign holdings of US treasuries relative to domestic holdings, the latter category including treasuries held by the Federal Reserve. This indicates that prospective foreign buyers of US sovereign debt are already wary of Uncle Sam’s rapidly-declining credit quality. Undoubtedly, the specter of the US losing reserve currency status should move treasury yields much more than a few dozen basis points, but bond markets often move at a glacial pace. While slow, such movements are just as unavoidable. Something That Can’t Last Forever Fair is foul, and the US reserve currency status is likely to be seen in hindsight as a curse rather than a blessing. The Fed’s ability to print money stems partially from the hubris of long-past geopolitical successes. Those successes, combined with a level of economic dominance, fostered an appetite from foreign markets for all things dollar-denominated. Increasingly, that no longer appears to be the case, but the domestic tendency to print and spend has not abated in the least. Those who continue to invest in US government bonds—despite the deranged fiscal recklessness of Congress and the improvisational monetary policy of the Fed—must do so with regard for the creditworthiness of the borrower and the soundness of its currency. As treasury yields go up, dependent markets—including stocks and housing—are likely to be impacted as well. Investors of all stripes would, therefore, do well to remember how currency regimes decline and asset bubbles pop—gradually, then all at once.

The Ulama Leadership Model Of The Islamic Party Of Malaysia (PAS)...	By Syaza Shukri and Muhammad Baihaqi Aminudin The Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) today stands at a crossroads as it seeks to firmly root itself in its traditional ulama leadership model. As PAS strives to uphold Islamic principles within Malaysia’s multi-ethnic social configuration, the time has come for a transformative dialogue about its future leadership. Can PAS evolve beyond its traditional boundaries to embrace a more inclusive vision that resonates with all Malaysians? Balancing its religious history with modern aspirations can unlock new possibilities for the party and the nation. PAS is an Islamist political party founded in 1951. Known for its conservative Islamic ideology, it has been a force of opposition even before Malaysia’s independence in 1957. It was in government for brief periods: 1973-77 and 2020-22. In PAS, kepimpinan ulama (ulama leadership) refers to a group of religious leaders holding key positions. As key players in shaping the party’s ideology and policies, the ulama (Islamic scholars) have been partly responsible for maintaining the party’s strong grassroots organisation. Since the resignation of the party’s fourth president Mohd Asri Haji Muda in the 1982 Muktamar (PAS’ Annual General Meeting), the leadership of PAS has been passed to the ulama faction. It then re-directed the party’s ideology and approach. The movement was led by Yusof Rawa, alongside other young leaders of the ulama cadre, including Nik Aziz Nik Mat, Abdul Hadi Awang and Fadzil Noor. Despite PAS having been founded and led by religious scholars who wanted to distinguish itself from UMNO via its Islamist ideology,[1] the kepimpinan ulamawas further popularised following the Iranian Revolution in 1979. In September 2024, PAS held its 70th Muktamar in Temerloh (Pahang). Party president Abdul Hadi Awang, in his keynote address, emphasised the continued relevance of Islamic governance under the guidance of the Majlis Syura Ulama in navigating Malaysia’s challenging political landscape under the Madani government. In accordance with its tradition, the Muktamar highlights the Ulama Council’s role in shaping PAS’ policy and ensuring that PAS remains grounded in Islamic principles while expanding its influence in the Malay heartland. Overall, the Muktamar reaffirmed the de facto central role of the ulama leadership in guiding the party’s direction. However, can the party’s leadership of the ulama push it forward to garner support from non-Malays? Undoubtedly, the ulama leadership in PAS has been a dominant force in Malaysian politics for over 40 years. On the one hand, the party currently collaborates with Malay-based party Bersatu and multiracial ones such as Gerakan under the Perikatan Nasional (PN) banner. On the other hand, PAS, on its own accord, maintains its Islamist identity, even more so after the 14th General Election (GE14).[2] After Pakatan Harapan (PH) won in 2018, PAS, alongside UMNO, adopted Islamist populism in which the supposed threat of civilisational 'others', particularly Chinese citizens, and necessitated a united Malay-Muslim front.[3] However, in 2023, during the 69th Muktamar, Hadi Awang admitted that one of the party’s weaknesses is its difficulty in garnering non-Muslim support.[4] In the 2024 Muktamar, PAS delegates voted to allow non-Muslims to become associate members of the party in its efforts to reform its image as an 'extreme' party in order to increase its support base.[5] The bigger elephant in the room is whether the PAS ulama leadership model would limit the success of this innovation. To be sure, under new political circumstances, it needs to reassess if the current leadership style is ideal. Malaysia is witnessing what is perhaps considered the 'Second Islamisation Race', whereby PAS is challenged by the Anwar Ibrahim unity government’s interpretation of Islam within the Madani framework.[6] Although Madani is introduced as a concept of civilisation (or civil society), its root in the Arabic term 'medina' (city) and its early discussion by Muslim thinkers such as Al-Farabi, Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Miskawayh suggests it has beginnings within Islamic history. In response to the Anwar Ibrahim administration’s more progressive views on Islam, PAS leadership can consider a new model to increase its relevance among the population. THE EVOLUTION OF ULAMA LEADERSHIP IN PAS Ulama are Islamic scholars who have received religious education. They are traditionally experts in Islamic theology, law (sharia), and jurisprudence (fiqh), playing a crucial role in shaping Muslim politics and influencing social discourse. For the purposes of this paper, however, we investigate the definition of ulama as perceived by PAS’ leadership which subsequently transformed the party into a conservative, oppositional, and sometimes revolutionary organisation.[7] The era of ulama leadership began after the 1982 Muktamar held in the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Kuala Lumpur. PAS witnessed the third formulation of the party’s ideology, after its experimentation with internationalism and left-wing ideologies during the Burhanuddin Al-Helmy presidency, and the Malay-Muslim ethnonationalism of the Asri years.[8] The ulama era marks the growing complexities of these three strains (ulama, internationalism, nationalism), especially when entering Malaysian politics in the 1980s and 1990s to oppose UMNO, a dominant, conservative Malay-nationalist party. By Malaysian standards, an ulama can be anyone with a background in Islamic studies, sometimes leading to the phenomenon of 'false ulama'.[9] Currently, the President and Deputy President of PAS, Abdul Hadi Awang and Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man, have qualifications in Islamic studies and political science (leadership), and party members consider them to be religious clerics.[10] From the 1990s and until recently, PAS had always chosen an ulama to be First Minister (Menteri Besar) in states it has governed.[11] Eight years after the ulama leadership began in 1982, Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, an ulama who received training in Egypt and India, was appointed Menteri Besar of Kelantan. Hadi Awang, another ulama trained in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, was selected by PAS as Menteri Besar of Terengganu after the party defeated Barisan Nasional (BN) in 1999. However, after PAS took control of the Terengganu state administration in 2018, the custom of designating ulama as Menteri Besar was discontinued. Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar, an aeronautical engineer and university lecturer, became the party’s choice for the position. Samsuri had been Hadi Awang’s political secretary, thus his nomination might have more to do with his political experience than his education—or lack thereof—even though it seems to go against party practice. Since then, Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor’s rise to power in Kedah and national politics has continued to indicate a departure from the ulama-centric ideology. Known for his populist appeal and shoot-from-the-hip public statements,[12] Sanusi does not have a background in Islamic studies. The party has yet to determine a different leadership model at the national level.[13] The most possible path forward may be ethnonationalist leadership, given PAS’ veer towards right-wing populism through its partnership with Bersatu. The strength of the ulama leadership lies in its resonance with a significant segment of the Malay populace. This has been proven partly when PAS won in many places inside its largely conservative and rural stronghold in the 15thgeneral election (GE15) in 2022.[14] This is due to Islam’s central role in Malaysian society and politics and an important factor in enhancing legitimacy and control for the Malay-Muslim population.[15] The popularity of this model underscores the validity of religiously grounded leadership.[16] A notable downside surfaces in the perception that the ulama leadership model may be ill-suited to the demands of the current political scene. As argued by Kuru,[17] the alliance between the ulama and the state may lead to authoritarianism as the ulama may no longer play its role effectively as a check on the government. As a result, broader aspirations for reform in the government’s administration would be harder to materialise. The risk is that PAS could find itself alienated within the national reform struggle, particularly among Malaysians who seek a more progressive and liberal political approach. RESEARCH DESIGN This paper is based on qualitative research with a specific focus on expert interviews. This approach has been chosen for its capacity to delve deeply into the experiences, perspectives, and interpretations surrounding the impact and implications of ulama leadership within PAS. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with Ahmad Ubaidillah (Head, Gombak PAS Youth Wing) and Afnan Hamimi (National PAS Youth Chief and Member of Parliament for Alor Setar), whose direct involvement with the party provided a unique lens into the motivations and challenges of this model. Additionally, written interviews were conducted with Dr Mohd Zuhdi Marzuki (Former PAS Research Center Director) and Dr Mahfodz Mohamed (Former Head of the Central PAS Ulama Council). All the interviews were conducted in June 2024. These interviewees represent diverse positions in PAS, including the ulama and non-ulama leaders, with Dr Mohd Zuhdi, Afnan, and Dr Mahfodz being the most prominent. The semi-structured nature of the interview guide ensures a balance between flexibility and coverage of essential themes related to ulama leadership. THE FUTURE OF THE ULAMA LEADERSHIP MODEL Within PAS, there is a steadfast belief in the importance of ulama leadership. The interviewees present this model as crucial to the maintaining of PAS’s core values and to ensuring that its decisions are grounded in Islamic principles. The preference for ulama leadership stems from a commitment to align PAS to the teachings and requirements of the Shariah, or Islamic laws. Dr Mohd Zuhdi Marzuki emphasises the need to defend the ulama leadership model. He points to a period from 2008 to 2015, when he claims that the party’s direction risked being hijacked by external influences within the Pakatan Rakyat coalition. During that period, tension was high between PAS and DAP, especially about the implementation of hudud and the establishment of an Islamic state. It was also high within PAS itself between the so-called ulama and professional factions. Further reinforcing Dr Mohd Zuhdi’s perspective is Afnan Hamimi, who asserts that the ulama leadership is irreplaceable. He states, 'Ulama leadership cannot be replaced with another model because the highest reference in PAS is Al-Quran, Sunnah, Ijma’, and Qiyas.'[18] This highlights the belief that any alternative leadership model could not adequately uphold the party’s religious obligations, and preserve the integrity of its decisions. These views underscore a broader sentiment within PAS that the ulama are uniquely equipped to ensure that the party’s actions and policies remain faithful to Islamic teachings. Based on the party’s constitution, 'Members of the Ulama Council are teachers or/and graduates of any field of Islamic studies from any Higher Education Institution or any person who has mastered Islamic studies who has become a member of PAS.'[19] The ulama’s understanding of religious texts and principles are supposed to position them as the ideal leaders to navigate complex political landscapes while staying true to PAS’ mission. However, the belief in ulama leadership within PAS is not universally held, and there are interpretations that suggest a more flexible approach. The notion that the ulama leadership is necessary is challenged by those who emphasise the guidance of the Majlis Syura rather than specific leadership roles within PAS. As Ahmad Ubaidillah mentioned, '[I]nstitutionally, ulama leadership means the struggle and movement of PAS guided by the Majlis Syura'.[20] This definition highlights that the essence of ulama leadership is not in holding power directly but in providing vital religious and legal oversight. This overview by the Majlis Syura ensures that the decisions and actions of PAS align with Islamic principles, but does not necessitate that an Ulama occupies the presidency or other leadership roles. This view supports a model where the guidance of ulama in legal and religious affairs ensures continuity, regardless of who holds specific titles. This stand had been previously argued by the so-called 'Erdogan' camp in PAS led by Mohamad Sabu. But after his faction was defeated in the 2015 party polls, there has been no clear direction on whether the party is ready to accept this interpretation of leadership, and if so to what extent. Further expanding this idea, Ahmad Ubaidillah noted that, '[W]hether an ulama needs to be a leader or president is flexible and can change'.[21] This flexibility allows professionals or other qualified individuals to lead PAS without losing the party’s core Islamic principles. Such flexibility might bring fresh perspectives and adaptability to PAS’s political strategies while preserving the party’s integrity governed by the Majlis Syura. Although Ahmad Ubaidillah may not be as nationally prominent as the other interviewees, he does hold a position in the party’s branch and his views should not be dismissed. He also observed that the tradition of having an ulama as president is not a constitutional requirement. 'It is merely a tradition, not a strict rule in the constitution that says only ulama can be president.'[22] This assertion highlights the openness within the party’s framework for different leadership models that still respect and uphold the guidance function of the ulama, as already championed by the progressive faction before they left PAS and formed Parti Amanah Negara. But according to Dr Mahfodz Mohamed, 'As long as there is no proposal to revoke it, the ulama leadership will remain.'[23] The prevailing sentiment among interviewees is that the current ulama leadership model is the most appropriate for PAS. There is also a recognition that any significant change to this model would require a substantial shift in the mindset of PAS supporters. As further clarified by Dr Mahfodz Mohamed, '[T]here have been efforts to replace the ulama leadership model with another policy, such as during the leadership election in 2015… There were contests for positions from the president downwards, but they all failed in the election. Therefore, the ulama leadership model has remained in place until today.'[24] Yet, as PAS’ long history has shown, the party ebbs and flows according to the political landscape of Malaysia. If enough people within and outside the party demand change, PAS may find it necessary to reconsider its leadership model. CONCLUSION At its core, Islam as a religion anchors itself in the teachings of the Quran and Hadith, which prioritise respect, tolerance, and peace—values that can foster unity and harmony within Malaysia’s multicultural society. Under the guidance of elected representatives committed to inclusivist Islamic values, these principles have the potential to underpin governance that is both compassionate and just. For example, Nik Aziz, the revered spiritual leader of PAS from 1991 until 2015, exemplified a blend of inclusivist ulama leadership. Emphasising Islamic principles, figures like Nik Aziz and Fadzil Noor keenly fostered inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony via cooperation with the DAP,[25] understanding that national unity depends on respect for Malaysia’s multicultural fabric. Their commitment to inclusivity ensured that PAS remained relevant and appealing across diverse communities, thus fostering acceptance of the party by a wider population segment. Preserving religious values while embracing diversity could coexist, paving the way for harmony that benefits both the party and the nation. From the interviews, it appears that the core principles of ulama leadership are expected to continue guiding PAS. The party’s future will likely involve a continuous balancing between maintaining its religious foundations and adapting to the changing political environment. Understanding this dynamic will be crucial for the future of Malaysia, given PAS’s current position as the single party with the largest number of seats in Parliament. Failing to evolve, the party will stay stagnant with just the support of conservative Malay-Muslims in Malaysia. The by-elections held in 2024 exemplify this, when Perikatan Nasional lost three of the four state by-elections. In Nenggiri and Mahkota, Barisan Nasional even increased its majority by 16.08% and 43.56%, respectively, at the expense of the Perikatan Nasional candidates. Since Perikatan Nasional and Barisan Nasional (specifically UMNO) compete for the same pool of Malay-Muslim voters, growing support for UMNO is not a good sign for PAS. Although these results cannot be generalised, there is a sense that Perikatan Nasional has reached its zenith in terms of support from its traditional base. Unless PAS decides to make changes swiftly, including in its leadership model, there is little likelihood of it taking over Putrajaya, except with the help of partners within and outside of Perikatan Nasional such as Bersatu, Gerakan, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS). But for PAS to convince the others to join a government coalition, the party needs to show willingness to compromise—as it did before under Pakatan Rakyat—which might be difficult to achieve with a narrow and populist interpretation of Islamic values. While PAS had worked with these parties to form the federal government from 2020 until 2022, it might be more challenging now that GRS, and especially GPS, have found that they can work effectively with Pakatan Harapan under the leadership of Anwar Ibrahim. Therefore, for PAS to envision a future as the main party leading Malaysia, it needs to have an honest review of its strategy to be more attractive to both non-Muslims and Muslims who may not share the view of having an ulama heading the party or the country. This would be in line with calls by the party to open its membership to non-Muslims. Dissenting voices within PAS must make greater effort to convince the current leadership to accept different views; that is how the party can stay united and avoid another splinter group being formed.

Trump Puts Taiwan On The Tightrope – Analysis	By Haruka Satake Donald Trump’s 2024 US presidential election victory marks the beginning of a critical phase for Taiwan. As US–China tensions continue to escalate, Taiwan’s strategic importance is more pronounced than ever. With Trump’s foreign policy approach largely transactional and focused on financial leverage, Taiwan will need to navigate a shifting dynamic that could reshape its relationship with both the United States and China. Despite already spending around 2.5 per cent of its GDP on defence — comparable to NATO members like the United Kingdom at 2.5 per cent and France at approximately 2 per cent — Trump has criticised Taiwan’s defence spending as insufficient given the growing threat from China. During his first term, Trump pushed Taipei to strengthen its defence capabilities and expanded arms sales to Taiwan, including advanced fighter jets and missile systems. In 2021 alone, the United States approved a US$750 million arms sale to Taiwan, signalling continued defence support. A second Trump presidency could bring greater pressure on Taiwan to increase defence spending or purchase even more advanced military systems from the United States. Trump’s transactional approach would likely mean that Taiwan’s support and willingness to invest more in its defence will be critical to maintaining strong US–Taiwan relations. Taiwan’s multibillion dollar purchase of US arms can be seen as a strategic partnership as well as a financial transaction that benefits the US defence industry. Trump’s accusations of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry ‘stealing’ US jobs and his calls for Taipei to further hike military spending suggests that US support may come at a higher price this time. Some analysts remain positive, arguing that Taiwan could align with Trump’s transactional worldview by using its financial capabilities to increase US diplomatic support. But others have warned that Trump’s election signals a dangerous future for Taiwan, including concerns that Trump’s dismissive remarks about Taiwan may reflect his true stance. Plus, key US officials who supported Taiwan have left Trump’s administration. These warnings underscore the increasing uncertainty surrounding Taiwan’s position under a second Trump presidency. Proactive measures are crucial to navigating these challenges. Taiwan must prepare for potential shifts in Trump’s policies, which could significantly impact industries across the region. Companies should anticipate scenarios where tariffs rise by up to 10 per cent and estimate the corresponding costs to their operations. Given these measures will likely be shaped through negotiations with trade partners, it is essential for industries to develop flexible contingency plans to mitigate potential disruptions effectively. Taiwan could also prioritise relationships with key pro-Taiwan figures within the Trump administration, such as incoming secretary of state Marco Rubio and national security advisor Michael Waltz, who have supported Taiwan’s interests and could play a crucial role in shaping US policy towards Taiwan. Trump’s economic policies, particularly his stance towards China, will also play a pivotal role in shaping future US–Taiwan relations. After Trump’s victory, the Taiwanese government expressed its desire for the United States to continue its current policy of deterring China while maintaining friendly relations with Taiwan. But if Trump reduces US trade dependence on China through tariffs, the United States could increase pressure on Taiwan to counter China militarily and economically. If this were to happen, Taiwan would be forced to strengthen its economic ties with the United States and lessen its dependence on China. Taiwan’s central bank warned such a change in US economic policy may directly impact the momentum of Taiwan’s export growth and deter domestic investment, which could have a negative impact on economic growth. Taiwan’s dominance in the semiconductor industry could also be a source of friction with Trump. Taiwan should carefully navigate this delicate balance between the United States and China and avoid a situation where it is forced to take sides economically or politically in a way that harms its long-term stability. This economic unpredictability ties directly into Trump’s broader diplomatic approach, complicating other countries’ ability to anticipate his policy moves. While his confrontational stance on China — particularly regarding trade and security — has been clear, his overall strategy has been difficult to predict. Already navigating a complex geopolitical environment, Taiwan should prepare for potential volatility in US economic and diplomatic actions. The uncertainty surrounding Trump’s decision-making forces Taiwan to adapt continually to changing US policies in both economic and security spheres. Taiwan should push for policies that strengthen its economic resilience by diversifying trade relationships, reducing reliance on the United States and China and ensuring strong defence capabilities to counter potential threats. Doing so would help Taiwan better navigate US foreign policy volatility while maintaining its economic stability and sovereignty. The second Trump administration will profoundly affect Taiwan and the region. Trump’s transactional foreign policy will likely demand increased financial contributions in military purchases, pressuring Taiwan to invest more in its own defence while supporting the US defence industry. Taiwan must navigate these pressures carefully, balancing economic stability with military deterrence within the complex US–China–Taiwan triangle.

Power Play At APEC – OpEd	By Ambassador Gurjit Singh The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, held from 13-15 November, returned to Peru after eight years. Given that APEC has 21 member economies, Peru has hosted the summit frequently: in 2008, 2016 and now in 2024. The theme was ‘Empower. Include. Grow.’ It’s an essential call for a region with stalled economic integration, growing protectionism, geo-political tensions and restricted growth prospects. The APEC Leaders endorsed the consensus Machu Picchu Declaration,[1] pursuing efforts to achieve robust economic growth. The Lima Roadmap to Promote the Transition to the Formal and Global Economies (2025-2040) and Ichma Statement on A New Look at the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific Agenda, were adopted alongside. The Declaration had a companion Chair’s Statement, manifesting discussion on the Ukraine and other crises. Just Energy Transition Initiative, Achieving Food Security Through Sustainable Agri-food Systems, Agricultural Biotechnology, Combatting Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and illegal logging and facilitation of remanufactured consumer electronic goods, were among the ideas agreed upon. Will this word salad of resolutions have meaningful implementation or impact? It’s not clear it will. However, some dimensions of the meeting deserve attention. First, with this summit, Peru has brought itself into the international limelight. Contiguity and advance planning with Brazil, which hosted the G20 summit on November 18-19 immediately following APEC, meant that nine G20 leaders could attend both. With the number of global summits growing, their proximity to each other in location and dates helps maximize attendance. Second, Peru attracted many leaders. Most eyes were on Xi Jinping of China, who came ready to cut the ribbon on his $3.6 billion investment in the Chancay Port, on the Pacific coast of Peru. This is one of China’s largest investments in Latin America and is causing concern in the U.S., which does not like seeing China getting too deep in the Pacific. But Peru then facilitated China by announcing that Beijing would host the 2026 APEC summit. Unlike the G20, APEC Summits hosts aren’t selected by rotation but rather, countries seek a convenient year. China last hosted in 2014, and, it seems, has bypassed processes thanks to Peru, to be 2026’s APEC president. For its part, this seems to be Peru’s way of signalling its growing proximity to Beijing. The two other APEC presidents, however, are fixed and selected according to APEC norms: Korea will host the Summit in 2025 and Vietnam in 2027. China certainly pressed home its colligation and influence over Peru. It demanded restricted Taiwanese representation unless it was by an individual they could approve of. Taiwan, one of the 21 member economies of APEC, has, like its peers, normally selected its own special envoy. This time, it was former Vice President Chen Chien-jen, known as a public health expert. Alas, he fell afoul of an assertive Beijing which saw him as too close to the ruling party’s sovereign agenda. Ultimately, Taiwan was represented by senior presidential adviser Lin Hsin-i.[2] The U.S. President participated, but Joe Biden is now at the end of his tenure[3], and the other leaders were keen to understand the next administration led by Donald Trump. That will take time for APEC economies to understand. Russia was represented by Deputy PM Alexey Overchuk, as President Vladimir Putin did not travel to Brazil for the G20 either.[4] There were many new faces at the summit, thanks to the multiple elections which took place around the world in 2024. Among the APEC members, there were new leaders from Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand. APEC has had its share of churn over the last year. An APEC membership expansion moratorium has been in place since 1998. Initially set till 2008, this was extended indefinitely in 2010. Hence, unlike SCO and BRICS which have expanded over the last two years, APEC is not discussing new members, although India, Cambodia, Colombia, Macau, (China), Costa Rica, Mongolia, Pakistan, Panama, Sri Lanka, and Ecuador have evinced interest from time to time.[5] An equally important event that was held alongside the summit and its preceding ministerial segment was the APEC CEO Forum Expectedly, it had a large Chinese contingent, displaying openly their interest in the Latin America region. The discussions at the CEO Summit, however, were all about the return of Trump, and this impacted the discourse on how trade relations would develop in the months ahead. Xi Jinping warned against protectionism, since he is evidently preparing for a further tariff war by the U.S. Artificial Intelligence, now ubiquitous in all global discussions, was a recurring theme during the CEO Summit, as it is expected to alter the nature of many industries and requires adjustment to ensure that labour markets are not negatively impacted. The number of Chinese businessmen dealing with AI who attended seeking opportunities understand well how other economies are dealing with it; their knowledge was impressive. Financial inclusion was prioritized, particularly by those from emerging markets, like Vietnam. APEC’s significance now lies in its comprehensive strategy for regional recovery and resilience across sectors. In the wake of post-pandemic problems, APEC has enhanced its economic coordination, and its members have implemented fiscal assistance ranging from 1% to 20% of their GDP to stabilize domestic health systems and facilitate the uninterrupted supply of necessary products. This collaborative structure is perceived to foster a layer of enduring economic recovery. Digital transformation is integral to APEC’s agenda, particularly within creative sectors that generate $2.2 trillion globally. APEC advocates digital competencies and infrastructure to empower smaller countries, positioning creative sectors as catalysts for innovation and inclusive development. APEC’s activities on climate resilience and food security highlight its current significance – given that 22% of the South American continent is forest[6], and it accounts for a quarter of global agricultural and fisheries exports.[7] APEC plans to issue climate bonds and regional carbon networks,[8] and has introduced new food security measures to safeguard key supply lines during unforeseen global disruptions.[9] Collectively, these initiatives provide APEC an essential forum for addressing pressing economic, social and environmental issues and remain relevant.[10] [11] Can APEC be that model of collaborative governance and promote long-term prosperity and balanced development in the region? The follow-up to the Peru resolutions over the next year will show whether it can. Meanwhile, distractions abound, most particularly the new rivalry between China and the U.S. before APEC meets again in Korea in 2025.

Cryptocurrency Making Inroads In Central Asia And Caucasus	(Eurasianet) -- Cryptocurrency ownership is gaining popularity across Central Asia and the Caucasus, according to a report prepared by a group of financial services companies. Uzbekistan has the highest adoption rate for crypto assets in the regions and ranks 33rd globally. The Russian-language report, titled Digital Assets in Central Asia and the Caucasus, shows that almost 1.5 percent of Uzbekistan’s population, or roughly 512,000 individuals, owns cryptocurrency. The 15 licensed cryptocurrency exchanges and outlets operating in Uzbekistan handled over $1 billion worth of transactions in 2024, the report adds. Just two years ago, Uzbekistan ranked 87th in global crypto adoption. In 2023, the country shot up to 25th in the world rankings before falling back to 33rd this year. Despite slipping, Uzbekistan still outpaces its Central Asian neighbors when it comes to crypto asset adoption. Kazakhstan ranked 57th in the world and Kyrgyzstan 76th, according to the report. Tajikistan and Turkmenistan were not ranked. Kazakhstan’s ranking might be much higher, if not for a far-reaching government regulatory initiative covering cryptocurrency production and usage. No official data on crypto assets is available for Kazakhstan, but some independent estimates indicate 8 percent of the population may hold cryptocurrency. In 2021, Kazakhstan emerged as a leading center for cryptocurrency mining following a crackdown in China on the practice, which requires immense amounts of electricity. By the fall of that year, Kazakhstan’s global Bitcoin hashrate, an indicator of the amount of power being used to produce cryptocurrency, was over 27 percent. During the same period, the country experienced power outages as the electricity grid buckled under the rising demand. The Kazakh government in following years introduced measures to hinder crypto mining, including the introduction of steep tariffs for intensive power usage. As a result, the country’s Bitcoin hashrate fell to 4 percent in May 2023. The number of mining operations in Kazakhstan likewise plummeted between 2021 and mid-2023, going from 330 to 26. But over the past 15 months, the number of mining outfits have risen to 51, the report states. At the same time the government took steps to hinder mining, it introduced regulatory changes to enable officials to better monitor crypto transactions. In late 2023, Kazakhstan also introduced a digital currency under Central Bank supervision that is designed to compete with cryptocurrencies. In the Caucasus, Georgia has the highest global ranking in crypto asset adoption, coming in at 54th. That position, however, is 17 spots lower than Tbilisi’s ranking in 2022. Armenia was 77th and Azerbaijan came in at 92nd, according to the report, which was sponsored by a variety of financial services entities, including Mastercard, KPMG and the National Payment Corporation of Kazakhstan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek8QUuQCeZiyG	2024-12-03T16:32:55-08:00	
Libya Energy Profile: Despite Large Oil Reserves, Political Confl...	Libya was the seventh-largest crude oil producer in OPEC and the third-largest total petroleum liquids producer in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria, in 2023.1 At the beginning of 2024, Libya held 3% of the world's proved oil reserves and 41% of Africa’s proved oil reserves.2 Despite Libya’s large oil reserves, political conflicts and militia attacks on hydrocarbon infrastructure have limited investments in the country’s oil and natural gas sectors. These challenges have also constrained exploration and development of its reserves since 2011. Although Libya is a member of OPEC, it is exempt from the production cuts under the OPEC+ agreement.3 Crude oil production is very volatile and is frequently shut in because of conflicts, labor disputes, budget constraints, ongoing maintenance issues, and insufficient storage capacity. Political instability that began with Libya’s civil war in 2011 continues to pose risks for the energy sector.4 The two government factions, the Government of National Accord (GNA) in the western region and the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the eastern region, and other local militias used oil exports as leverage, and their fighting caused massive disruptions to Libya’s oil production between 2014 and 2020. The GNA and the LNA signed a ceasefire agreement in October 2020 and formed an interim unity government, the Government of National Unity (GNU), in March 2021.5,6 The GNU scheduled presidential and parliamentary elections for late December 2021. However, the various parties could not agree on election laws and candidates, leading to the GNU indefinitely postponing the elections. The United Nations has been working with factions in Libya for almost three years to reach an agreement on constitutional laws and procedures regarding the election process, but the political impasse has impeded elections moving forward.7 In March 2022, Libya’s parliament in the eastern region installed a new interim government and prime minister, Fathi Bashagha, in Tripoli, but the previous prime minister of the GNU, Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, did not step down, resulting in the continuation of a divided government. Although Bashagha attempted to replace al-Dbeibah in Tripoli in July 2022, he was unsuccessful.8 Al-Dbeibah and the eastern military leader Khalifa Haftar struck a deal in July 2022, which involved replacing the head of the national oil company, the eastern government no longer pushing for Bashagha to become the interim prime minister, and eastern factions ending a blockade on oil infrastructure.9 The most recent conflict, which began in 2024, involves a conflict between the eastern and western governments over leadership of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL). The GNU replaced the CBL’s long-time governor, Sadiq al-Kabir, in August 2024 after he attempted to put more fiscal restrictions on spending by the GNU. In response, the eastern government imposed blockades on oil fields and eastern ports.10 However, the eastern government allowed a limited amount of oil cargoes to leave certain ports and oil production to go to refineries.11 The two governments negotiated an agreement that installed an interim governor of the CBL at the end of September 2024.12 Crude oil and natural gas export revenues are a significant part of Libya’s economy, accounting for an estimated 97% of Libya’s total government revenues and an estimated 93% of the country’s total value of exports in 2023.13 We estimate that Libya’s net oil export revenues totaled $30 billion in 2023, similar to 2022 totals. Although Libya’s oil exports rose in 2023, oil prices decreased from 2022.14 Fossil fuels met nearly all of Libya’s energy demand, with oil accounting for 57% and natural gas accouting for almost 43% in 2022. Rooftop solar projects met less than 1% of the remaining energy demand.15 Petroleum and other liquids At the beginning of 2024, Libya held Africa’s largest proved oil reserves, at 48 billion barrels, representing 41% of the continent’s total reserves. Libya ranked in the top 10 countries for global proved oil reserves.16 About 95% of Libya’s recoverable reserves are located in the onshore Sirte Basin in the northeast and Murzuq Basin in the southwest. These two basins also account for most of the country’s oil production capacity.17 Most of Libya remains unexplored for oil, and ongoing civil unrest has prevented a large-scale exploration program.18 Libya produces mostly high-quality light, sweet (low sulfur) crude oil grades, which can be processed into valuable petroleum products in simple refineries.19 After Libya’s crude oil production (excluding condensates) reached around 1.7 million barrels per day (b/d) prior to the start of the 2011 civil war, political dissention over the following decade caused a steep production decline and several major disruptions to production and exports. Libya’s production could return to pre-2011 averages if the various political factions could form a unified and stable government, attract foreign investment for exploration and development projects, and provide sufficient revenue to strengthen the country’s aging oil infrastructure.20 Following the ceasefire agreement signed by the eastern and western governments in October 2020, Libya’s crude oil production recovered to more than 1.1 million b/d by 2021.21 In 2022, crude oil production again dipped, to below 700,000 b/d from May through July, because of a dispute, later resolved, between the two rival governments that resulted in blockades of eastern ports. Despite Libya experiencing stable oil production for nearly two years, crude oil production was severely disrupted in August 2024. The large Sharara oil field in the country’s southwestern region went offline in early August, except for its output that serves oil-fired electricity production and the Zawiya refinery on the western coast.22 Disputing the Spanish government over a charge made against one of General Haftar’s sons, the Haftar family decided to close the Sharara field, which is partially operated by Spanish oil company Repsol.23 The second disruption, primarily in the eastern oil fields, occurred in late August 2024 after the western government replaced the Central Bank of Libya’s leadership. The dispute led to the eastern government closing or reducing production from most of Libya’s oil fields and disrupting export flows from the eastern ports.24 Crude oil production fell to below 600,000 b/d by the end of August and during September 2024.25 After the two sides came to an agreement on leadership at the CBL and the national oil company (NOC) lifted the force majeure at Libya’s oil fields and ports, production began to rise in early October 2024.26 Libya’s natural gas fields produce condensates and natural gas plant liquids (NGPL) and contribute relatively small volumes to the country’s total petroleum and other liquids production. We estimate that condensate and NGPL production was less than 100,000 b/d in 2023.27 Libya’s NOC intends to bolster crude oil and condensate production to more than 1.5 million b/d by the end of 2024 and 2.0 million b/d by 2025.28To reach this target, the NOC’s plans include increasing oil production through developing new projects, rehabilitating fields that were damaged during the conflicts of the past decade, and increasing power supply to the fields. To increase its production and offset current declines from older fields, Libya needs to attract more foreign investment and technical capacity. The NOC and international companies announced several projects, most from the Waha oil concessions, over the past few years, although many of these projects have faced delays because of the complications from Libya’s political conflicts.29 Despite the numerous challenges to maintaining oil production, the NOC kept oil production stable in 2023 and through July 2024 by starting production from new wells or rehabilitating existing wells across the country.30 After declining to just below 200,000 b/d in 2020, Libya’s petroleum and other liquids consumption increased each year since then and reached 235,000 b/d in 2023.31 We estimate that the shares of gasoline (47%), diesel (32%), and fuel oil (8%) accounted for most of Libya’s petroleum consumption in 2022.32 Most of the domestically consumed crude oil is processed in Libya’s refineries, and less than 20,000 b/d of crude oil directly fuels power plants.33Libya has five refineries with a combined nameplate crude oil distillation capacity of 380,000 b/d.34 However, the country produced around 130,000 b/d of petroleum products, about one-third of total nameplate capacity.35 The low plant utilization is the result of damage that occurred to some facilities during the civil war and the slow progress made to rehabilitate all of the plants.36 Ras Lanuf, Libya’s largest refinery by nameplate capacity, was significantly damaged after the 2011 civil war and has been offline since 2013. A legal dispute over the damages between the joint venture (JV) owners, the NOC and Trasta (an Emirati-owned company) was finally settled in February 2022. The arbitration ruled that the NOC did not owe any damage compensation to Trasta and could buy Trasta’s 50% share in the JV. Although this agreement is a significant step toward bringing the Ras Lanuf refinery back online, negotiations regarding the sale of Trasta’s stake in the JV are ongoing, and the NOC would need to rehabilitate the refinery to bring it back into operation.37 The NOC is planning to build a 30,000-b/d refinery in southwestern Libya near the Sharara oil field. Despite the facility’s small size, it would be the first refinery to serve southern Libya. This region is far from the energy demand centers along the coast, and it relies on petroleum products transported a long distance by truck from the western coast. Construction has not begun, but the NOC estimates that the facility will be completed in about three years from the time that construction begins. The NOC signed an engineering contract with Honeywell International, Inc., in 2023. NOC subsidiary, Zallaf Company, reported in mid-2024 that the project is proceeding.38 Natural gas At the beginning of 2024, Libya had proved natural gas reserves of 53 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), the fifth largest in Africa behind Nigeria, Algeria, Mozambique, and Egypt.46 Non-associated gas, which accounted for more than 90% of Libya's natural gas production over the past decade, is from the offshore Bahr Essalam fields northwest of Tripoli and the onshore Wafa field in the western Ghadames Basin straddling Algeria.47 Most of Libya's natural gas associated with crude oil fields is in the onshore Sirte Basin in the eastern region. Libya’s dry natural gas production fell from 423 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in 2022 to 394 Bcf in 2023.48 Output has declined from a high in 2017 because the volatile security situation and unfavorable regulatory environment have deterred upstream investment by international oil companies. Also, associated gas fields have been offline for significant periods of time when the accompanying oil fields are shut in. Because the NOC expects production from major natural gas fields Bahr Essalam and Wafa to decline starting in 2025, Libya will face domestic natural gas shortages if it cannot secure foreign investment to develop its proposed projects. Libya plans to increase natural gas production by reducing flaring and developing new fields to help meet growing domestic demand and export obligations. However, Libya’s current political stalemate and budget constraints are major downside risks to reaching these goals. Oil and natural gas projects in Libya are typically delayed for several years because of security, regulatory, and financial challenges.49 The NOC plans to offset expected declines from mature fields and increase natural gas production from both offshore and onshore fields in western Libya. Italy’s Eni and Libya’s NOC are developing a major offshore project to tie back to the Mellitah natural gas processing complex, Structures A & E. The project, which is slated to add 277 Bcf/y, is expected to begin production in 2027.50 The NOC has proposed several other natural gas development projects, notably Atshan in the southwestern region, two projects in the Hamada Basin region, and the offshore Bouri Gas Utilization project; some of these projects are in early stages of development. Libya’s natural gas consumption totaled 305 Bcf in 2023 and accounted for more than 70% of domestic production after 2020.51 The electric power sector drives Libya’s domestic natural gas demand, accounting for about 85% of Libya’s domestic natural gas use in 2022. The country’s major industries and its oil sector consume the remainder.52 Libya’s natural gas production is not able to fully meet domestic natural gas demand and export commitments, and the electric power sector often burns petroleum products when the natural gas supply is disrupted or is insufficient during the peak summer season.53 Libya ranked as the seventh-highest natural gas flaring country in 2023, when it vented or flared approximately 240 Bcf in 2023, up from 191 Bcf in 2022 and the highest in a decade. Flaring increased because Libya’s associated gas production rose in tandem with crude oil production during 2023.54 Libya lacks sufficient natural gas infrastructure, particularly processing plants, to capture natural gas from fields associated with oil production and to transport it to demand centers or power plants. Libya plans to eliminate natural gas flaring by 2030. Libya’s NOC is in discussions with international oil companies to reduce flaring, increase the production of marketed natural gas, and free up more oil for export.55 Energy Trade Petroleum and other liquids Libya exported an estimated 1 million b/d of crude oil and condensates in 2023, up from 930,000 b/d in 2022. The oil supply disruption to many of the eastern fields in Libya in the summer of 2022 affected that year’s export levels, which declined from nearly 1.2 million b/d in 2021.74 Most of Libya’s crude oil is sold to European countries. In 2023, Europe’s imports accounted for about 78% of Libya’s crude oil and condensate exports. Most of Libya’s exports went to Italy, Germany, and Spain. Asia, mostly China, received an estimated 10% of Libya’s oil exports in 2023. Libya sent a greater share of its crude oil and condensates to Europe in 2023 (78%, up from 72% in 2022) because Russia shifted more of its crude oil away from Europe to Asia and because China purchased more of Iran’s crude oil. According to trade data, Libya is a net importer of petroleum products as a result of its low operational refining capacity. Petroleum product imports rose in 2023 to nearly 200,000 b/d from less than 150,000 b/d in 2021 as a result of higher oil demand.75 Libya highly subsidizes its oil products to customers, which drives up oil demand. These subsidies also distort market prices and is one of the causes for significant levels of fuel smuggling.76Libya imports primarily gasoline and diesel fuel, and it exports mostly naphtha. In 2023, Russia captured a larger share (29%, up from 5% in 2022) of Libya’s oil product import market after Europe and the G7 countries instituted a price cap on Russia’s petroleum product sales in early 2023.77 Natural gas The Greenstream natural gas pipeline connects Mellitah on Libya’s northwestern coast to Gela, Italy, and became the only outlet of natural gas exports after armed conflict from the civil war destroyed the country’s sole liquefaction terminal in 2011. Libya’s natural gas exports reached around 200 Bcf in 2019, the most recent high, but fell by more than half to 89 Bcf in 2023, well below the pipeline’s capacity of 283 Bcf/y.78 Libya’s reduced natural gas production and higher domestic demand have hindered exports during the past few years. Also, Libya’s large Mellitah natural gas processing plant, which processes most of Libya’s natural gas, has gone offline for maintenance, technical, or political issues several times during the past few years, limiting export levels.79 Electricity Libya, which has electricity interconnections with Tunisia and Egypt, began to import significantly more electric power from these neighboring countries after 2015. Libya’s electricity imports reached more than 0.8 TWh in 2022.80 Egypt plans to expand its interconnection capacity to Libya from 150 MW to 2 GW, but as of September 2024, the expansion date is unknown.81 Source: This article was published by the EIA Endnotes: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook, August 2024.

Bangladesh-India Relations Could Deteriorate Further – Analysis	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury Disintegrating relations between Dhaka and New Delhi could grow even worse as India’s government mobilizes political support for ex-Bangladesh leader Sheikh Hasina, who fled to the neighboring country in August, and her deposed party, analysts warned. They said Narendra Modi’s government likely wouldn’t deal with the interim administration headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, nor any of Dhaka’s political parties, because of previous anti-Indian politics and worries about instability in India’s northeastern states. Those are separated from the mainland by Bangladesh territory. 'The way the bilateral relationship deteriorated over the last three months indicates that Bangladesh-India relations are unlikely to improve. It seems that in the coming days, the relations will worsen further,' Nizam Uddin Ahmed, a political commentator and retired professor at Bangladesh’s Chattogram University, told BenarNews on Tuesday. Bilateral ties chilled after Hasina’s resignation and the collapse of her Awami League administration in early August, amid massive anti-government protests by university students. New Delhi has been a longtime ally of Hasina and backed an independence movement led by her father in 1971, when Bangladesh – then known as East Pakistan – broke free of Islamabad rule. The climate between the two countries has become especially heated in recent days. On Monday, Hindu protesters in northeastern India broke into a Bangladeshi consulate. On Tuesday, the Bangladesh government summoned the Indian ambassador to lodge a protest over that attack. Indian media and news reports said the protesters in Tripura state were agitating against last week’s arrest in Bangladesh of a Hindu leader from that country, Chinmoy Krishna Das. India is likely to keep supporting a movement led by Chinmoy, a Hindu monk. His movement has sought protection for Hindus, who are a religious minority in Bangladesh, following the fall of the Awami League government. 'All political parties of India are united on the issue of Bangladesh after Hasina fled to India. Hasina’s Awami League [AL] government had given everything India asked for to ensure New Delhi’s economic and strategic interests. But now, the interim government and the incoming government would maintain a total opposite role,' Ahmed said. Chinmoy was detained on Nov. 26 for allegedly desecrating the Bangladesh flag. A bail hearing on Tuesday was postponed until early January. Two days after the monk was jailed, Hindu protesters assembled in front of the Bangladesh deputy high commission in Kolkata, burned the Bangladeshi flag and effigies of Yunus and chanted anti-Dhaka slogans. India will support the Hindu movement to put political and diplomatic pressure on Bangladesh, according to Ahmed. 'The present largest party, BNP, and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami have not maintained a minimum friendly ties with India,' he said, using an abbreviation for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The analyst predicted that Indian officials would try to rehabilitate the Awami League. 'India is our biggest neighbor and the second largest trading partner. We are dependent on them economically. They should have maintained good political relations with India for the benefit of Bangladesh,' Ahmed said. Security concerns Another analyst, Imtiaz Ahmed, a retired professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, said New Delhi would not want the parties that have pushed for anti-India politics to come to power in Bangladesh because of security concerns over its eight landlocked northeastern states. During her 15 years in power, Hasina’s government oversaw efforts to quell anti-Indian rebel groups linked to Bangladesh in those states. 'The anti-Indian politics in Bangladesh and the anti-Bangladesh policy will harm both the countries – socially, politically and economically. It should stop immediately for greater sake,' Imtiaz Ahmed said. 'The ruling BJP may try to keep the issue of Hindu repression in Bangladesh alive,' he said, referring to India’s Bharatiya Janata Party. 'Similarly, the Islamic faith-based parties in Bangladesh will foment anti-Indian sentiment for their political gains while the liberal and secular political parties may suffer,' he said. 'Given the situation, Bangladesh-India bilateral relations are unlikely to improve shortly unless we see a thaw. Ongoing issues Meanwhile, in the wake of the attack on the Bangladeshi diplomatic outpost in Agartala, Tripura, officials announced that all visa and consular services there had been suspended until further notice. Also on Monday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked the Indian government to request that U.N. peacekeepers be deployed to protect religious minorities across the state border in Bangladesh, sparking further debate. Earlier on, students at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) had painted Indian flags on walkways in Dhaka to show disrespect for India. Shafiqul Alam, Yunus’ press secretary, told BenarNews that Bangladesh wanted friendly relations with India, noting the nations share a border of over 4,000 km (2,484 miles). 'We have close historical, cultural and linguistic links with India. We want very friendly relations with India. But the relations must be based on equity, fairness and dignity,' he said. 'We hope that India as a friendly and responsible neighbor will extend support to improve the bilateral relations in line with the expectation of the people.' Smruti Pattanaik, a research fellow at MP-IDSA, a think-tank in New Delhi, expressed concern about the effect of the Agartala attack on relations between the neighbors. 'But we should not take into account the stuff circulated [via] social media. Yes, there are some problems. But I think these will go away after some days and relations will normalize,' she told BenarNews. 'It must normalize. 'Our leaders should sit, find ways to fix the problems in the bilateral relations. We need to go forward,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek40eumd5xfMx	2024-12-03T16:29:47-08:00	
What’s Needed Now: A Calm Conversation About Whether World Would ...	No one should be surprised that Moscow is persecuting those who openly call for the demise of the Russian Federation, Sergey Chernyshov says; but at least equally surprising is the failure of opposition leaders and the media 'are categorically refusing to talk about the liquidation of the Russian Federation in its current form.' Such a conversation is 'extremely necessary,' the Radio Liberty analyst says; because 'if it is shown that a world without Russia in its current form would be better than the world with it, then why should we cling to this political formation?' (sibreal.org/a/kak-rasselit-barak-rossiyskaya-federatsiya-istorik-sergey-chernyshov-o-razumnom-separatizme/33219637.html). Of course, it is the case that 'a conversation about the liquidation of the Russian Federation is extremely difficult to begin, as difficult of beginning a conversation about sex in a Puritanical family.' And thus it is not surprising 'but true' that in Russian history, 'there has never been a single significant political force that has raised the issue of dividing the country.' 'Even the numerous ‘national movements’ which arose in the 19th century across the entire empire in fact raised the question not about the liquidation of a single country but about its ‘reformatting,’' Chernyshov says. And those who have wanted to do that have first wanted to seize power in the center. There is an entirely understandable reason for that: 'outdated countries have been effectively liquidated only in one case when this has happened at the behest of the supreme central power which has then acted decisively and effectively in this field,' the historian continues. 'The British empire was liquidated in the British parliament in London and not in the jungles of Africa,' Chernyshov points out; and 'the USSR fell apart not because three nationalist politicians assembled in Beloveshchaya and signed something there but because a fourth politician in Moscow agreed with them.' That needs to be recognized as must be recognized something else, he argues: until that condition is met, the population will overwhelmingly talk about reforming the country of which they are a part rather than seeking to go their own way. The latter option is almost always the choice of local elites with their own calculations. Such elites will succeed initially if they have an ally in Moscow, but they will succeed over time only if they are able to give their peoples a better life, one that others will envy. If the first doesn’t arise, dissolution is unlikely; if the second doesn’t happen, there will always be those who will want to restore the past, Chernyshov concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek4uDkM6vvIW0	2024-12-03T16:27:26-08:00	
Second Fall Of Aleppo Marks New Phase In Syrian Civil War – Analy...	By Paulo Aguiar The swift capture of Aleppo by rebel forces, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), marks a pivotal turning point in the Syrian civil war. This development not only highlights the fragility of Bashar al-Assad’s regime but also underscores how regional and broader international dynamics are reshaping the conflict. The city, which symbolized the Assad regime’s resurgence after its recapture in 2016, is once again at the center of Syria’s shifting battlefield. The rebels’ lightning advance reflects deeper geopolitical currents. The Ukraine war has taken a toll on Russia, Assad’s most powerful ally, while Iran and Hezbollah are grappling with the fallout from Israel’s military campaigns. Meanwhile, Turkey has leveraged the situation to expand its influence in northern Syria by utilizing HTS as a proxy force. These overlapping dynamics have given rise to a volatile environment, making Aleppo’s fall a critical turning point. HTS: From Insurgent Group to Major Player Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) has evolved significantly since its origins as an offshoot of al Qaeda in Syria. After splitting from its parent organization and consolidating power in Idlib, HTS has established itself as the dominant force in Syria’s northwestern rebel-held areas. Operating under Turkish protection, the group has transformed Idlib into a de facto Islamist state, with functioning governance structures, military discipline, and strategic autonomy. This transformation has made HTS a potent actor on Syria’s battlefield. Its leadership has sought to distance itself from the group’s jihadist roots, projecting an image of pragmatism and moderation, at least compared to other Islamist factions. This strategy has helped HTS consolidate power and attract Turkish support, even as it remains classified as a terrorist organization by the United States. The Aleppo offensive showcases HTS’s growth into a cohesive and capable military force. The group’s fighters demonstrated effective coordination, utilizing modern tactics and weaponry, including drone warfare—a hallmark of contemporary conflicts, starting with the Ukraine war. The rapid pace of the advance, which cut through Assad’s forces in a matter of days, underscores HTS’s enhanced capacity and strategic planning. Turkey’s Strategic Calculations Turkey’s role in the Aleppo offensive is complex and multifaceted. While Ankara has not explicitly claimed involvement, its influence is unmistakable. Turkish-backed Sunni militias fought alongside HTS in the offensive, and the timing of the attack—amid regional distractions—suggests coordination with Turkey’s strategic goals. Turkey’s interests in northern Syria are twofold. First, Ankara seeks to establish a safe zone along its border to manage the ongoing refugee crisis. The flow of millions of Syrians into Turkey over the years has strained its economy and fueled domestic political tensions. By securing areas like Aleppo through proxies such as HTS, Turkey can create conditions for some refugees to return. Second, Turkey aims to weaken Assad’s grip on northern Syria, expanding its sphere of influence while underminingKurdish autonomy in the northeast. Allowing HTS to govern captured areas offers Turkey a means to extend control without directly administering the territory, a move that reduces costs and avoids direct confrontation with global powers. However, Turkey’s support for HTS is not without risks. While Ankara benefits from the group’s military success, its association with HTS complicates Turkey’s relationships with Western allies and may heighten tensions with Israel due to the perception of supporting a group with extremist and anti-Israel tendencies. Assad’s Weakening Regime For Assad, the fall of Aleppo is a devastating blow that exposes the deepening fragility of his regime. Once hailed as a leader who had weathered the storm of civil war, Assad now faces mounting challenges, notably economic collapse; fragmentation of state power, where authority is now exercised via third-parties like militias and local power brokers; and a weakening of external allies like Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. Assad’s inability to defend Aleppo underscores how dependent his regime remains on external support. Without Russia’s air power or Hezbollah’s ground forces, his military is largely incapable of holding major urban centers, let alone launching counteroffensives. The loss of Aleppo also disrupts Assad’s broader strategy of projecting stability to attract international recognition and economic relief. The Waning Reach of Russia Russia’s intervention in 2015 marked a turning point in the Syrian civil war, allowing the Assad regime to recapture key territories and gradually consolidate power. However, Moscow’s focus has shifted dramatically since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The ongoing conflict there has drained Russia’s resources, including its air force, which was instrumental in previous Syrian campaigns. The strain on Russia’s military capabilities, coupled with heavy losses in Ukraine, has left Moscow unable to provide the same level of support to Assad. In the Aleppo offensive, Russian airstrikes were limited and ineffective, reflecting Moscow’s reduced capacity. With Russia prioritizing its interests in Ukraine and safeguarding its Mediterranean bases in Syria, Assad is increasingly left to fend for himself. The Iran-Hezbollah Axis Under Pressure Iran and Hezbollah, once Assad’s most reliable allies, are also grappling with significant challenges: Iran is facing a relentless Israeli air campaign targeting its proxies in Syria and Lebanon. These strikes have weakened Tehran’s ability to project power and support Assad effectively. Hezbollah, instrumental in the 2016 battle for Aleppo, is reeling from its confrontation with Israel. The militia has suffered heavy casualties, including the loss of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and lacks the capacity to redeploy significant forces to Syria. With both Iran and Hezbollah preoccupied and weakened, Assad’s reliance on this alliance is becoming increasingly untenable. The (Second) Fall of Aleppo: A Geopolitical Gamechanger? The complete rebel victory in Aleppo has far-reaching consequences. For one, it boosts Turkey’s regional influence. By backing HTS and extending its reach into northern Syria, Ankara is solidifying its position as a key power broker. This development could reshape the balance of power in Syria and complicate efforts to negotiate a lasting peace. It also represents a strategic opportunity for Israel. The collapse of the Assad-Iran-Hezbollah axis in Aleppo could divert resources and attention away from Israel, allowing it to sustain pressure on Gaza and other fronts as needed. It goes without saying that the fall of Aleppo is a disaster for the Assad regime, which faces the prospect of losing more territory and even shrinking into a statelet of Damascus and its surrounding areas, further solidifying the fragmentation of Syria. The fall of Aleppo is not just a military setback for Assad; it signals the beginning of a new phase in the Syrian civil war. The collapse of regime frontlines that were painstakingly secured by Russia and Iran exposes the vulnerabilities of Assad’s government and raises questions about the future of the conflict. As HTS consolidates its gains and Turkey maneuvers for greater control, the coming months will determine whether Assad can regroup or if his regime will continue to unravel. What’s clear is that the Syrian civil war, far from being frozen, is once again shifting in ways that could have profound consequences for the region.

Deepening The Franco-Saudi Partnership – OpEd	By Khattar Abou Diab The French flag is fluttering alongside the Saudi flag in Riyadh during French President Emmanuel Macron’s ongoing three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia. As the highest level of diplomatic engagement, this visit reflects the strong ties between the two nations and the close rapport between Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.By visiting a nation in the midst of significant change and which is a key player in a volatile region, the French president seeks to solidify France’s influence in an area critical to addressing global challenges.Through a series of meetings with the crown prince, Macron aims to build on his prior experience with the Kingdom, including its pivotal role in brokering a ceasefire in Lebanon, to deepen trust between the two nations and address the pressing crises affecting the region. Against the backdrop of global instability, and just weeks ahead of the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency, this visit also provides an opportunity to shape the vision for a unique, multifaceted partnership between Riyadh and Paris.Sources within the French presidency have described Macron’s third visit to Saudi Arabia since taking office at the Elysee Palace as 'exceptional,' highlighting its unique context and critical themes. This return to one of France’s historic allies comes at a time of significant local transformation since his brief second visit in 2021 and amid heightened regional instability following the events of Oct. 7, 2023.The goal of revitalizing Franco-Saudi strategic relations is to lay the foundation for 'a shared and renewed ambition' over the next decade, guided by a joint action plan aligned with the objectives of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, according to the Elysee. Under the leadership of the crown prince, this vision is steering Saudi Arabia toward economic transformation and increased openness. France aims to leverage this opportunity to reaffirm its support for and active participation in this ambitious initiative.Bilateral coordination will focus on key projects and events hosted by Saudi Arabia, such as the 2030 World Expo and the 2029 Asian Winter Games, creating opportunities for both nations to collaborate and invest in these ambitious initiatives. Paris aims to solidify 'France’s position as a key and reliable partner for Saudi Arabia,' supporting the Kingdom’s vision for economic diversification as well as its cultural and tourism ambitions.It considers the pioneering development project in AlUla, in which France plays a key role, as 'an example of what the two nations can accomplish together.'For both sides, the volatile international situation and ongoing regional crises offer an opportunity to 'advance peace and security initiatives within the region and beyond, while tackling global challenges.' On the political agenda, discussions will address urgent issues such as the crises in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria, alongside broader regional tensions.On the Gaza conflict, Paris commends Riyadh’s efforts through the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as well as its initiative to establish an international coalition for the creation of a Palestinian state and the two-state solution. Discussions will center on working with Saudi Arabia to secure a ceasefire in Gaza 'as soon as possible,' facilitate the release of hostages, protect civilians and ultimately chart a path toward a political resolution to the war. Paris also views the ceasefire in Lebanon as a potential lever to support a ceasefire in Gaza.Undoubtedly, the Lebanese crisis will be a focal point of the discussions. The focus will be on facilitating the election of a president to end the leadership vacuum and ensuring the formation of a stable government. Both nations are expected to align their efforts within the framework of the five-member committee — alongside the US, Egypt and Qatar — to address Lebanon’s ongoing constitutional crisis.France seeks to work closely with Saudi Arabia, as the Elysee sources have noted, 'to reinforce the ceasefire, provide support to the Lebanese army and focus on advancing the reconstruction process.'On a broader level, the talks between the crown prince and President Macron will focus on promoting 'regional stability.' Talks between the two leaders will focus on enhancing 'cooperation in key strategic areas,' such as defense, security, energy transition and connectivity.This trip is unlikely to yield any major arms contracts, despite the notable presence of senior defense officials in the French delegation tied to key projects such as the Rafale fighter jet, surveillance satellites and A400M military transport aircraft.The discussions will go beyond these sectors, according to an Elysee source, who noted: 'Talks will also explore future investment opportunities in areas such as fintech, cyberspace and artificial intelligence, especially with France set to host the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit next February.'Macron’s packed schedule highlights the importance of this visit at a crucial time for both partners. • Khattar Abou Diab is a French-Lebanese political scientist specializing in Islam and the Middle East, and director of the 'Conseil Géopolitique — Perspectives.'

Senator Ted Cruz Demands Probe Into European Influence On AI Poli...	(EurActiv) -- Republican Senator Ted Cruz has urged US officials to investigate whether European governments have tried to unduly influence the country’s laws around artificial intelligence (AI). The UK hosted the world’s first global AI safety summit last year, bringing tech executives, world leaders and academics together to discuss a coordinated approach on regulation. Some countries have since set up their own AI safety institutes, which have continued to share expertise across borders. Cruz, who ran against Donald Trump in the Republican Party's 2016 race for presidential nominee, is among the party's most influential senators. He has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden's approach to tech regulation. In a letter addressed to US attorney general Merrick Garland, dated Nov. 21 but only made public on Monday, Cruz said European governments had imposed heavy-handed regulations on US AI companies abroad, and were now trying to steer the direction of AI regulations at home. Cruz described these regulations as 'onerous' and a product of the 'radical left'. 'While the Biden-Harris administration may not want to inform the American people of just how closely they are collaborating with foreign governments, at the very least, the American people have a right to know what foreign actors are trying to impose these radical regulations on American companies,' Cruz wrote. The European Union has led the global charge for regulations tailored to AI technology, having this year passed the AI Act, the world's first sweeping set of laws governing the technology. Cruz cited a memorandum of understanding the US issued alongside Britain in April, as well as a treaty signed by the Biden administration and several European governments, as examples of foreign influence over domestic AI policy. Cruz also said the Centre for the Governance of Artificial Intelligence (GovAI), a UK-based non-profit organisation which recently co-hosted a summit for AI policy experts in San Francisco, had not followed the law by failing to register as a foreign agent despite engaging in political activities. 'GovAI is aware of the request made by Sen. Cruz to the Department of Justice, and, if required, will cooperate fully with the relevant authorities,' a GovAI spokesperson said.

Brazil: Economy Grows 0.9% In Third Quarter Of 2024	By Bruno de Freitas Moura The Brazilian economy grew by 0.9 percent from the second to the third quarter of the year, driven by the industry and services sectors, marking its 13th consecutive expansion. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—the total of all goods and services produced in the country—rose by 4 percent. In the four quarters to date, Brazil's economy has grown by 3.1 percent. The data were released on Tuesday (Dec. 3) by the government´s statistics agency IBGE. At current values, GDP stands at BRL 3 trillion. By sector, services and industry grew by 0.9 and 0.6 percent, respectively, from the second to the third quarter. Agriculture was the only sector to decline, contracting by 0.9 percent. With the newly released results, GDP and the services sector have returned to record levels. However, the industry remains 4.7 percent below its peak in the third quarter of 2013. The 0.9 percent growth in the third quarter was lower than the 1.4 percent increase recorded between the first and second quarters of 2024. Employment and income Rebeca Palis, the IBGE's National Accounts coordinator, attributed the positive quarterly result to factors related to employment and income. 'We continue to see several positive effects, such as a strong labor market. Inflation is above target, but not at extremely high levels, and the government is maintaining its income transfer policy,' she says, noting that the unemployment rate has reached historically low levels. Palis suggests that the slowdown in growth from 1.4 percent in the second quarter to 0.9 percent in the third quarter is not yet the result of the increase in the basic interest rate by the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) in September, from 10.5 to 10.75 percent per year.' 'It takes a while to have a greater effect on economic activity. The third quarter doesn't have such an impact, even though interest rates are at a high level,' she says. She adds that the basis of comparison is high, which means that increases are less significant. Year-to-date From the beginning of the year to the third quarter of 2024, GDP grew by 3.3 percent compared to the same period in 2023. In this comparison, agriculture (-3.5%) declined, while industry (3.5%) and services (3.8%) expanded. IBGE also reported that the GDP growth for 2023, previously published as 2.9 percent, has been revised upward to 3.2 percent.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQekzliLstpT1dl	2024-12-03T16:10:12-08:00	
Seychelles: Two New Zambian Justices Sworn In To Court Of Appeal	By Sedrick Nicett Two new Zambian justices were sworn in to the Court of Appeal of Seychelles on Monday morning, and they started their duties immediately. The two non-resident justices, Dominic Sichinga and Nicola Sharpe-Phiri, both took their oaths on Monday in a ceremony at State House before the President of Seychelles, Wavel Ramkalawan, along with the Vice-President, Ahmed Afif, the Chief Justice, Ronny Govinden, the President of the Court of Appeal, Anthony Fernando, the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Gervais Henrie, other justices of appeal, and members of the Constitutional Appointees Authority (CAA). In his address during the ceremony, Ramkalawan reiterated the fact that such appointments are not chosen by the President himself but by the CAA, which has two members appointed by the President and two appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly. With 22 years of experience, Justice Dominic Sichinga has served as Zambia's Solicitor General, a legal consultant at the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a judge in charge of Zambia's Kabwe High Court for 12 years, and a judge of appeal for seven years. From 1992 to 1994, he was employed by Budd Martin Burrett in the UK as a nascent advocate. In the United States, he also served as an administrative officer on the Kosovo Law Enforcement Project from 1992 to 1994 and as a child support officer in the Office of the Attorney General of Texas from 1999 to 2003. While serving as permanent secretary at Zambia's Ministry of Transport, Works, and Communications, he gained experience in senior management. He has experience in litigation and adjudicating in a wide range of appeals, including Human Rights Law, Constitutional Law, and General Civil Law. On the other hand, prior to her appointment as a judge of the Court of Appeal in April 2021, Justice Nicola Sharpe-Phiri had 20 years of experience in private practice, six years as a High Court judge at the Lusaka High Court, and five years as a judge-in-charge at the Family & Children Court. She served on the Judiciary's Advisory Committee on Training and Continuing Education while serving as Judge-in-Charge of the Family & Children's Division from 2017 to 2021. She presently holds several positions in the judiciary, such as Chairperson of Zambia's Small Claims Court. She is also a member of the Judicial Institute for Africa's (JIFA) Appraisal Performance Committee and Zambia's Judiciary Focal Point Person. In addition, she serves as the vice president of the Zambia Association of Women Judges (ZAWJ), a member of the Commonwealth Association of Magistrates and Judges, a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb), and a commercial arbitrator. As a judge, she also adjudicates appeals from subordinate courts. In her capacity as Justice of Appeal, she adjudicates in civil and criminal appeals. Her other areas of interest are Family Law, Constitutional Law, Banking and Corporate Law, and Arbitration.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek2gWWBmRxHQw	2024-12-03T16:03:16-08:00	
Want More Young People To Join The Military? Spend Less On It – O...	The military is concerned about a growing recruitment crisis. Survey after survey reveals young people just aren’t inspired by military service. Ironically, decades of sky-high military spending — and the endless war it enabled — may have much to do with that. And reversing that trend is critical to making Americans safer. An 18-year-old today will have lived their entire life watching one failed, disastrous war after another. Born in 2006, they would have been an infant when George W. Bush surged troops in Iraq in 2007, years after the infamous 'Mission Accomplished' banner. They would have been in about second grade when ISIS took over much of that country. They could have been eligible to join the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) just as the United States withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years, having only made conditions worse. That same young person would have spent formative years in isolation because of a global pandemic, during whichbillionaires made record wealth gains and used their wealth to buy elections. They would see a country where public schools are underfunded and where neglected infrastructure means lead in drinking water and dams that can’t stand up to newly destructive storms. This reflects the conscious decisions of the government they’re being asked to fight for. In 2024, the U.S. military budget is approaching $1 trillion, more than half of which goes to for-profit military contractors. Year after year, that’s money that hasn’t gone into education, health care, housing, climate or other needs desperately facing young people — and all of us — today. Young people don’t want to sign up for this. Americans under 30 are the only age group where a majority think the military has a negative effect on the country. Younger Americans are also likelier to say the military doesn’t make the world safer. And fewer than one in five of us under 35 say they’re 'extremely proud' to be American — compared to half of those 55 and over. Notably, these Americans also think the United States is on the wrong side in the Middle East. Just one in five younger Americans tell pollsters they support how Israel is conducting its war in Gaza, even as the United States continues to sponsor Israel’s fight through a continuing stream of weapons. And for all that we’ve spent on the military, we’ve consistently failed to protect those who volunteer. With half the budget going to for-profit contractors with multimillionaire CEOs, the troops are often forced to rely on food stamps to get by. Meanwhile, more veterans have died of suicide since 2001 than have died in wars. And our lawmakers have failed to adequately support veterans harmed by burn pits, traumatic brain injury, homelessness and other tragedies of military service. No wonder over half of all Americans now say they’d advise a loved one not to join the military. If we want the best for our country and its young people, we can’t blindly ask them to join an institution they don’t believe in and fight in wars they don’t support for a country that doesn’t have their backs. Instead, we need to invest in a country worth fighting for. For what we’ve spent on wars and the military since 9/11, we could have easily decarbonized the entire U.S. electric grid, completely erased student debt, continued the pandemic-era Child Tax Credit (which cut child poverty in half) for another decade, and much more. It’s not too late to press for those investments, which — unlike the trillions we’ve plowed into the Pentagon and unjust wars — would actually make this country safer. Just ask the young people we’re asking to defend it. Lindsay Koshgarian directs the National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. She wrote this for InsideSources.com.

South Korea’s President Lifts Martial Law Hours After Declaring I...	By Eugene Whong South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol ended martial law, just hours after he declared it to counter 'threats from North Korea' and 'anti-state activities' carried out by the country’s opposition party. According to Yoon’s declaration, martial law would begin at 11 p.m. Tuesday, but the National Assembly voted to lift the decree nearly three hours later as protesters rallied outside. After Yoon’s own party urged him to lift martial law, he announced he would do so early Wednesday, and a meeting of his Cabinet made it official. 'I declare emergency martial law to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces and to eradicate the shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order.' Yoon said in a news conference Tuesday night. Yoon, who represents the conservative People Power Party, did not mention any specific threat from Pyongyang, and the move was seen by some as a reaction to domestic political tension and conflict. It was the first time that martial law was declared in the country since 1980. Under South Korea’s constitution, power can be consolidated around the executive branch if the president declares martial law, but any such declaration can also be voted down by the National Assembly, which the opposition Democratic Party controls. After Yoon’s declaration, protesters gathered outside the National Assembly building in Seoul, chanting for lawmakers to end the state of martial law -- which they eventually did with 190 of the assembly’s 300 members present. Opposition leaders vowed that they would remain on the premises until the president officially rescinds his declaration. Reuters reported at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, Seoul time, that Yoon announced he would lift martial law, and moments later jubilant protesters outside the assembly declared victory. Political frustration 'Everybody is flabbergasted,' Kenneth Choi, the international editor for the The Chosun Daily newspaper said in an interview with CNN. 'It’s absolutely stunning.' 'He (Yoon) is frustrated because the opposition party, which controls about two-thirds of the parliament, has impeached like 18 of his Cabinet ministers,' Choi said. 'And then the opposition party cut down almost US$4 billion in the government budget. So he believes that the opposition party is trying to shut his government down.' US reaction The United States said Tuesday it was watching events in South Korea 'with grave concern' and was seeking to engage with South Korean officials at every level in Washington and Seoul. 'We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,' the second-ranking U.S. diplomat, Kurt Campbell, told reporters in Washington. A spokesperson for the National Security Council told RFA that the U.S. was not notified in advance of Yoon’s announcement. 'We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,' the spokesperson said. David Maxwell, vice president of the Washington-based Center for Asia Pacific Strategy told RFA that Yoon, who faces a very low approval ratings, has nothing to lose, and may have been hoping that the move could hurt the opposition party. He said Yoon may have felt the timing was right for such a bold move. Yoon is 'likely to receive little or no condemnation from the incoming Trump administration as much as there may be from Biden or would be if Harris had won,' said Maxwell, adding that a large scale labor union protest was set to begin in South Korea on Wednesday. He acknowledged that there were risks though, saying that under martial law, South Korean forces might accidentally use inappropriate levels of force in response to protests, the declaration could damage the reputation of conservative politicians, and that North Korea could find ways to exploit the situation. Yoon’s declaration of martial law drew condemnation from his political opponents. Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon and is the leader of the Democratic Party, said that the military should not rule South Korea. 'President Yoon’s illegal declaration of emergency martial law is null and void,' said Lee. Han Dong-hoon, the leader of Yoon’s own People Power Party and South Korea’s justice minister until last year, said on Facebook that the 'martial law declaration was wrong,' and that he would work alongside the people to stop it.

Contrary To What The Washington Post Says, China Is Doing A Huge ...	The Washington Post had a bizarre article last week in which it questioned whether China was doing much to combat global warming. While the piece noted China’s efforts to portray itself as a world leader in this effort, it commented: 'But China’s global climate leadership bid is complicated by its own enormous emissions. The country has been the world’s largest producer of atmosphere-warming greenhouse gases for nearly two decades, although the United States has released more in total since industrialization. 'China continues to rely heavily on coal power, a leading source of carbon dioxide. In the early years of climate talks, Chinese officials were often accused of spoiling deals with concerns that stronger commitments would undermine Chinese economic growth. 'Beijing also resisted pressure from Western nations before the talks this month to make an early announcement of targets to reduce emissions by 2035 and to join developed nations in contributing cash to help poor countries address the catastrophic impacts of climate change and to transition away from reliance on fossil fuels.' +++ 'But Beijing has done little so far to back up its statements with action. ‘To play a leadership role requires more than just saying they are committed to the Paris agreement,’ she [Belinda Schäpe, China policy analyst with the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finland-based research group] said.' China is the world’s leading emitter primarily because, until last year, it was the most populous country in the world. Presumably the Post’s climate reporters are aware of this fact. On a per capita basis it still emits about half as much as the United States. Also, China’s emissions figures are misleading since it has an enormous surplus in trade of manufactured goods. This means that many of the emissions that are attributed to China support living standards in Europe, the United States, and other countries with whom it runs a trade surplus. If its trade surplus were smaller, its emissions would be lower and emissions in other countries would be higher. Also, China has made enormous progress in controlling its emissions even though it is a rapidly growing developing country catching up to Western living standards. It has invested a huge amount of money in its solar and wind industry and now has close to half the entire world’s capacity in both. It is now projected to be at or near its peak emissions level, with declines in the future. This is well ahead of its targets in the Paris Agreement. Also, contrary to what is claimed in this piece, China is offering massive support to developing countries in their transitions to green economies. It is selling EVs, solar panels, batteries and other clean technologies at hugely subsidized prices. To get an idea of the size of this aid, suppose that China exports 10 million EVs a year(not far above its current level of car exports) at an average subsidy of $10,000 each. This would be equivalent to $100 billion in aid for the green transition. If it had comparable subsidies on solar panels, batteries and other green technologies, that would come to $200 billion a year. This is far more than is being put on the table by the United States and other wealthy countries. It would be useful if the Post could try to do a more serious analysis in its pieces on global warming.

Ukraine Again Calls For Full Membership As NATO Ministers Meet In...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has again called for membership in NATO, saying that only joining the alliance in full would guarantee its future security as it fights to stave off Russia's nearly three-year-old full-scale assault. 'We are convinced that the only such real guarantee of security for Ukraine, as well as a deterrent factor for further Russian aggression against Ukraine and other states, is only Ukraine's full membership in NATO,' Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement released ahead of a December 3 meeting of the alliance's foreign ministers in Brussels. In reaction to the ministry's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dimtry Peskov said on December 3 that Ukraine's joining NATO would be 'unacceptable' and a 'threat' to Russia. The statement comes just days after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Sky News that Ukraine's NATO admittance could end what he described as the 'hot phase of the war' triggered by Russia when it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Zelenskiy told Sky News on November 30 that he would be willing to consider a cease-fire if Ukraine’s unoccupied territories fell under NATO's protection, as long as an invitation to join the alliance recognized Ukraine's international borders.'If we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we need to take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control,' Zelenskiy said.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha is set to brief his NATO counterparts in Brussels on the current situation on the eastern front, where Russian troops have been making incremental but steady advances against Kyiv's outnumbered and outgunned forces.The meeting in Brussels is to focus on NATO's continued military support for Ukraine, examine Kyiv's air-defense needs, and also discuss Russia's launching last month of an experimental ballistic missile against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.Russia has said that the new medium-range missile, called Oreshnik, can also strike targets across Europe and cannot be stopped by air defenses. On December 3, Zelenskiy announced that Ukraine had conducted a test on new, domestically developed missiles. 'We thank our Ukrainian missile developers. We're speeding up production,' Zelenskiy said on Telegram after a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian military. Russian hybrid attacks and sabotage incidents against NATO members is also due to be discussed in Brussels.Early on December 3, Russia launched yet another drone attack on Ukraine that was largely repelled by Ukrainian air defenses, which shot down 22 out of the 28 incoming drones over nine regions -- Kyiv, Chernihiv, Vinnytsya, Khmelnytskiy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Odesa, Mykolayiv, and Dnipropetrovsk. Russian shelling also killed a woman early on December 3 in the Dnipro district of the southern region of Kherson, local officials reported.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek2lG2xj0er0V	2024-12-03T15:42:48-08:00	
From Chancay To Shanghai: China Undercuts The US In Peru – Analys...	By Hari Seshasayee The Chinese-built Chancay port in Peru should be seen by many as a harbinger of a new era in Latin America, one where Beijing holds as much sway as Washington in Latin America. This is the culmination of years of geopolitical maneuvering by China to court countries that were previously in the United States’ sphere of influence. The timing is crucial: China’s coaxing of Latin America is juxtaposed with the US distancing itself from the region by threatening to impose tariffs and clamp down on illegal immigration, which leaves little room for new economic engagement. It is thus natural that China’s willingness to expand its stake in Latin America and build much-needed infrastructure projects is seen by governments in the region as a welcome opportunity. Whether newly elected president Donald Trump will be willing to set aside the irritants in the US-Latin America relationship and instead make economic overtures to the region remains to be seen. The Chancay port forms part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), joining a long list of BRI projects in the region, including 'roads through the jungles of Costa Rica; railways in Bolivia and Argentina; industrial parks and a container port in Trinidad and Tobago; the biggest hydroelectric plant in Ecuador; and the first transoceanic fiber-optic cable directly connecting Asia to South America, stretching from China to Chile, among other projects.' Currently, 22 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean have signed on to BRI, and Colombia may soon be added to that list. Chancay may be one of the more successful BRI projects that China has executed, but it should not overshadow other BRI projects that have been left languishingdue to political corruption, labor violations, environmental issues or public protests. Yet, credit should be given where it is due. China has already been South America’s largest trading partner for over a decade; Chancay may well catapult South America-China trade to even higher levels. The saying ‘Chancay to Shanghai’ has become ubiquitous in Peru, a nod bridging the massive distance between Latin America’s Pacific coast to China’s economic hubs. At face value, the Chancay port is impressive: a sleepy fishing village 80kms from Lima has been transformed into one of South America’s largest ports, thanks to a $1.3 billion investment by China’s Cosco Shipping in the project’s first phase. The port is expected to generate $4.5 billion in annual revenue and will create more than 8,000 jobs, all while reducing trade costs between Peru and China by 20%. The first ship from Chancay, Peru to China is set to sail this week carrying fruits from the Andean country. Moreover, Chancay is a modern port, built to withstand earthquakes of upto 8.5 magnitude, and is nearly fully-automated with unmanned electric vehicles used to move containers, automated cranes to load and unload merchandise, facial recognition systems to ensure security, radio frequency systems to track goods and 5G internet throughout the port. Much of the port’s systems and infrastructure have been brought in by the Chinese, with BYD pick-up trucks and Huawei 5G towers. The port is controlled by China’s Cosco Shipping, which has a 60% stake in the project, and a Peruvian mining company, Volcan, which holds the remaining 40% stake. Although Chancay and Peru seems to be the cynosure of all eyes, China’s ambitions with this project reach beyond Peru. Chancay’s primary motive is to serve as a springboard to Asia from Latin America’s Pacific coast, reducing the voyage from Peru to China from 35 to 23 days, but it also has two important consequences with regards to global maritime trade. The first is short-term. Previously, vessels from South America’s Pacific coast would make the journey to Asia via Mexico’s Manzanilla port or California’s Long Beach – both those ports will now see less traffic emanating from South America. The second consequence is long-term and yet unknown. It is linked to another large infrastructure project that aims to connect Peru with neighboring countries in order to give them easy access to Asia via the Pacific. According to the director of Peru’s Chancay Chamber of Commerce, 'China’s main motivation for developing the megaport was access to neighboring Brazil, where a new railway line is planned to carry Brazilian exports such as soybeans and iron ore to the port.' The newly planned railway line between Brazil and Peru could cost up to $3.5 billion, but is far from becoming a reality. On a similar vein, Peruvian Transport Minister Raul Perez Reyes notes that his country’s goal 'is to become the Singapore of Latin America, so that port cargo passes through here when going to Asia. When someone from Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina wants to go to Asia, they should think of Peru as a point of departure.' It is likely that certain goods may now traverse from other Latin American ports in the Pacific to Chancay and then head to Asia via this new trade route. Yet, the loftier plans to connect Peru’s coast by road with Brazil and other neighboring countries, dubbed the ‘Bi-Oceanic Railway,’ traversing from Brazil’s Southeastern cost in the Atlantic to Peru’s Chancay, may still be a pipedream.

The ‘Price Stability’ Myth Undermines Our Economy And Well-Being ...	By Frank Shostak For most commentators, a 'stable price level' is the key for economic stability. For instance, let us say that there is a relative increase in consumer demand for potatoes versus tomatoes. This relative increase is depicted, all things being equal, by the relative increase in the price of potatoes. To be successful, businesses must pay attention to consumer demand. Failing to do so is likely to lead to losses. Hence, by paying attention to relative changes in prices, producers are likely to increase the production of potatoes versus tomatoes. According to many economists, if the 'price level' is not 'stable,' then the visibility of the relative price changes becomes blurred and, consequently, businesses cannot ascertain the relative changes in the demand for goods and services and make correct production decisions. This leads to a misallocation of resources and to the weakening of economic fundamentals. Thinking this way, unstable changes in the price level obscure a business person’s ability to ascertain changes in the relative prices of goods and services. Thus, businesses find it difficult to recognize a change in relative prices when the price level is unstable. Given such presuppositions, it is not surprising that the mandate of the central bank is to pursue policies that will allegedly bring 'price stability' (i.e., a stable price level). By means of various quantitative methods, the Fed’s economists have established that policymakers should aim at keeping the yearly growth rate of prices of goods and services at two percent. Any significant deviation from this figure supposedly constitutes deviation from stable growth. The Assumption of Money Neutrality & 'Price Stability' At the root of price stabilization policies is a view that money is neutral, that is, changes in the money supply only have an effect on the price level while having no effect on the relative prices. For instance, if one apple exchanges for two potatoes then the price of an apple is two potatoes or the price of one potato is half an apple. Now, if one apple exchanges for one dollar, then the price of a potato is $0.50. Note that the introduction of money does not alter the fact that the relative price of potatoes versus apples is 2:1 (two-to-one). Thus, a seller of an apple will get one dollar for it, which, in turn, will enable him to purchase two potatoes. Let us assume that the stock of money has doubled and, as a result, the purchasing power of money has halved, or the price level has doubled. This means that now one apple can be exchanged for two dollars while one potato for one dollar. Despite the doubling in prices, a seller of an apple with the obtained two dollars can still purchase two potatoes. Assuming money neutrality, an increase in the quantity of money leads to a proportionate increase in prices. Conversely, a fall in the quantity of money results in a proportionate decline in the prices. Why is this way of thinking problematic? Money is Not Neutral When new money is injected, there are always first recipients of the newly-injected money who benefit from this injection. The first recipients, with more money at their disposal, can now acquire a greater amount of goods while the prices of these goods are still unchanged. As money starts to move through the economy, the prices of goods begin to rise, unevenly and disproportionately. Consequently, late receivers of the inflated money realize costs from the monetary injections and may even find that most prices have risen so much that they can now afford fewer goods. Artificial increases in money supply generate a redistribution of wealth from later recipients, or non-recipients of money, to the earlier recipients. Obviously, this shift in wealth alters individuals’ demands for goods and services and, in turn, further alters the relative prices of goods and services. Inflationary increases in money supply set in motion new dynamics that give rise to changes in demands for goods and services and to changes in their relative prices. Hence, increases in money supply cannot be neutral. Again, a change in relative demands here is on account of wealth diversion from the latest recipients of money to the earlier recipients. This change in relative demands cannot be sustained without ongoing increases in the money supply. Once the growth rate of the money supply slows down or ceases altogether, various activities that emerged on the back of this inflationary increase in the money supply come under pressure. It follows, then, that an artificial increase in the money supply gives rise to changes in relative prices, which sets in motion an unsustainable structure of production. Hence, the Fed’s monetary policy—which aims at stabilizing the price level—necessarily involves growth in the money supply. Since inflationary changes in the money supply are not neutral, this means that the central bank policy amounts to tampering with relative prices, which leads to the disruption of the efficient allocation of resources. While increases in money supply are likely to be revealed in general price increases, this is not always the case. Prices are determined by real and monetary factors. Consequently, it can occur if the real factors are pulling things in an opposite direction to monetary factors. In such a case, a visible change in prices may not take place. While money growth is buoyant, prices might display moderate increases. If we were to pay attention to changes in the price level and disregard increases in the money supply, we would reach misleading conclusions regarding the state of the economy. On this, Rothbard wrote, The fact that general prices were more or less stable during the 1920s told most economists that there was no inflationary threat, and therefore the events of the great depression caught them completely unaware. There is No 'Price Level' The whole idea of the general purchasing power of money and, therefore, the 'price level' cannot even be established conceptually. When one dollar is exchanged for the one loaf of bread, we can say that the purchasing power of the one dollar is the one loaf of bread. If one dollar is exchanged for two tomatoes, then this also means that the purchasing power of the one dollar is two tomatoes. Such information regarding the specific purchasing power of money at that moment in time does not, however, allow the establishment of the general, total purchasing power of money. It is not possible to ascertain the total purchasing power of money because we cannot meaningfully add up two tomatoes to the one loaf of bread. We can only establish the purchasing power of money with respect to a particular good in a transaction at a given point in time and at a given place. According to Rothbard, Since the general exchange-value, or PPM (purchasing power of money), of money cannot be quantitatively defined and isolated in any historical situation, and its changes cannot be defined or measured, it is obvious that it cannot be kept stable. If we do not know what something is, we cannot very well act to keep it constant. Conclusion For most commentators, the key to healthy economic fundamentals is 'price stability.' A 'stable price level,' it is held, leads to the efficient use of the economy’s scarce resources and hence results in better economic fundamentals. It is not surprising that the mandate of the Federal Reserve is to pursue policies that will supposedly generate price stability. Through monetary policies (inflation) that aim at stabilizing the price level, the Fed actually undermines economic fundamentals. An ever-growing interference of the central bank with the working of markets moves the US economy towards the growth path of persistent economic impoverishment and drastically lower living standards. On the contrary, what is required is not a policy of dubious 'price stability,' but rather allowing free price fluctuations and maintaining sound money. Only in an environment free of central bank tampering can free and voluntary fluctuations in relative prices can take place. This, in turn, permits businesses to abide by consumer instructions.

Vietnam Must Manage Its Trump-Era Expectations – Analysis	By Lena Le On 5 November 2024, the US presidential election drew global attention. In Vietnam, a survey conducted by Tuoi Tre indicated that 76 per cent of respondents supported president-elect Donald Trump, while 24 per cent preferred Vice President Kamala Harris. A VnExpress poll similarly reported 80 per cent backing for Trump. This remarkable level of support is echoed on Facebook and TikTok, where many Vietnamese users appear to favour the president-elect. This preference among Vietnamese social media users may stem from viewing Trump — known for his assertive rhetoric — as a leader capable of reasserting US global leadership. They may also believe he will promote regional stability and assist Vietnam in the South China Sea. But regardless of the motivations behind this support, it would be prudent to temper expectations concerning this assumption. Vietnam will need to swiftly navigate shifts in bilateral trade policies, the long-term consequences of delayed climate action and pressures arising from US–China competition. The US–Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership forged in 2023 importantly does not directly translate into US policies that safeguard Vietnam in disputes. Trump’s previous term and his campaign promises suggest that his administration will pursue fair trade policies, which he positions as essential to creating more US jobs. During Trump’s prior administration, Vietnam agreed to a US$21 billion purchase of Boeing aircraft to help mitigate its trade deficit with the United States. The United States’ trade deficit in goods with Vietnam reached US$104 billion in 2023, placing Vietnam among the top three countries with the highest trade imbalance with the United States. A renewed Trump administration will likely prioritise reducing this deficit as a matter of urgency. Trump’s preference for bilateral trade agreements — viewed as more effective in addressing trade imbalances — may prompt a US withdrawal from the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, established by US President Joe Biden. This speculation is rooted in Trump’s previous actions, including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day in office in 2017, which was a blow to Hanoi. A second Trump administration also plans to impose tariffs of 10–20 per cent on imported goods. Such tariffs would significantly affect Vietnamese exporters, as the United States has been Vietnam’s largest export market in recent years. Industries such as seafood, textiles, tires, furniture and steel would face considerable difficulties, as increased import costs would likely reduce US demand. Trump would have several legal bases to justify these tariffs, including Section 232, Section 301, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Section 122 Balance of Payments Authority. These enable the US president to adjust imports if deemed a national security threat, to address unfair trade practices and to impose temporary import surcharges or quotas to manage balance of payments issues. One should not assume that an increase in tariffs of 40–60 per cent on Chinese goods would automatically benefit Vietnam. The US–China trade war initially drove some companies towards Vietnam as an alternative manufacturing hub. But in a 2019 interview, Trump accused Vietnam of exploiting the trade dispute to expand its exports to the United States. He called the country ‘the single worst abuser of everybody’ and suggested it might become the next trade target. Trump’s trend of withdrawing from multilateral agreements could also lead to a US exit from the Paris Agreement on climate change. While this may not immediately affect Vietnam, it could undercut collective efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. This is particularly concerning for Vietnam, which ranks among the five countries most vulnerable to climate change. In 2023, Vietnam and the United States elevated their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, Vietnam’s highest diplomatic designation. But given Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy — even with close allies — he has often voiced dissatisfaction with what he perceives as an undue burden on the United States. Trump has previously threatened to withdraw US forces from allied nations and pressured allies to substantially increase their financial contributions to US troop presence in 2020. This precedent raises questions about the extent of support the United States might provide to Vietnam under its partnership, particularly in the face of external challenges. Amid the increasingly intense US–China rivalry and Trump’s diplomatic brinkmanship, the president-elect may also demand that Vietnam make greater contributions to US policies in the region. It is possible that Trump may even pressure Vietnam to take sides between the United States and China. These decisions could pertain to security, defence and technological solutions. This poses a challenge that Vietnam has consistently sought to avoid. The Vietnam–US relationship is strategically significant for both sides due to geostrategic and economic considerations. But it will likely face challenges under a renewed ‘America First’ approach that emphasises bilateralism, prioritises US interests and holds allies and partners accountable to US demands.

Ontario Explores Potential New Energy Generation Sites	The provincial government has told Ontario Power Generation to begin discussions to determine community support for all types of new energy generation, including nuclear, at three sites in the southern part of the province. Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator has said the province's demand for electricity is forecast to increase by 75% by 2050 - the equivalent of adding four and a half cities the size of Toronto to the grid, the Government of Ontario said. The increase in demand is being driven by Ontario's rapid increase in population, new manufacturing facilities, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence data centres, the electrification of industry, and the charging energy required for electric vehicles. 'While the province is already on track to meet demands through 2035 with major projects already announced, including Canada's first small modular reactor and the largest competitive energy procurement in Ontario's history, the province will need 16,000 additional megawatts of generation, in addition to new transmission to meet demand in 2050,' the government added. Early community engagement is a critical part of the province's approach to new energy generation. These 'early conversations' ( will look at how communities would be supported and potential benefits to them from generation projects, including equity participation for Indigenous communities, funding for municipal host communities to support community infrastructure investments and attraction of co-located industry, additional income from municipal property taxes, and associated jobs and economic development for municipalities and Indigenous communities. The three sites owned by Ontario Power Generation (OPG) - already Ontario's largest generator - that have been singled out by the government for discussions with Indigenous, community and municipal leaders are at Wesleyville in Port Hope, Nanticoke in Haldimand County and Lambton in St Clair. These sites are already zoned for electricity generation, have proximity to transmission, and are located in Southern Ontario, within regions experiencing significant growth, according to the provincial government. 'As we prepare for the largest expansion of electricity generation in over 30 years, our government is embracing an important opportunity for economic reconciliation among First Nations communities and workers,' Ontario Minister of Indigenous Affairs and First Nations Economic Reconciliation Greg Rickford said. 'By working together with Ontario Power Generation, we are ensuring that First Nations communities are not just part of the conversation, but active participants in shaping a prosperous, sustainable energy future.' OPG President and CEO Ken Hartwick said the company places 'great importance' on relationships with host communities, neighbours, and the Indigenous Nations on whose traditional territory it operates. 'We look forward to meeting with municipalities and Nations to understand their perspectives and aspirations for their communities,' he said. Clean and reliable baseload electricity from nuclear and hydroelectricity are prioritised in the government's vision document, Ontario's Affordable Energy Future, released in October. The provincial government is already supporting Bruce Power in pre-development work on the province's first large-scale nuclear build in 30 years, as well as OPG's plans for four small modular reactors at its Darlington site and the refurbishment of the Pickering Nuclear Generation Station, as part of what Minister of Energy and Electrification Stephen Lecce said is Ontario's largest expansion of electricity generation in more than thirty years. 'To meet soaring energy demands, we're working with communities to plan ahead and build for our future so that we can generate more power that is reliable and affordable for our families today and tomorrow. Our plan will ensure we keep energy bills down and the power on for generations to come,' he said. About the sites According to information from OPG, the three sites are already zoned for electricity generation, have proximity to transmission, and are located in Southern Ontario within regions where a lot of growth is taking place. Wesleyville (Port Hope) covers about 1300 acres, adjacent to Durham Region which hosts Pickering and Darlington nuclear generating stations Nanticoke (Haldimand County) is a former coal generating site, part of which is currently used for a solar facility. It has existing transmission connection with capacity, railway, and dock Lambton (St Clair Township) is a former coal generating site with access to railway and deepwater dock, and the potential to re-use some existing site features from previous generation OPG says it is 'in the early stages of understanding each community’s willingness to explore energy development in their community or territory'. Projects will only be explored if they have a willing host community and Indigenous participation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5gjPzN308STm	2024-12-02T16:15:18-08:00	
Persistent Fall In Private Borrowing Brings Global Debt Down – An...	Global debt decreased about one percentage point to 237 percent GDP. The values for 2023 are now available from the just released IMF’s Global Debt Database. Global private debt fell by 2.8 percentage points to 143 percent of GDP, below the 2019 level and more than compensated for the turning up in public debt. According to the latest Fiscal Monitor, global public debt is high, rising, and risky. Low Growth Prospects Empirical analysis points to low growth prospects as the main driver of the fall in private debt in 2023. The way households and businesses react to current and expected future growth is very important for private debt. Given weak growth prospects many firms and households are opting to pay down debt. The fall in private debt slowed down compared to 2022 mainly because of a reduction in the contribution from unexpected inflation to debt erosion. As a matter of fact, surprise inflation was a major factor in 2021-2022. Since debt is fixed in nominal terms, unexpected inflation can actually erode the real value of debt and lower its ratio to GDP. In 2022, inflation reached levels unprecedented since the Great Inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. A simple way to visualize the relation between private debt, growth and growth prospects is to look at the elasticity of private debt to the difference between growth prospects and current growth (see our Global Debt Monitor). As economic prospects brighten compared to the current situation, households and firms are more inclined to resort to debt financing. In recent years deteriorating growth prospects have made this logic operate in reverse. Addressing private and public debt risks Although declining, in 2023, non-financial corporations and household global debt is elevated at more than $150 trillion. Financial stability risks and policies to mitigate and manage them are comprehensively covered in the Global Financial Stability Report. The role of deteriorating growth prospects in the decline of private debt is a reminder of the unfortunate combination of high debt and low growth that heightens the challenge of balancing the fiscal equation. Chapter 3 of the recent World Economic Outlookemphasizes that structural policies are crucial to deliver sustainable and inclusive growth. The last Fiscal Monitor argues that, in most countries, additional efforts are necessary now to contain public finance risks with a high degree of confidence. But it also argues fiscal has a central role—for example through public investment and policies that support innovation and research—among the structural policies that must be deployed to deliver enduring, sustained, and inclusive growth.

Can You See Why The UN Is Bad At Peace? – OpEd	By Mehdi Alavi The idea of peace in Europe goes back for centuries. Europeans made many agreements in pursuit of peace. The biggest impetus for what later became the United Nations was the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, mostly based on the previous peace agreements. Run by the UK, the US, France and Italy, thirty-two countries attended the conference. The Big Four used the Treaty as a reference to set up the UN foundation in the 1944 Dunbarton Oaks estate in Washington, DC. The UN has been a nightmare. It is as dysfunctional as the League of Nations. The world has not seen peace even for a day since the UN’s inception in 1945. Delegates should have foreseen the UN’s failure in 1945. The organization came into existence for the UK, the US and the Soviets to expand their hegemony across the world. They projected peace for themselves, and not necessarily for the rest of the world. How the Allies became the United Nations On September 1, 1939, World War II started with Germany invading Poland. The United Kingdom (UK) and France declared war on Germany as allies. The Soviet Union (Soviets) invaded eastern Poland on September 17. In June 1941, the Soviets joined the Allies. The Big Three (the UK, the US and the Soviets) formed a united organization of nations to maintain their global peace and security. The Allied powers met and signed the Declaration of St.James Palace, pledging collaboration in fighting aggression. It proclaimed that 'the only true basis of enduring peace is the willing cooperation of free peoples in a world in which, relieved of the menace of aggression, all may enjoy economic and social security.' The US Constitution strictly limits the president’s power and rests the war declaration with Congress. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt short-circuited the Constitution, by authorizing the US to finance and arm the UK and France. In March 1941, Congress put this policy into law in the form of the Lend-Lease Act without the constitutional process of declaring war. Germany and its allies, Italy and Japan (the Axis Powers), of course, considered the US to be aiding the enemy in war. The US later entered the war formally. In December 1941, Japan’s air force attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii, catching the US by surprise. Within days, that attack triggered the US to declare war on Germany. Within hours, Germany also declared war on the US. That month, China joined the Allies while resisting Japan’s expansion in China since 1937. In August 1941, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill signed the Atlantic Charterpledging to stop territorial expansion, engage in free trade, collaborate with other nations, have access to 'high seas and oceans', stop the use of force, and work for a world peace free of 'fear and want', where all individuals are free to choose their form of government and enjoy economic advancement and social security. In January 1942, about four weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Big Three (the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union) and China, along with 22 other countries, signed a document pledging to accept the Atlantic Charter, which is referred to as the Declaration by the United Nations. During World War II, the devastating effect of that war encouraged the Big Three and China, (the Big Four), to put aside their differences and collaborate in the war. To avoid such a war in the future, they began planning for the world. As the discussion progressed, the idea of a united world organization emerged. In October 1943, the Big Four signed the Moscow Declaration, recognizing 'the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security.' In November- December 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for the first time in Tehran, Iran. They discussed the post-war arrangement and partitions. Roosevelt and Churchill assured Stalin that he could expand Soviet territory into Poland and Germany. President Roosevelt was so infatuated with Stalin that he called him Uncle Joe. 'I began to tease Churchill,' the American President boasted, '… Winston got red and scowled and finally Stalin broke into a deep, hearty guffaw. It was then that I called him Uncle Joe.' This cavalier attitude of President Roosevelt regarding Eastern Europe is a typical example of a public servant intoxicated with power, and turning into a despot. Such a cavalier is responsible for the US presidents’ empowering the Zionist genocide against Palestinians and the takeover of Palestine. At the end of the Tehran meeting, they agreed on the Tehran Conference. They said: 'We are sure that our concord will win an enduring peace. We recognize fully the supreme responsibility resting upon us and all the United Nations to make a peace which will command the goodwill of the overwhelming mass of the world’s peoples and banish the scourge and terror of war for many generations.' The victorious Allies founded the UN In October 1944, the Big Four met at Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, DC. They proposed a United Nations consisting of the following: A General Assembly, composed of all the member nations oversees an Economic and Social Council. Nowadays, it oversees other councils, too. A Security Council is composed of eleven members, five permanent and six chosen by the GA for two-year terms. An International Court of Justice. A United Nations Secretariat. After the war, they all wanted to be in control of the global issues. The US had risen to the most powerful one among the Big Three but felt needed Soviet cooperation to finish the war. The Soviets did not trust the UK or the US. They insisted on restoring the old Russian Empire and succeeded. In April 1945, delegates from 46 nations attended the San Francisco Conference and discussed and approved the UN. They set up the UN objectives to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights…to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.' On June 25, 1945, the delegates met in San Francisco. After days of meetings, they unanimously passed the UN Charter. The major debacle was the veto power of the Big Five (the UK, the US, France, the Soviets, and China). Less powerful nations feared that if a veto power threatened peace, the Security Council would lose its significance. They wanted more power distribution. Finally, they went along in the interest of global peace. On September 2, 1945, the war ended. The Big Three decided to expand the United Nations by inviting other nations to join it. The shortcomings of the victors’ peace To ensure their global hegemony, they planned the UN Security Council (UNSC) in the UN. The UK insisted on limiting the UNSC to the UK, the US and the Soviets. The US wanted China to be included because of its strong resistance against Japan, which freed the US to support Europe. To ensure Western control, the UK insisted on adding France to the Council. That is how the Big Five surfaced. The Soviets felt outnumbered by the West and asked for veto power, which was granted to all permanent members. The UN General Assembly (UNGA) is the only organ in the UN in which all member nations vote. Regardless of size or population, each member nation has only one vote. A simple majority decides procedural questions while a simple majority or a two-thirds vote decides substantive ones, depending on importance. It is mainly a deliberative body empowered to make recommendations to the UN Security Council (UNSC) regarding international issues. In contrast, the UNSC is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It is an exclusive club. Nowadays, it has 15 members, 5 of whom are permanent members and endowed with veto power on every issue. The permanent members are the US, the UK, China, France, and Russia, also known as the Big Five. The GA chooses the other ten for two-year terms. Like the League, the UN’s primary purpose has been to preserve peace and security. The UN members have promised not to use force except in self-defense and to use force collectively to preserve peace. In apparent violation of the UN Charter, the veto powers granted to certain member states have led to conflicts and wars, rather than preventing them. Until the fall of the Soviets in December 1991, the world faced two superpowers, the US and the Soviets, competing for global influence, a period known as the Cold War. They incited proxy wars nearly everywhere. Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US emerged as the world’s sole superpower. This shift in global dynamics has led to military interventions and interference in various countries, resulting in significant human suffering and destruction. Presently, the US is responsible for much of the global deaths and destruction, particularly in Iraq, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. The US complicity in the genocide against Palestinians is the talk of the world these days. Given these ongoing challenges, it is clear that the current state of the UN is not conducive to achieving lasting global peace. Meaningful reform or even the dismantling of the organization may be necessary. Adding Brazil, Germany, India, Japan or another country is unlikely to address the fundamental issues.

Is The End Near For The War In Ukraine? – OpEd	By James Fite It has been more than two-and-a-half years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and both the people and the president of the beleaguered nation have been fighting ever since. That was during Joe Biden’s presidency, however, and his 'as long as it takes' policy toward keeping American gear and tax dollars flowing into Ukraine. Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, and there has been plenty of speculation that he’ll turn off the tap. He has also said numerous times that he can end the war in a day. Lo and behold, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is now talking about peace and compromise with Russia. Zelensky Sues for Peace? In an interview with Sky News – his first significant sit-down with Western media since Trump won the White House – President Zelensky explained that he’s now considering a compromise to end the 'hot' war with Russia. 'If we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we need to take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control,' Zelensky told reporters. 'We need to do it fast. And then on the [occupied] territory of Ukraine, Ukraine can get them back in a diplomatic way.' Zelensky continued to advocate for Ukraine’s addition to NATO, but he admitted that it isn’t possible right now, under the current circumstances. To join the alliance, Ukraine would have to end the border dispute by officially ceding the Russian-held areas to Putin – something Ukraine’s constitution doesn’t allow. Still, Zelensky hopes for NATO protection for the parts of his nation not currently held by Russia. No NATO for Ukraine Putin has declared that Ukraine joining NATO would raise the threat of nuclear conflict, and western leaders fear that bringing Ukraine into the fold while its border is contested in an actual shooting war would drag the whole of the alliance into it as well – and then, quite possibly, the rest of the developed world. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty reads: 'The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered and attack against them all and consequently agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with other Parties, such actions as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.' In short: Attacking one member of NATO obligates the whole alliance to join the fight. What happens if the 32 other member nations, representing most of North America and Europe, all team up against Russia? Will that be the end of it, or will it officially become World War III when India, China, North Korea, Iran, and all the other Russian allies join in? And will it stay in Europe, or will it – like the last world war – span the globe as already tense situations in other areas get rolled into the larger conflict? If Ukraine’s leader is really willing to give up his dreams of retaking the lands captured by Russia and to – at least temporarily – stop trying to join NATO, there may actually be some ground both Zelensky and Putin can meet on to end the fighting. Losing territory yet again (recall that Russia successfully annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine during the Obama administration) would be a hard pill to swallow. But with the constant drip of dollars and weaponry from the Biden administration seemingly likely to dry up soon, Zelensky may have decided that it’s best to cut his losses before those losses include his entire country.

Debunking Putin’s New World Order – OpEd	During the tense months of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, the National Security Council’s Middle East expert Gary Sick was inundated daily with hundreds of pages of classified documents describing the rapidly evolving situation in Tehran. Yet the sources that Sick found most valuable in making sense of the crisis were neither the reports nor memos that the NSC staff helpfully supplied, but the direct speeches of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 'You could tell what these people were thinking […] [F]or intentions, you can’t do better than get a politician and let ‘em rant on for two hours.' Fortunately for analysts who take a cue from Sick to interpret the intentions of the Kremlin, the Russian president can 'rant on' for two hours—or four. Indeed, that’s how long Putin’s commentary ran during the November 7 meeting at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. An annual meeting of international scholars, world leaders, think tank experts, and journalists funded by pro-Kremlin NGOs, the Valdai forum is primarily aimed at shaping international perceptions of Russia. According to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s DisinfoWatch, Valdai’s purpose is to platform Russia’s geopolitical agenda while casting a scholarly glaze on pro-Kremlin talking points. This year, Putin spoke for one hour and took questions for three hours in an effort to contour the narrative about Russian intentions and activities on the world stage. Tellingly, the Russian president kicked off the event with praise for the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution which, like the French and English revolutions before it, had 'determined the course of history.' He then remarked that today’s citizens are 'destined' to see 'revolutionary changes' in their lifetimes as 'a completely new world order, nothing like we had in the past' is ushered in. The stakes, in other words, couldn’t be higher as Putin laid out his vision for the world to come. Yet it wasn’t a vision so much as instructions directed at both domestic and international audiences about how to understand Russia’s ideological struggle against Western nations. The independent news outlet Meduza reported that pro-Kremlin media organizations received guidelines from the Putin administration about how to cover the Valdai forum. The guidelines emphasized that the Russian president is a 'great world leader' and that his speech introduced the 'doctrine of a new world order.' Given their marching orders, Russian media outlets immediately got to work. The popular Lenta.ru ran the following headline: '‘The moment of truth is at hand.’ Putin spoke out about the formation of a new world order' while the more than century-old Izvestia chimed in with 'At the Valdai Club meeting, Putin declared the formation of a new world order.' As though a new geopolitical arrangement is something that can simply be announced into being—by Putin, no less. Although much of what was said at Valdai was familiar—grievances about NATO expansion, American duplicity, and Western hegemony—there was an unusual emphasis placed on a pseudo-philosophical framing of Russia’s relations with the West. Reminiscent of how he had treated the world to his lengthy amateur historicizing during the Tucker Carlson interview earlier this year, Putin is now legitimizing Russian aggression by means of lengthy amateur philosophizing. Characterizing his remarks as 'philosophical digressions,' the would-be philosopher-king dove headfirst into the 'dialectics of history.' As Putin related to his audience, the unforgiving 'course of history' is currently characterized by an 'irreconcilable struggle' informed not by a scramble for strategic predominance, but by ideology. The ideological combatants are, on one side, a hegemonic 'modern Western liberalism' that’s both 'racist' and 'globalist,' imposing 'totalitarian ideologies' in a 'crude colonial approach.' The belligerent hegemons bent on an 'ideological, military, and political monopoly' of the world include the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany (the 'collective West' for short). On the other side of the ideological divide, Putin identifies a somewhat vague but diverse 'global majority' that simply wants to be left alone to live in peace. Predictably, and without a trace of irony, Putin contends that Russia, China, and North Korea represent the world’s peace-loving nations. The Russian leader reminds his audience that, dialectically speaking, ideological contradictions are resolved via 'synthesis, transitioning to a new quality' which, practically speaking, means that the U.S.-led rules-based order will be invariably replaced with a regional and egalitarian arrangement in which 'all voices are heard.' Putin warns that the global domination by Western states, which are themselves engulfed in 'chaos, a systemic crisis,' is 'irreversibly passing away' because 'the course of history cannot be stopped.' This is not dialectical reasoning à la Hegel, for whom opposing forces are always reconcilable. Instead, it is evident that Marxist-Leninism is alive and well in the halls of the Kremlin, with the Russian leader praising, as his Soviet predecessors had done, the justice of a great ideological battle waged against imperialist powers on behalf of oppressed nations everywhere. In this Marxist-Leninist formulation, the West is perpetually on the brink of annihilation and its opponents need only strike while the iron is hot. Indeed, it was on the basis of Marxist theory that Lenin promised nearly a century ago that 'the epoch of capitalist imperialism is one of ripe and rotten-ripe capitalism, which is about to collapse.' Today, the bogeyman is no longer capitalism as such, but rather what Putin described at Valdai as the 'greed of those Western elites,' with 'elite' being today’s hip, populist term for 'bourgeois.' Indeed, it’s no coincidence that the military and economic cooperation among Russia, China, and North Korea mirrors that of the mid-twentieth century, when the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China worked together to bolster North Korea’s war against the U.S.-supported South—the first proxy conflict of the Cold War. Despite two world wars and the Great Depression, Western states didn’t collapse in the first half of the twentieth century and, considering America’s humming economy, aren’t poised to collapse any time soon. Putin’s intellectual sleight of hand relies on Valdai’s audience of 'experts' unquestioningly accepting his idiosyncratic version of history. On the one hand, the Russian leader coolly explains historical laws that cannot be altered, only observed. In this Hegelian conceptualization, Russia won’t need to aggressively confront the United States to establish multipolarity—the liberal world order will disintegrate on its own since 'any monopoly, as history teaches us, eventually comes to an end.' Remarking that the coming transformation 'is not even a fight for power or geopolitical influence,' Putin contends that the struggle against the West is entirely in the realm of ideas. On the other hand, however, Putin threatens kinetic action arising from the latter of two alternatives: either the West capitulates or there will be 'global catastrophe.' These are the sole possible outcomes because, as Putin said multiple times at Valdai, the collective West aims at the alleged 'strategic defeat of Russia' as evidenced by NATO expansion and economic sanctions against Russia. He then warned that the West’s crazed drive at nothing less than the total annihilation of the Russian nation risks 'mutual destruction' resulting from the use of nuclear forces and unspecified, technologically advanced weapons. Deploying his familiar tactic of studied ambiguity, evident in Russia’s revised nuclear doctrine and intended to sow public panic in the United States and its allies, Putin cautioned that 'nobody can guarantee that these weapons will not be used.' This is likely a reference to the hypersonic 'Oreshnik' missile that hit Dnipro exactly two weeks later. Here, the Russian president’s 'dialectical' logic reaches an impasse and betrays the Kremlin’s intentions: the global liberal order will collapse either because historical laws demand it or because Russian nuclear forces will blow it to smithereens. Put differently, history will be made one way or the other—and it will be made by the Kremlin. Of course, it was Lenin who had rejected Marx’s insistence on letting historical laws take their natural course, demonstrating that the movement of history can be hurried along with violence. The rival outcomes—Western collapse or Russia’s destruction—are phantoms of the Kremlin’s own making. But, despite Putin’s intellectual posturing, this is neither dialectic nor philosophy. It’s simply paranoia mixed with a strong dose of propaganda.

America’s Unprecedented Divisions Taint Holiday Season – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi A wave of targeted threats has disrupted the lives of key figures in President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration, as bomb scares and swatting hoaxes escalate tensions following a heated election season. The FBI has confirmed that several high-profile nominees and appointees have been deliberately targeted in a series of dangerous and politically charged incidents.Prominent cases include that of Lee Zeldin, the potential head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who received a pipe bomb threat accompanied by a politically motivated message. Meanwhile, the nominee for ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, was the focus of a swatting call — made to attract a police response to the target’s home — while she traveled for the holidays. Howard Lutnick, slated to be commerce secretary, received threats against his property in New York and former attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz’s home was the scene of a bomb squad response. The list also includes the incoming chief of staff, Susie Wiles.These events have raised alarm among the authorities, with the FBI working closely with local law enforcement agencies to investigate. The threats come amid heightened political tensions following a contentious election season, during which Trump survived two attempts on his life.President Joe Biden has condemned the incidents, stressing the importance of protecting individuals in public service from politically motivated violence. The escalation of such threats highlights the increasing risks political figures face in the current climate.Counterthreats have subsequently been directed at Democratic lawmakers. On Thanksgiving last week, multiple members of Congress in Connecticut became the targets of bomb threats, escalating the tense political climate in the country. Among those affected were Reps. Joe Courtney, Jahana Hayes, Jim Himes and John Larson. Authorities promptly responded to the threats at their homes and no explosives were found. Sen. Chris Murphy also faced a bomb scare at his residence, which was ultimately determined to be a hoax. Similarly, Rhode Island Rep. Seth Magaziner reported a swatting-style incident targeting his family.Notably, the messages accompanying the Democratic threats reportedly included references to 'MAGA,' heightening speculation about them being politically motivated retaliations.Americans today find themselves navigating an era of profound division, with political beliefs serving as both the catalyst and the battleground for an increasingly polarized society. These ideological divides permeate every aspect of public life, shaping debates on governance, cultural identity and the very definition of core national values.What was once a robust exchange of ideas has now devolved into entrenched partisanship, in which compromise is viewed as weakness and dialogue is too often replaced by confrontation.A recent Gallup poll illuminated Americans’ profound and growing perception that the nation is deeply divided on its fundamental values. This year, a record-high 80 percent of respondents reported feeling that the country is split on key principles, up from 77 percent in 2016. This sense of division has been steadily rising over the last two decades, with only 18 percent of Americans now believing the nation is united in its core values — a stark contrast to earlier periods in its history.The findings underscore a troubling trend in the American psyche, with division, rather than unity, becoming the defining characteristic of public sentiment. Notably, this was not always the case. In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a striking shift occurred, as more than two-thirds of Americans felt a sense of national solidarity. This was a rare moment when shared values and purpose seemed to transcend political and social divides. However, this unity was fleeting, as polarization returned and has since intensified.The Gallup poll captures the increasingly fractured landscape of American public opinion, shaped by various issues that have become lightning rods for discord — political ideologies, cultural debates, economic disparities and even differing views on what constitutes national identity. While these divisions have always existed to some degree, their current depth and persistence reflect a broader struggle to find common ground in a rapidly changing world.These findings have profound implications, not just for policymakers but for society at large. A nation perceived as divided risks undermining its ability to address pressing challenges effectively. A lack of trust and shared purpose can erode the democratic process, making it harder to enact meaningful change while weakening the country’s standing on the global stage.As the holiday season — a time traditionally marked by family reunions, goodwill and shared celebrations — unfolds, the US is grappling with a troubling narrative of division. This sacred season, which calls for reflection, understanding and unity, is being overshadowed by rhetoric that prioritizes political alienation over connection. Instead of fostering an environment that encourages families to bridge ideological divides, certain left-leaning media outlets have taken a different path, urging viewers and readers to boycott or distance themselves from family and friends who supported and voted for Trump.This approach not only deepens the divisions within families but also reflects a broader trend of demonizing dissent and discouraging constructive engagement. Political differences, while inevitable in a diverse democracy, should not overshadow the shared values that unite Americans. Family bonds, friendships and the human connections that underpin society must transcend partisanship to preserve the fabric of the nation. This schism is not merely a disagreement over policy, but also a reflection of deeper fractures in trust, perception and understanding between opposing camps. As the nation struggles to reconcile these differences, the challenge lies in rediscovering a shared commitment to unity without sacrificing the diversity of thought that is both a hallmark and a strength of American democracy.At a time when Americans face numerous challenges — ranging from economic uncertainty to global instability — the need for solidarity has never been greater.The holiday season offers a unique opportunity to pause, reflect and renew commitments to understanding one another, even in the face of disagreements. It is a call for all voices of influence — whether in media, politics or culture — to rise above division and embrace a message of reconciliation, urging Americans to rediscover the common humanity that binds them together.Only by prioritizing unity over discord can the nation move toward a more harmonious and hopeful future.

The Long War To Reaffirm Western And Israeli Primacy Undergoes A ...	The long war to reaffirm western and Israeli primacy is undergoing a shape-shift. On one front, the calculus in respect to Russia and the Ukraine war has shifted. And in the Middle East, the locus and shape of the war is shifting in a distinct way. Georges Kennan’s famed Soviet doctrine has long formed the baseline to U.S. policy, firstly directed toward the Soviet Union, and latterly, towards Russia. Kennan’s thesis from 1946 was that the United States needed to work patiently and resolutely to thwart the Soviet threat, and to enhance and aggravate the internal fissures in the Soviet system, until its contradictions triggered the collapse from within. More recently, the Atlantic Council has drawn on the Kennan doctrine to suggest that his broad outline should serve as the basis of U.S. policy towards Iran. 'The threat that Iran poses to the U.S. resembles the one faced from the Soviet Union after World War II. In this regard, the policy that George Kennan outlined for dealing with the Soviet Union has some applications for Iran', the Atlantic report states. Over the years, that doctrine has ossified into an entire network of security understandings, based on the archetypal conviction that America is strong, and that Russia was weak. Russia must ‘know that’, and thus, it was argued, there could be no logic for Russian strategists to imagine they had any other option but to submit to the overmatch represented by the combined military strength of NATO versus a ‘weak’ Russia. And should Russian strategists unwisely persevere with challenging the West, it was said, the inherent contrariety simply would cause Russia to fracture. American neocons and western intelligence have not listened to any other view, because they were (and largely still are) convinced by Kennan’s formulation. The American foreign policy class simply could not accept the possibility that such a core thesis was wrong. The entire approach reflected more a deep-seated culture, rather than any rational analysis – even when visible facts on the ground pointed them to a different reality. So, America has piled the pressure on Russia through the incremental delivery of additional weapons systems to Ukraine; through stationing intermediate range nuclear-capable missiles ever-closer to Russia’s borders; and most recently, by shooting ATACMS into ‘old Russia’. The aim has been to pressure Russia into a situation where it would feel obliged to make concessions to Ukraine, such as a to accept a freezing of the conflict, and to be obliged to negotiate against Ukrainian bargaining ‘cards’ devised to yield a solution acceptable to the U.S. Or, alternatively, for Russia to be cornered into the ‘nuclear corner’. American strategy ultimately rests on the conviction that the U.S. could engage in a nuclear war with Russia – and prevail; that Russia understands that were it to go nuclear, it would ‘lose the world’. Or, pressured by NATO, the anger amongst Russians likely would sweep Putin from office were he to make significant concessions to Ukraine. It was a ‘win-win’ outcome – from the U.S. perspective. Unexpectedly however, a new weapon appeared on the scene which precisely unshackles President Putin from the ‘all-or-nothing’ choice of having to concede a bargaining ‘hand’ to Ukraine, or resort to nuclear deterrence. Instead, the war can be settled by facts on the ground. Effectively, the George Kennan ‘trap’ imploded. The Oreshnik missile (that was used to attack the Yuzhmash complex at Dnietropetrovsk) provides Russia with a weapon, such as never before witnessed: An intermediate range missile system that effectively checkmates the western nuclear threat. Russia can now manage western escalation with a credible threat of retaliation that is both hugely destructive – yet conventional. It inverts the paradigm. It is now the West’s escalation that either has to go nuclear, or be limited to providing Ukraine with weapons such as ATACMS or Storm Shadow that will not alter the course of the war. Were NATO to escalate further, it risks an Oreshnik strike in retaliation, either in Ukraine or on some target in Europe, leaving the West with the dilemma of what to do next. Putin has warned: ‘If you strike again in Russia, we will respond with an Oreshnik hit on a military facility in another nation. We will provide warning, so that civilians can evacuate. There is nothing that you can do to prevent this; you do not have an anti-missile system that can stop an attack coming in at Mach 10’. The tables are turned. Of course, there are other reasons beyond the permanent security cadre’s wish to Gulliverise Trump into continuing the war in Ukraine, in order to taint him with a war that he promised immediately to end. Particularly the British, and others in Europe, want the war to continue, because they are on the financial hook from their holdings of some $20 billion Ukrainian bonds which are in a ‘default-like status’, or from their guarantees to the IMF for loans to Ukraine. Europe simply cannot afford the costs of a full default. Neither can Europe afford to pick up the burden, were the Trump Administration to walk away from supporting Ukraine financially. So they collude with the U.S. interagency structure to make the continuation of the war proofed against a Trump policy reversal: Europe for financial motives, and the Deep State because it wants to disrupt Trump, and his domestic agenda. The other wing to the ‘global war’ reflects a mirror paradox: That is, ‘Israel is strong and Iran is weak’. The central point is not only its cultural underpinning, but that the entire Israeli and U.S. apparatus is party to the narrative that Iran is a weak and technically backward country. The most significant aspect is the multi-year failure as regards factors such as the skill to understand strategies, and recognize changes in the other sides’ capabilities, views and understandings. Russia seems to have solved some of the general physical problems of objects flying at hypersonic speed. The use of new composite materials has made it possible to enable the gliding cruise bloc to make a long-distance guided flight practically in conditions of plasma formation. It flies to its target like a meteorite; like a ball of fire. The temperature on its surface reaches 1,600–2,000 degrees Celsius but the cruise bloc is reliably guided. And Iran seems to have solved the problems associated with an adversary enjoying air dominance. Iran has created a deterrence fashioned from the evolution of cheap swarms drones matched up with Ballistic missiles carrying precision hypersonic warheads. It puts $1,000 drones and cheap, precision missiles up and against hugely expensive piloted airframes – An inversion of warfare that has been twenty years in the making. The Israeli war however, is metamorphosing in other ways. The war in Gaza and Lebanon has strained Israeli manpower; the IDF have sustained heavy losses; its troops are exhausted; and the reservists are losing commitment to Israel’s wars, and are failing to show up for duty. Israel has reached the limits of its capacity to put boots on the ground (short of conscripting the Orthodox Haredi Yeshiva students – an act that could bring down the Coalition). In short, the Israeli army’s troop levels have fallen below present command ordered military commitments. The economy is imploding and internal divisions are raw and bruising. This is especially so due to the inequity of secular Israelis dying, whilst others stay exempt from military service – a destiny reserved for some but not others. This tension played a major part in Netanyahu’s decision to agree to a ceasefire in Lebanon. The growing animus about Orthodox Haredi exemption risked bringing down the Coalition. There are – metaphorically speaking – now two Israels: The Kingdom of Judea versus the State of Israel. In view of such deep antagonisms, many Israelis now see war with Iran as the catharsis that will bind a fractured people together again, and – if victorious – end all of Israel’s wars. Outside, the war widens and shape-shifts: Lebanon, for now, is put on a low flame burner, but Turkey has triggered a major military operation (reportedly some 15,000 strong) in an attack on Aleppo, using U.S. and Turkish trained jihadists and militia from Idlib. Turkish Intelligence no doubt has its own distinct objectives, but the U.S. and Israel have a particular interest to disrupt weapons supply routes to Hizbullah in Lebanon. The Israeli wanton onslaught on non-combatants, women and children – and its explicit ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population – has left the region (and the Global South) seething and radicalised. Israel, through its actions, is disrupting the old ethos. The region is ‘conservative’ no more. Rather, a very different ‘Awakening’ is gestating.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5qrlxG7vNvOO	2024-12-02T15:55:33-08:00	
Maritime Deal With China: Observers Unimpressed As Indonesian Min...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus Indonesia’s foreign minister on Monday responded to concerned lawmakers that a recent joint maritime development deal with China did not recognize Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea, but analysts said his explanations were a weak justification for a serious error. A joint statement issued after a meeting last month in Beijing between new Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Chinese President Xi Jinping said the two countries had reached an 'important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims.' However, Jakarta had consistently rejected China’s sweeping claims in the contested South China Sea, which encroaches into Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) north of the Natuna islands. During a parliamentary hearing on Monday, Indonesian legislator Sukamta said these Chinese claims, which are represented on its maps by a so-called nine-dash line, are changed by Beijing as it pleases. 'Previously it was nine dashes, now it’s 10,' said the legislator who goes by one name. 'We must be firm in asserting our rights. … Without clear boundaries, we risk being manipulated by China,' he said. Sukamta called for more clarity on the geographical scope of the development agreement mentioned in the text of the joint statement issued after Prabowo met with Xi. China’s claims in the South China Sea overlap those of five Asian nations and Taiwan. And in what many analysts back then saw as a political message, Jakarta in 2017 renamed the southern reaches of the South China Sea the North Natuna Sea to emphasize its sovereignty over those waters encompassing natural gas fields. Another Indonesian lawmaker, Farah Puteri Nahlia, echoed Sukamta’s concerns. 'We all understand that China is Indonesia’s key trading partner, but we should not become overly dependent,' Farah said. 'What steps will the foreign ministry take to ensure we maintain our non-aligned stance? We must aim for not only free trade but fair trade, while safeguarding our EEZ amidst these tensions.' Already, during the first week of Prabowo’s presidency in October, Indonesian naval and coast guard ships confronted and expelled a Chinese coast guard ship from its EEZ in the North Natuna Sea on three occasions. China has in recent years also opposed Indonesia’s oil and gas exploration activities in its EEZ. This agreement comes amid escalating tensions in the South China Sea region, a crucial maritime route for global commerce. ‘50% of nothing is still nothing’ Foreign Minister Sugiono responded to lawmakers’ concerns saying that the joint statement did not recognize China’s nine-dash line. 'The text itself is clear – it does not imply any such recognition,' Sugiono, who goes by one name, told lawmakers. 'The specifics, including the locations and terms of the cooperation, have not yet been defined. This is merely a preliminary agreement and the details will be worked out later.' He also said joint cooperation was President Prabowo’s plan 'as part of efforts to reduce tensions and maximize resource utilization,' and had been discussed with leaders of neighboring countries. 'The core principle is that President Prabowo has directed us to enhance cooperation with our neighboring countries for mutual benefit, while upholding Indonesia’s sovereignty,' Sugiono said. He said Indonesia’s position on sovereignty remained unchanged, noting that the joint development agreement would be guided by international law and Indonesia’s interests. 'Indonesia's stance remains unchanged, as do the positions of its neighbors. However, the principle stands: 50% of nothing is still nothing,' Sugiono further said. 'If there is no way to derive benefit from these resources for our nation's interests, it is better to collaborate while strictly adhering to fundamental principles and maintaining sovereignty.' ‘Little room for multiple interpretations’ For foreign policy analyst Mohamad Rosyidin, these explanations from Sugiono did not explain the crux of the problem – why the joint statement included the phrase 'overlapping claims.' 'The statement is merely an excuse for the blunder in the joint statement. It's unlikely the government will admit to that mistake,' Rosyidin, of Diponegoro University, told BenarNews. 'Just because we want to collaborate with China in the South China Sea doesn't mean Indonesia should shift from a rule-based approach to pragmatism.' The Indonesian government should remain consistent with the nation’s stance on the South China Sea, he said. 'The real problem is that Chinese vessels frequently enter Natuna waters. However, this does not mean there is an overlapping claim; it is a violation of sovereignty by China.' Another international relations analyst, Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, concurred. 'I am among those who believe there is little room for multiple interpretations of the joint statement between President Prabowo and President Xi Jinping regarding overlapping claims,' he told BenarNews. 'Regardless of how it is responded to or justified, I see the initial phrasing in the agreement as a concession by Indonesia, yielding or compromising with China.' He said the problematic text could have an effect on Indonesia, if not immediately then in the near future. 'Whether intentional or not is a secondary matter. Intentional or not, there will be impacts on Indonesia’s sovereign rights. … especially if there are no serious efforts for reversal through follow-up measures or statements,' he said. Such a concession may ease any tensions between Indonesia and China, but it strengthens Beijing’s hand and gives the impression Jakarta is yielding to the major power, he said. 'Currently, the foreign minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are in damage-control mode. The potential for conflict and unilateral claims are two sides of the same coin,' he said. 'The only positive aspect is that the initiative has not yet materialized, as mentioned by the foreign minister.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5njMTn9BMub5	2024-12-02T15:52:24-08:00	
NATO Rejects Pristina’s Request For Kosovar Deployment To North	(RFE/RL) -- NATO's mission in Kosovo says it has withheld authorization for a request by Pristina to deploy the ethnically fractured country's national security body, the Kosovo Security Force (KSF), to the Serb-majority northern region where an explosion last week damaged a water canal and ratcheted up tensions. Kosovar officials have accused neighboring Serbia of involvement, without providing evidence -- a charge Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic rejected before vowing to conduct an investigation and hinting cryptically, 'We have information about who might be the perpetrator.'NATO's KFOR mission confirmed to RFE/RL's Kosovo Service on December 1 that Kosovar authorities had asked to deploy the KSF to the northern area of Zubin Potok, a region where the transatlantic alliance and European civilian mission EULEX have helped keep the peace for years.'The KFOR Commander has not given such authorization, based on his security assessment and the actions already undertaken by KFOR,' the NATO force said in a written response.Serbia rejects independence for its former province, and decade-old talks facilitated by the European Union to normalize relations between Pristina and Belgrade have largely stalled.Belgrade has long maintained parallel institutions in northern Kosovo that serve the tens of thousands of Serbs there who mostly reject Kosovar central authority.Pristina has essentially pledged since a 2013 agreement not to deploy its mostly ethnically Albanian forces to the northern region without KFOR's prior consent.Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti called the November 29 blast that damaged the canal supplying water to his country's two main coal power plants a 'criminal and terrorist attack' by northern neighbor and bitter rival Serbia.The attack did not cause any casualties but threatened power disruption as the region hunkers down for the onset of winter.Drinking water supplies to Pristina were also said to be at risk. 'KFOR has deployed units to secure the Zobin Potok area of the damaged water canal,' KFOR told RFE/RL. 'KFOR has also offered additional assistance to the Institutions in Kosovo, including logistical and explosive ordnance disposal support.'It said it was in contact with all key partners and was monitoring events.At a press conference late on December 1, Kurti avoided saying whether he had sought KFOR permission for a deployment but acknowledged Pristina was 'constrained' by the 2013 deal. The next day, Kurti invited foreign envoys for a meeting to discuss the situation. Afterward, U.S. Ambassador to Pristina Jeffrey Hovenier said Washington doesn't know who was behind the attack. But, he added, 'Once it is...determined who is responsible, we will work with the proper authorities to ensure that they are held accountable.'Kurti, whose ruling Self-Determination Movement (Vetëvendosje) is facing national elections next year, has spent much of the past year squeezing out dinar payments, Serbian postal and banking ties, and other Serbian-dominated aspects of everyday life in northern Kosovo.EU and U.S. officials have repeatedly warned his government to refrain from unilateral and potentially provocative steps.The explosion in the village of Varrage, in the Zubin Potok municipality, created a large crack in the Iber-Lepenc canal.The waterway, which originates at Ujman (Gazivoda) Lake, supplies water to the entire northern region of Kosovo, the Mitrovica regions, and Pristina and its surroundings, including the Kosovo Energy Corporation for cooling its power plants.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5szy4Mi_i3JL	2024-12-02T15:51:23-08:00	
The Carbon Soil Opportunity: Organic Farming Helps Counter Climat...	Switching to organic products is an easy way to eat healthier and support the environment. Climate change is no longer an abstraction. I can literally see it at my front door. My figs ripened in October 2024, which has never happened before as it was never warm enough during that month. In my home state of Oregon, wildfires set new records this year, with almost 2 million acres burned. Meanwhile, in my hometown, Eugene, we had the longest stretch of consecutive days when temperatures reached at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. It's hard for me to think about the world that I will leave to my grandchildren. So I look for what I can do, and believe it or not, there's hope right at the grocery store; buying organic can contribute to combating climate change. Organic farmers actually store carbon in the soil, meaning there's less in the air to change our climate. A series of long-term studies mentioned below demonstrate that organic farming increases soil carbon. In other words, organic farming is carbon farming. Federal law defines organic farming as a farming method, so we know what we're buying. Organic farmers use cover crops, mulches, and crop rotations to build healthy soil. They utilize various techniques to prevent pest problems, using only certain pesticides, which have been thoroughly reviewed as a last resort. You can support carbon farming by buying organic. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2023 Synthesis Report states that carbon sequestration in agriculture has one of the highest potentials for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon sequestration, or carbon farming, uses farming techniques to increase soil carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere (For more details about carbon farming and farmers who are using the method, see 'How Land Use Is a Tool for Solving Climate Change' and 'Carbon Farming: A Sustainable Agriculture Technique That Keeps Soil Healthy and Combats Climate Change.') Referring to the IPCC recommendations, the World Economic Forum's November 2024 article states, '[E]nhancing soil carbon sequestration through regenerative agriculture could sequester up to 23 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050, a substantial portion of the mitigation required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.' Studies on Organic Farming and Soil Carbon—the Big Picture Organic carbon farming has been documented by scientists for decades. In 2012, researchers from Switzerland, Scotland, and Italy published a meta-analysis of 74 studies that were pairwise comparisons of organic and conventional farms growing various crops around the world—from all continents except for Africa and Antarctica. The researchers measured soil carbon in three ways (if the underlying study provided the necessary data): the soil carbon concentration, the amount of soil carbon per unit area, and the rate at which the soil carbon measurements changed. They found that for all three measurements, soil carbon was greater at the organic farms than conventional farms. They concluded that 'organic farming has the potential to accumulate soil carbon.' Meanwhile, a 2017 study by Northeastern University and the Organic Center—which studied more than 1,000 soil samples from both organic and conventional farms across 48 states in the U.S.—'found that organic soils had 13 percent higher soil organic matter and 44 percent higher long-term carbon storage than conventionally managed soils.' Crops That May Be on Your Grocery List Eating organic fruits and vegetables is better for the environment and has overall health benefits. 'Not only does organic production help reduce public health risks, mounting evidence shows that food grown organically are rich in nutrients, such as Vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, with less exposure to nitrates and pesticide residues in organically grown fruits, vegetables, and grains when compared to conventionally grown products,' states the Organic Trade Association. Below is a list of popular items we regularly purchase from grocery stores. I chose these products because they are foods that most of us buy often. For each food, There is at least one study showing that choosing organic can help support carbon sequestration and, therefore, allows us to play our part in combating climate change: Corn A 2015 review article examined six long-term organic and conventional corn farming comparisons. Each study involved one site, with some plots managed organically and others managed conventionally. Four studies were done in the Midwest, one in California, and one in Maryland. All the studies grew corn in rotation with other crops. The studies were initiated between 1981 and 1998, and these plots had been continuously used for farming between 10 and 24 years when soil carbon was measured. In five of the six studies, soil carbon capture increased in instances of organic treatments compared to conventional treatments. (The one exception was a plot that used to be a dairy farm and had high soil carbon levels at the beginning of the study.) The review article concludes, 'These results suggest that organic farming practices have the potential to reduce nitrate leaching, foster carbon sequestration, and allow farmers to remain competitive in the marketplace.' Wheat An 11-year comparison of organic and conventional wheat farming (with other crops grown in rotation) in Nebraska found that soil organic matter (one way to measure carbon) was higher in the organic plots than in conventional plots. Tomato (in rotation with corn) California's Century Experiment has compared organic and conventional tomato (and corn) farming since 1993. Measurements of soil organic carbon showed that the concentrations in organic plots were two to three times higher than in the conventional plots. The study authors noted that the increases occurred throughout the soil profile, down to a depth of 6 feet. Potato (in rotation with wheat and corn) A long-term field study in Switzerland that compared organic and conventional farming systems showed that soil organic carbon was higher in the organic plots. The researchers collected soil samples over two decades after the experiment started. A study in Germany found that while carbon was sequestered in the organic plots for more than 15 years, in the conventional plots, the soil lost carbon. Almonds In 2018 and 2019, researchers in California compared eight conventional almond orchards with eight organic orchards. (The researchers identified the organic orchards as 'regenerative,' but all were certified organic.) The trees in the orchards had been growing for between three and 38 years. Total soil carbon was about 30 percent greater in organic orchards than in conventional orchards. The researchers concluded: 'Our results support the notion that converting agriculture to regenerative systems could contribute to remediating several imminent global problems, including climate change diminishing water resources, biodiversity loss, agricultural pollution, human health problems, and diminishing rural economies.' Strawberries (in rotation with broccoli and lettuce) In 2004 and 2005, researchers, mainly from Washington State University, compared 13 pairs of organic and conventional strawberry farms in Watsonville, California. The farms had been either organic or conventional for at least five years. They found that the amount of carbon in the soil from organic farms was higher than 21 percent compared to conventional farms. Apples Scientists from Washington State University and the United States Agency for International Development compared conventional and organic apple production in a commercial orchard in the Yakima Valley. Trees were planted in 1994, and soil measurements were taken in 1998. At that time, soil organic carbon in the organic plots was about 15 percent higher than in the conventional plots. Citrus Two studies, one from Brazil and the other from Italy, showed that total organic soil carbon was higher in organic citrus orchards than in conventional orchards. The increase in soil carbon was 30 percent in the Italian study and 300 percent in some Brazilian measurements. Extra Benefits Organic farming benefits people who grow and harvest food because they are exposed to fewer pesticides. According to a 2024 study from California, researchers looked for seven common herbicides and two fungicides in carpet dust from homes in the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. The frequency at which each pesticide was detected and its amount increased in homes where larger amounts of pesticides were used nearby. None of these pesticides are used on organic farms. 'Our findings suggest that most of these herbicides and fungicides travel from the field via primary and secondary drift to homes in the surrounding area, potentially impacting the health of children and other vulnerable groups,' the study published in Environmental International states. Organic farming also benefits those of us who eat the food. In 2024, Consumer Reports (CR) analyzed pesticide contamination of 59 common fruits and vegetables. The data came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, spanning seven years, and included both conventional and organic produce. The analysis by CR found that pesticide contamination posed significant risks in 20 percent of conventional foods but in almost none of the organic foods. Eating more organic produce ensures a healthier diet. Tackling a Global Problem With Personal Choices Climate change is an enormous and complex problem, and the solutions are also complex. There's no single silver bullet that can fix the crisis, including carbon farming. Even its proponents state that converting power generation to solar or wind energy and reducing the destruction of natural ecosystems are more significant measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, while organic food is sometimes hard to find and more expensive, it is a relatively simple step that many of us can incorporate into our daily lives, providing a crucial opportunity to help mitigate climate change.

By Mariama Diallo After promising to visit Africa two years ago at the U.S. Africa summit in Washington, President Joe Biden makes his first presidential trip to the continent where he is visiting Angola with a quick stop in Cabo Verde. Analysts in Africa say the trip should’ve come sooner and some are asking why Angola is the primary destination – given its troubling human rights record. White House officials say President Joe Biden is looking forward to visiting the continent after a promise he made in 2022. But some analysts tell VOA that Biden’s trip, which comes weeks before he steps down, would’ve had more weight if he had done it earlier. Louw Nel, senior political analyst for Oxford Economics Africa, spoke to VOA from South Africa. 'I think his trip is less significant than it would’ve been otherwise just because of the fact that he withdrew as presidential candidate and, of course, now [is] not returning for a second term. So, it really feels like an afterthought to his presidency,' said Nel. After a short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde off Africa’s northwestern coast, President Biden heads south to Angola. There, officials say he plans to focus on U.S. leadership on trade, investment, and infrastructure in Africa. He’ll also recognize Angola’s President João Lourenço’s regional leadership and global partnership on trade, security, and health. More importantly, President Biden will highlight one of his signature initiatives, the investment of the Lobito Corridor — a regional railway project linking natural resource-rich areas stretching from the Angolan port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The corridor is part of a wider joint effort between multiple partners aimed at closing the infrastructure gap in growing economies around the world, officials say. Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking about the broader benefits associated with the project. 'What I found really notable about the Lobito Corridor is that it isn’t just about a railroad or critical minerals. It’s also about the communities that are strengthened along the way, it’s about more access to education, it’s about agricultural products moving to market, and it’s about increases in digital connectivity,' said Brown. Last year, U.S.-Angola trade totaled approximately $1.77 billion, making Angola America’s fourth-largest trade partner in Sub-Saharan Africa. Angola has vast mineral deposits and is Africa’s third largest oil producer. But according to Amnesty International, the country’s natural resource wealth has not translated to prosperity for most of its people, resulting in numerous peaceful protests against poverty, unemployment and high cost of living. Nel says some Angolans may see a benefit with this Biden visit. 'Many ordinary Angolans will recognize that Angola desperately needs to diversify its economy, and this is an enormous opportunity to do so, to move away from oil and gas and bolster other parts of the economy and it has massive potential,' said Nel. But others including human rights campaigners and opposition parties, Nel says, will feel aggrieved by President Biden’s visit because they see the Lourenco administration as being rewarded despite growing concerns about the shrinking space for independent civil society organizations and freedom of expression. In a new report, Amnesty International said that anyone who publicly criticizes the Lourenço government risks arrest. And 'if human rights are central to President Biden’s foreign policy, then he must demand Angola’s government immediately …free arbitrarily detained government critics.' Adriano Nuvunga, who runs the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, echoes that sentiment. 'I commend the people of Angola and president Lourenço for hosting President Biden. It means a lot for the people of Angola. While I commend them, I would also want to encourage President Biden to ask those tough questions to President João Lourenço,' said Nuvunga. 'We have a number of human rights defenders in Angola that are detained unjustly, unfairly for doing nothing. They are languishing in jails, some of them in critical conditions,' said Nuvunga. Nuvunga hopes that this could be addressed during this trip.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5kLVxs5HAIk-	2024-12-02T15:44:11-08:00	
Pakistan: TTP Mercenary Terror – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya As reported on November 25, 2024, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) threatened to begin attacking Chinese Belt and Road development projects unless the government paid them a 5 per cent tax on the construction. In a video message, the 'commander' of the Taliban's Gandapur faction warned that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project would be destroyed. 'Five per cent is our tax everywhere,' the 'commander' declared in an address to construction workers in Dera Ismail Khan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). 'Machinery and staff will be targeted' by Taliban fighters if the taxes are not paid, he added. As reported on November 19, Shahzaib, a resident of Charsadda District had received a text on TTP's letterhead in October (date not specified), and paid up a reduced amount of the USD 50,000 the militants initially demanded, after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. On October 25, 2024, the guesthouse of a former Senator, Saleh Shah, located in South Waziristan District's Tiarza tehsil (revenue unit), was completely levelled in a blast after 'unidentified attackers' reportedly planted explosives at the residence. Shah told Police that he had been receiving extortion calls from unknown people who had been threatening him and his family with 'dire consequences'. As reported on September 7, Dr. Muhammad Yousuf from Shaukat Khanum Hospital was abducted from the Bhatta Khusht Bazar in the Achini Road area of Peshawar, and a ransom of PKR 50 million was demanded, before he was finally recovered by the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) and Police from the Khyber tribal District after ten days in captivity. On August 28, 2024, Lieutenant Colonel Khalid Amir and three of his relatives were kidnapped by TTP from the Kalach area of Dera Ismail Khan District. Later, in September, they were released following a ransom payment and the release of some TTP cadres in detention. A September 30, 2024, report indicated that, during 2024, 98 cases of extortion were reported in KP. The President of the KP Chamber of Commerce, Fawad Ishaq, stated, 'No one is willing to invest here due to the risk of extortion and terrorism. In recent times, 10 out of 12 textile mills in KP have been closed due to extortion, while about a hundred manufacturers have shifted their business abroad to countries like the USA, UK, Vietnam, Malaysia, UAE and Turkey. Similarly, around 800 small units in the province have also been closed due to the law and order situation… ' As reported on November, 19, the southern districts of KP have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcement personnel. In the evening, militants are seen watching the streets and setting up checkpoints in the Districts of Tank, Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, and North and South Waziristan. While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well off people in other Districts of the province regularly get threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from TTP - with demands to pay or face attacks. Apart from extortion, the terrorists are also involved in generating funds through narcotics trafficking. TTP, in particular, benefits from this illicit trade, using drug money to finance terrorist operations. The Taliban's rule in Afghanistan has further bolstered the TTP, with drug trafficking acting as a lifeline for both groups. As reported on October 2, 2024, TTP and Lashkar-i-Islam continue to make their presence felt in parts of Tirah Valley as they have started asking the leading local narcotics dealers for a 'share' in their earnings from the recently harvested cannabis crop. Earlier, as reported on July 28, 2024, TTP generated 'revenue' from the Khyber District, extorting as much as 20 per cent to 30 per cent from major drug producers or dealers in the District. TTP imposed a tax of PKR 5,000 on every kilogramme of hashish (cannabis) produced/trafficked through the District. Also, as reported on August 10, 2024, Pakistan Taliban terrorists have engaged in robbing of bank vehicles carrying cash. A disturbing connection has emerged between these acts of violence and financial networks that funnel money to terrorist factions operating in Afghanistan, through hawala and hundi (illegal money laundering channels) in the provinces of Laghman and Khost. Several incidents of robbery of bank vehicles have been reported in Dera Ismail Khan District: on August 8, 2024, PKR 8.8 million was looted from a bank cash van; PKR 40 million on July 30; and PKR eight million on July 8. A September 10 report indicated that TTP was currently active in 10 of KP's 34 districts. In the North Waziristan District, TTP fighters force locals to feed them, and extort businessmen and wealthy landowners. July 2024 reports stated that contractors working on government-sponsored projects in North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, Bajaur, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, and Mohmand were believed to be paying anywhere from 5 per cent to 15 per cent to TTP. Earlier on July 22, 2024, in a jirga (tribal council) of the elders of Bannu District, it was demanded that all centres of surrendered Taliban be ended permanently, as well as the elimination of 'patrolling/ picketing by Taliban forthwith', because Taliban's patrolling, extortion of money and checking of documents undermined the writ of the Pakistani state, strengthening the impression that the government was either unwilling or incapable of protecting citizens from the terrorists. Nevertheless, the situation in KP continues to deteriorate rapidly. The social and financial disruption caused by TTP terrorists in the province is a clear indication of a bleak future, showcasing the failures of the Pakistani state. Moreover, with constant support from the Afghan Taliban, and a fighting force of an estimated 6,000-6,500 TTP fighters sheltering in Afghanistan, the group is a severe threat to the administration. The TTP, moreover, has a maximalist agenda, seeking to overthrow the existing government in order to establish an Islamic Emirate of Pakistan. The ideology that Pakistan has long promoted has now boomeranged, threatening the very existence of the state itself.

India: PLFI Residual Nuisance – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On November 24, 2024, two youths, identified as Ravi Tanti (22) and Ghansa Topno, were killed by suspected cadres of the People's Liberation Front of India (PLFI), a splinter group of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), in Giru village under the Gudri subdivision in West Singhbhum District, Jharkhand. A Naxalite [Left Wing extremist, LWE] poster found on a tree at the village square, called for a halt to sand extraction from Peding in Gudri to Serengda in Goilkera. While confirming the contents of the poster, the Police were probing its connection to the killings. Another two other persons were abducted by PLFI cadres from the village, Police said. Earlier, on March 18, 2024, Matiyas aka Mangra Tuti (25), a PLFI supporter, was shot dead allegedly by its cadres in a weekly market in Gundri village under Anandpur Police Station limits in West Singhbhum District. Matiyas was a former cadre who had eight criminal cases registered against him and had been jailed. He was released from prison a couple of months earlier. He had come to the haat (weekly market) in Gundri village, when he was shot dead over a money-related dispute, the police disclosed. PLFI received a major shock following the arrest of Dinesh Gope aka Kuldeep Yadav aka Badku (51), the PLFI 'supremo', and its disruptive activities had almost come to a halt. Gope was arrested in a joint operation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Jharkhand Police in New Delhi on May 21, 2023. However, the recent incidents indicate that PLFI cadres are again pushing hard to make their presence felt in their erstwhile areas of activity. According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), three PLFI-linked fatalities (all civilians) have been recorded in 2024, thus far (data till December 1). During the corresponding period of 2023, two fatalities (one civilian and one PLFI cadre) were recorded, while no further PLFI-linked fatalities were registered in the remaining period of 2023. A maximum of 30 PLFI-linked fatalities (14 civilians and 16 PLFI cadres) were recorded in 2016. PLFI-linked fatalities have subsequently followed a cyclical trend, dropping to 21 fatalities (eight civilians, two SFs and 11 PLFI cadres) in 2017, and further fell to nine (five civilians and four PLFI cadres) in 2018. The fatalities spiked to 12 (two civilians and 10 PLFI cadres) in 2019 and then declined to 10 (one civilian and nine PLFI cadres) in 2020. There were two fatalities (both PLFI cadres) in 2021, one (PLFI cadre) in 2022, two (one civilian and one PLFI cadre) in 2023 and three (all civilians) in 2024 (data till December 1). Significantly, since July 2007, when PLFI was formed, a total of 225 fatalities, including 115 civilians, seven SF personnel and 103 PLFI cadres, have been documented. Analysis of other crucial parameters suggest that the PLFI's operational capacities have suffered severely over the past few years due to an SF crackdown against the outfit in the state. Indeed, no major incidents (each resulting in three or more fatalities) involving the PLFI has been reported in 2023 and 2024. The last such incident was recorded on May 28, 2020, when three PLFI cadres, including a woman, were killed, while a fourth was injured in an exchange of fire with SFs in the Tabo Valley of the Manmandubera Forest area under Tabo Police Station limits in the West Singhbhum District. Further, no incident of explosion has been carried out by the group in 2024, as, indeed, in the previous seven years. The last such incident was recorded on October 16, 2016, when suspected PLFI cadres blew up two concrete sleepers on railway tracks, detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) between Khelari and McCluskieganj stations in Ranchi District. However, PLFI's petty criminal and disruptive activities persist. Taking action against PLFI, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) also sped up cases related to the group. The NIA chargesheeted four accused in two cases, and also conducted raids on premises of suspects who had links with PLFI. On October 5, 2024, the NIA chargesheeted Kapil Pathak aka Rana Singh aka Arjun Rana aka Pandit Ji of district Dhemaji, Assam, and Binod Munda aka Sukhu aka Dahura of Khunti, Jharkhand, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), in a case related to the revival and strengthening of PLFI in Jharkhand and neighbouring states. NIA had registered the case RC-04/2023/NIA/RNC suo motu in October 2023 in connection with the involvement of PLFI cadres in generating funds through extortion from various coal traders, transporters, railway contractors, businessmen, etc., in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha. These members of PLFI had also conspired to commit various terrorist activities, including murder, arson and violent attacks, to create terror, especially among businessmen and contractors. During investigation, NIA had also recovered a country-made rifle, a country-made pistol, 57 rounds of 7.62 MM prohibited ammunition and 20 rounds of .315 (8mm), from Binod Munda. The arms and ammunition had been supplied by Kapil Pathak, investigations had revealed. On June 11, 2024, NIA filed a chargesheet against Nivesh Kumar aka Nivesh Poddar, and Raman Kumar Sonu aka Sonu Pandit, in the case of strengthening the PLFI. Further, on August 7, 2024, the NIA conducted searches at two locations in the Khunti district of Jharkhand in a PLFI extortion and terrorism racket. Premises of suspects with links to PLFI were searched by NIA teams, and several incriminating digital devices and documents were seized. The case, RC-04/2023/NIA/RNC, related to extortion from various coal traders, transporters, railway contractors, businessmen, etc., by PLFI cadres in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These cadres had also conspired to commit various terrorist acts, including murder, arson and violent attacks. Additionally, on April 10, 2024, the NIA arrested an armed PLFI cadre, following raids at two locations each in Jharkhand and Assam. The crackdown led to the arrest of Binod Munda aka Sukkhwa from the Khunti District of Jharkhand. The accused was wanted in four PLFI cases in Jharkhand and has been arrested in a case relating to revival attempts by PLFI. As part of their revival activities, PLFI cadres had been involved in generating funds through extortion from various coal traders, transporters, railway contractors, and businessmen in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. NIA teams seized incriminating material, including PLFI-related documents, two walkie-talkies, five mobile phones, SIM cards and INR 11,000 cash, during the searches. SFs conducting raids in the state have arrested at least four PLFI cadres since the beginning of the current year, according to the SATP database (data till December 1, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, 32 PLFI cadres had been arrested. A total of 34 PLFI cadres were arrested through 2023. Since July 2007, when PLFI was formed, at least 768 PLFI cadres have been arrested. Mounting SF pressure has also led to in the surrender of 32 PLFI cadres since July 2007, though not a single surrender has been recorded in 2024 yet; the last surrender was recorded on March 11, 2018. Concerns persist as some of the leadership elements are still on the Jharkhand Police rewarded Naxal list Martin Kerketta, 'regional commander,' with a head bounty of INR 1.5 million; Balram Lohra aka Jatu aka Majnu, and Krishna Yadav aka Toofan ji aka Sultan Munda, 'area commanders,' carrying head bounties of INR 200,000 each; and Samuel Budh aka Samu, a Local Guerilla Squad (LGS) member, carrying head bounty of INR 100,000, have managed to evade the Police dragnet till now. PLFI has certainly lost its sway in erstwhile areas of dominance, especially after the arrest of Dinesh Gope, but retain some disruptive capacities, visible in incidents of violence perpetrated against civilians. The residual leadership elements that continue to evade the police remain a threat to public security, and a nuisance for the state.

Spanish Socialists Unite Behind Sánchez To ‘Resist’ Right, Far-Ri...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- The Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE/S&D) showed its determination to 'resist' in the face of renewed right-wing and far-right attacks against Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who was re-elected leader of the progressive party by a large majority at a party meeting in Seville. Sánchez's PSOE closed its 41st federal congress with a strong message of unity following the repeated attacks on Sánchez by the main opposition force and the third-largest force in parliament, Partido Popular (EPP) and the far-right Vox (Patriots for Europe). Speaking at the opening of the party conference, Sánchez was optimistic about his term in office, which will end in 2027 unless early elections are called. 'The best is yet to come. We have to keep moving forward, out of responsibility and out of hope. FOR THE LEFT', the Spanish prime minister said on Saturday. Despite Sanchez's optimism, the left-wing government faces a serious obstacle to maintaining its precarious stability: it must convince the right-wing Catalan separatist JxCatparty of former regional president Carles Puigdemont, to vote in favour of the 2025 national budget, among other challenges related to the issue of Catalonia. In a speech on Saturday, Spanish Finance Minister María Jesús Montero slammed the right-wing camp and Vox for their aggressive stance against the Spanish prime minister. 'We are going to come out of this congress new, committed, reinforced, as always. And we are going to stop this right-wing and far-right in their sexist, xenophobic discourse, (and their) de-legitimation of politics,' Montero stressed. Sánchez, a leader with extreme political endurance Sánchez, who was ousted by some of his party colleagues - seen as the more orthodox 'old guard' - in October 2017, returned to the post of PSOE secretary general just eight months after winning militants' support in an internal vote. The head of government, who recently wrote an autobiographical book describing himself as a 'resister,' was re-elected leader of his party on Sunday by the majority of its members (90%). A PSOE source told EFE that the party's congress was marked by one word: 'resistance' against reactionary forces (Partido Popular, Vox). Sánchez's defiance contrasted with the harsh words of Partido Popular leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo, who - ironically alluding to Sánchez's 'resilience' - warned him on Sunday that the PSOE would eventually be defeated. 'Hold on, Pedro, don't resign because you don't deserve to leave with a minimum of honour; we are going to kick you out the Spaniards freely and democratically,' said the right-wing leader. The PSOE currently has around 153,000 card-carrying members, in addition to thousands of supporters who are not formal party members. The progressive formation has 120 MPs in the national parliament and 20 MEPs in Strasbourg. In a show of unity and to maintain the party's strategic continuity in the face of the right-wing camp, the PSOE revalidated the 'hard core' of the formation, including Montero-Sánchez's right-hand man and Santos Cerdán, the party's organisational secretary, while retaining many of the current ministers. Stopping reactionary forces The PSOE, which governs in coalition with the left-wing Sumar platform, has been the target of harsh criticism from the PP and Vox, particularly since the entry into force of a controversial amnesty law pardoning several Catalan separatist leaders, including Puigdemont, who is currently in self-imposed exile in Belgium. Sánchez has also been the subject of fierce political attacks from both right-wing parties over an ongoing investigation into the prime minister's wife, Begoña Gómez, for alleged corruption and influence peddling. The case, led by the civil servants' union Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), linked to the extreme right in the Iberian country, prompted Sánchez to consider resigning at the end of April. Another sensitive dossier affecting the Spanish prime minister is the so-called ‘Koldo case’, a corruption affair involving millions in illegal commissions for the purchase of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, which directly implicates former transport minister José Luis Ábalos (PSOE), Sanchez's former collaborator. Adding to the controversy surrounding the left-wing party, last week, the leader of the PSOE in the Madrid region, Juan Lobato, resigned following the revelation of confidential information relating to a tax fraud case involving the boyfriend of the controversial president of the Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso (Partido Popular).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5ipZhy_LzYj7	2024-12-02T15:35:38-08:00	
China Slams Lithuania Over Expulsions Amid Cable-Cutting Row	By He Ping China on Monday slammed Lithuania’s expulsion of three of its nationals amid an ongoing row over the involvement of a Chinese-registered cargo vessel in the cutting of undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea. The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday declared three staff members of China’s representative office in the country, a type of diplomatic mission, as personae non gratae, citing alleged violations of the Vienna Convention outlining diplomatic law and Lithuanian legislation, and ordered them to leave the country within a week. Calling the move 'brutal and provocative behavior,' China’s foreign ministry said Vilnius had previously expressed a desire to improve ties with Beijing, and expressed 'strong condemnation.' The spat comes after questions were raised over the activities of a Chinese ship that was spotted near two undersea internet cables that were cut in the Baltic Sea on Nov. 17 and 18. While European officials haven’t made details of their investigations public, one of the undersea cables that was cut runs between Sweden and Lithuania. Social media users spotted the Chinese ship slightly slowing down and altering course as it crossed the 730-mile C-Lion 1 undersea cable connecting Finland and Germany and the 130-mile link between Sweden and Lithuania around the time that they were cut. Several media reports said the authorities in Sweden and Finland are investigating the suspected sabotage of two undersea fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea, with attention focusing on a Chinese-registered cargo ship, the Yi Peng 3. The ship was still anchored off Denmark on Monday, in close proximity to the German patrol vessel Bamberg, according to MarineTraffic.com. Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning had said on Friday that Beijing was 'willing to cooperate ... to find out the truth' of the allegations. But China hit out at Lithuania’s move on Monday. 'China hopes that the new Lithuanian government will take concrete actions to abide by the political commitments made in the communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, adhere to the one-China principle, and push bilateral relations back on track,' foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Monday. The state-run Global Times newspaper said Lithuania has already angered Beijing by switching ties in 2021 to democratic Taiwan, which China claims as 'an inalienable part' of its territory. 'Three years on since the downgrade of bilateral ties with China, Lithuania has again taken detrimental action that further exacerbates the relations,' the paper said in an editorial. 'China calls on Lithuania to immediately stop undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stop creating difficulty for bilateral relations,' China reserves the right to take countermeasures against Lithuania, it quoted the country’s foreign ministry as saying.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5g2fw6otf74g	2024-12-02T15:33:54-08:00

Robert Reich: Wikler For DNC Chair – OpEd	Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman, announced he was entering the race to lead the Democratic National Committee. This is important. The person who runs the DNC is the key organizer for the Democratic Party between now, the 2026 midterms, and the 2028 presidential election (assuming we have one). That person will be a critical voice in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian fascism. Speaking on CNN’s 'Inside Politics,' Wikler said, 'I’m running for chair of the Democratic National Committee because we need to unite, we need to fight, and we need to win to stop the GOP from ripping this country apart and ripping off working people to enrich mega billionaires.' Wikler is the right man for the job. I got to know Ben when he proved to be a thoughtful and effective top official at MoveOn. He’s chaired the Wisconsin Democrats since 2019, presiding over the successful rebuilding of a party that had been seriously weakened by many years of Republican control of the state government. Wikler organized and mobilized voters in a state that Republicans had rigged to ensure total dominance and control. Ben unrigged that system. He turned Wisconsin into a year-round organizing and fundraising powerhouse, winning seven of the last 10 statewide elections since he took over. Democrats just picked up four congressional seats in Wisconsin. They held on to their Senate seat. They also broke the GOP supermajority in the state Senate, picked up 10 seats in the state Assembly, and are on track to flip both chambers in 2026 and potentially get a trifecta if they win the governor’s race that year too. This was made possible in part because Democrats flipped Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court in April 2023. That court then struck down the gerrymandered GOP-drawn state legislative map. Democratic Governor Tony Evers signed into law a new competitive state legislative map. Wikler’s activism is all over Wisconsin. Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin prevailed with a few thousand more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris, and both Harris and Baldwin got more votes than anyone in the history of the state other than Barack Obama in 2008, when he won by 14 points (and Trump). In an interview with The New York Times, Wikler said he aimed to do for the national party what he did in Wisconsin. 'The Democratic Party is best served by leadership that’s been fighting on the front lines in one of the most contested states in the country and has demonstrated an ability to build an operation that has shattered expectations for what was possible.' This is what Democrats must do nationally. Wikler is right when he says, 'Democrats win when voters know that we’re the ones fighting for them against those who will seek to rip them off to add an extra billion dollars to their bank account.' And he correctly calls for an approach 'grounded in where people actually get their information, not just where we want to speak or what we want to say.' Ben was one of the first to attack Project 2025 and link it to Trump. 'These ideas aren’t just bad. They’re dangerous for our country,' he said during the Republican National Convention. 'Donald Trump and JD Vance want to ransack the public treasury to hand out massive tax cuts to billionaires and stick working Americans with the bill.' Just 43 years old, Wikler started in politics as a research assistant for Al Franken and hasn’t looked back. Can he win? The DNC election is slated for February 1. The current chair is South Carolina Democrat Jaime Harrison, who is not running again. There are 448 voting members of the Democratic National Committee. Why is this important? Because for years, the Democratic National Committee has been little more than a fundraising machine, which means it’s been tilted toward sources of big money: billionaires, big corporations, and Wall Street. That’s precisely the problem. That’s why the DNC cut Bernie Sanders off at the knees when he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016. That’s why starting in the 1980s the party began turning its back on the working class. There’s no way the party can speak for the majority of working people in America when it’s reluctant to bite the hands that feed it. Wikler is a progressive who knows how to win elections with a Democratic Party that’s on the side of the little guy.

A Bangladeshi Perspective On Restoring Ties With India – OpEd	Jatiyo Nagorik Committee member Alauddin Mohammad calls for people to people interactions to end mutual suspicions Alauddin Mohammad, a member of the Bangladesh National Citizens' Committee Executive, seeks people-to-people contacts between Bangladesh and India to clear misunderstandings that had vitiated the relationship after the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a violent student-led movement in August this year. While Bangladeshis saw the ouster of Hasina's repressive regime as perfectly legitimate, India suspected that it was engineered either by Pakistan or the US or together, to nullify its traditionally close ties with Bangladesh particularly, Sheikh Hasina. New Delhi was particularly irked when the Interim Government led by the pro-US Chief Advisor Dr.Muhammad Yunus sought the extradition of Hasina from India to face criminal charges in a Dhaka court. Feelings ran really high in India when Islamic radicals attacked Hindu temples and a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Das Bhramachari, was arrested and denied bail for allegedly dishonouring the Bangladesh flag. The Hindus of Chittagong had earlier held mass demonstrations demanding protection. In Bangladesh, on the contrary, the popular narrative was that India was hatching a plot to use the Hindu minority in Bangladesh to discredit the Interim Government and eventually put protégé Hasina back in power. Relations between New Delhi and Dhaka stay frozen with no sign of an early thaw. It is against that background that this writer talked to Alauddin Mohammad, a National Citizens (Jatiyo Nagorik) Committee member. The Jatiyo Nagorik Committee came into being in September seeking to unite diverse groups in Bangladesh to establish a new 'political settlement for a democratic Bangladesh.' It aims to reform the State in line with the aspirations of the student-led mass uprising. It is run by a 55-member committee led by Nasir Uddin Patwary. Alauddin's Take Alauddin said: 'India is our neighbour, and we share a history and a cultural heritage with it. Moreover, in 1971, our freedom fighters together with Indian forces fought against Pakistan. This is an important part of our history which both countries celebrate. When it comes to bilateral relations Bangladeshis deserve a fair, people-to- people, state-to-state relationship with India.' 'Bangladesh is in no way a threat to the sovereignty for any country in this region including India. India should therefore help strengthen democratic institutions in Bangladesh and build people-to-people friendship between the countries so that there will be no room for hatred against each other. On Bangladesh's part, it can build and reaffirm confidence in the Indian political establishment,' he added. Giving a background to the New Delhi-Dhaka stand off from the Bangladeshi angle, Alauddin said: 'Unfortunately, India's relationship with Bangladesh was highly biased when the Awami League was in power which was an unpopular stand here. India supported the Awami League in exchange for unequal deals on many fronts which were unsustainable. India should give priority to the restoration of the democratic process in Bangladesh and deal with the democratically elected government.' Hindu-Muslim Conflict On the prickly issue of Muslim-Hindu conflict and the fears in India that Islamists inspired by Pakistan are gaining traction in Bangladesh, Alauddin, who is a Ph.D student, put the blame squarely on Sheikh Hasina. 'The Awami League (led by Hasina) did everything to throw the Islamic outfits out of the public sphere. Now, because a democratic space has been created, Islamists are more visible than before. But nobody is tagging them as militants. I think, the democratic process will break Islamophobia (in India), as it will make the Islamists play a constructive role in building the country like any other political group,' he said. He went on to say that the Hindus of Bangladesh are a significant part of Bangladeshi society and politics but 'unfortunately, they were used by the Awami regime to further its political ends.' 'The reality is that when Awami League was in power, there were numerous attacks on the minorities and nobody was punished. But when out of power the Awami League played the minority card to come to power,' Alauddin recalled. On the charges about minorities being attacked now, Alauddin said that these are exaggerated and fabricated. 'Immediately after Hasina's flight there were some attacks on Awami League leaders which included Hindu leaders as well. So the attacks were not against a minority as such, but against a political identity, namely, association with the Awami League,' he explained. Bangladeshi Muslims suspect that a section of Hindus is acting at India's behest. Alluding to this charge, Alauddin said that the Hindus are a large community in Bangladesh and there are several groups in it with different orientations. 'We cannot say that the whole community is under the influence of an outside force just because of the activities of a few radical groups in the community,' he stressed. 'In this context, it must be mentioned that 13 Hindus were killed during the police crackdown this year. But nobody mentioned this. The real situation as regards minorities in Bangladesh is better than what it was during Hasina's regime. Muslim preachers and Madrasas are now actively working with the minorities to ensure social harmony,' he claimed. First 100 days Alauddin assessed the performance of the post-Hasina Interim Government along several parameters. 'Because of Hasina's dictatorship, State institutions were weak and without legitimacy. The police force was absent from the scene after 5th August. In such a situation, restoring the administration was the biggest challenge facing the Interim Government, a task which the Interim Government fulfilled with quite a bit of success.' 'After that, the government had to create a democratic space for all political and social groups so that they could speak fearlessly. Restoring law and order was an achievement, but greater focus and careful management of law and order are needed now. The fragile banking system is showing signs of recovery. Several reform commissions are working to draft reports which will help rebuild the country's principal institutions, such as the judiciary, police and bureaucracy.' Drawbacks On the drawbacks, Alauddin said: 'There is an absence of a clear road map on what the Interim Government wants to do and how those will be executed. We demanded a new constitution because the old constitution had fascist features. The government is yet to reveal its stand on the new constitution, creating suspicion among the stakeholders in the uprising.'' 'Under the previous regime, the State was a single institution with the government machinery and the ruling party functioning in tandem. The Interim government is obliged to work with the old governmental machinery with a different mind-set. The Interim government is facing non-cooperation from bureaucrats. This is in addition to the absence of experienced personnel in the advisory panels themselves.' Political Space Restored On the change in the political atmosphere, the young leader said: 'There was no political activity in the last one and half decades in Bangladesh due to the absolute domination of the Awami League and Sheikh Hasina. The mass uprising was the only political action undertaken with her in power. But mass action has created a vast new space for political participation. Political parties now express their views freely.' 'But the government's inability to arrest the political criminals of the past is causing concern. Much work also needs to be done to bring justice for those who families which were victims of enforced disappearances,' he said. Economy Recovering The economy has to be cleared of oligarchs and crony capitalists, Alauddin stressed. 'More than US$ 148 billion was siphoned off from the economy during Hasina's rule. Public debt was at an all-time high at US$ 99 billion. The banks were struggling facing cash shortages. During the protests, major infrastructural damage took place. We have to assess the Interim Government's performance against this backdrop.' Pointing out to the brighter side, he said: 'In the first three months of FY '25 (July-September), export earnings increased by 7.62% reaching US$ 11.66 billion compared to US$ 10.83 billion during the same period in the last fiscal year. Remittances also showed an increase in July–October 2024 of nearly US$9 billion, a 30% increase from the previous year.' Human Rights The human rights situation has improved visibly, the activist said. 'There are no secret torture cells, no enforced disappearances, no harassment by the law enforcing agencies. Even Awami League's former MPs are getting bail on a regular basis which shows that the judicial system is functioning freely.' Bangladesh Nationalist Party On the prospects of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Alauudin said: ' The BNP is the largest and most popular political party in Bangladesh now. So far, BNP has been playing a balanced role, protecting the spirit of the July-August uprising. The BNP actively took part in forming the Interim Government and is now giving moral support to it. In any fair electoral contest, the BNP can emerge as the single largest party in parliament.' Awami League Asked if the Awami League could ever re-enter politics, he said: 'After the July massacre, people demanded Awami League leaders' trial. After the trial the Awami League can return to politics but they must own their guilt and seek public forgiveness for their complicity in the 'genocide'. Their leaders and beneficiaries had trafficked US$ 148 billion abroad from the economy in the last 15 years. They must bring the money back to the economy before coming back to politics. Their strength lies in the power of the plundered money, engineered bureaucracy, a particular historical narrative and a particular cultural thrust. Of course, finally, it the people who will decide whether or not the Awami League can come back to politics.' On the demand that the properties of Awami League MPs, who participated the 2014,2018,and the 2024 elections should be confiscated, Akauddin said: 'This demand is not a collective one from the students. The student body will not take any step without assessing the consequences. The primary goal of the youth is to unite the country with a common goal and to uphold the values that characterized the uprising.' Jatiyo Nagorik Party On the Jatiyo Nagrik Committee itself floating a political party, Alauddin said that a new party is not a priority for the youth in Bangladesh. 'The youth want to be a watchdog for upholding democracy and a clean administration. They may organise a party in response to a demand, but that demand has not arisen yet.' Army's Role Since the 1975 coup that toppled President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Bangladesh army had been actively interfering in politics till 1990. 'The army is a popular force in Bangladesh. It has been playing a crucial role at critical moments in the history of the country,' Alauddin said adding: 'In July 2024 it decided to be with the people and didn't take part in the killing of innocent protesters which brought them very close to the heart of the people. Currently, the army is working under the civil administration and trying to facilitate the reform process. I don't think there is significant change in its role in State affairs. ' 'A point we shouldn't forget is that the army lost 57 brilliant officers in a planned mutiny during Sheikh Hasina's regime, when justice couldn't be delivered. Still the army is showing a sense of responsibility in its interactions with the State administration.' No Stalemate In conclusion, Alauddin said: 'Bangladesh is not in a stalemate. There was a stalemate under the previous regime. The present government may face difficulties but it is a people's government. This government has an agenda to reform the State, and I believe there is a political consensus on reforms. The Bangladeshi people are now united.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdd7Fsih0lOzXLCA9Q3uRBm	2024-12-02T09:16:42-08:00	
Russia’s Record-Breaking Defense Budget And The Strains Of War – ...	On December 1, 2024, Russia unveiled its budget for 2025, setting aside an unprecedented $126 billion (13.5 trillion rubles) for national defense, accounting for 32.5% of government expenditures. This allocation surpasses the previous record of 2024 by a staggering $28 billion (three trillion rubles). Although the new three-year fiscal plan anticipates a slight reduction in military spending for 2026 and 2027, the sharp increase in defense funding underscores the immense demands of the war in Ukraine. The budget, approved by both chambers of Russia's parliament, reflects the nation's prioritization of military objectives amidst a grinding conflict. The War in Ukraine: Europe's Largest Conflict Since WWII The ongoing war in Ukraine, now entering its third year, is the most significant conflict in Europe since World War II. Russian forces have made incremental advances along key points of the frontline while defending against a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kursk region. Kursk stands out as the site of Kyiv's only major success in 2024, but the broader war remains defined by attritional tactics on both sides. Often described as a 'war of attrition,' the conflict has become a prolonged battle where each side seeks to exhaust the other's resources. Ukraine, with a smaller economy and fewer military assets, has been heavily reliant on Western support, receiving billions of dollars in aid. However, uncertainty clouds Ukraine's future prospects as the United States, one of its largest benefactors, undergoes a leadership transition. The impending presidency of Donald Trump has raised questions about whether American military and financial support will continue at the current scale. Russia, by contrast, benefits from a larger pool of resources, including more weapons, ammunition, and personnel. Yet, these advantages come at a cost, as the prolonged war exerts significant pressure on the Russian economy and society. Economic Strains and Domestic Pressures in Russia Russia's increased military spending over the past two years has fueled significant economic challenges, with signs of overheating becoming apparent. Inflation rates remain high, eroding the purchasing power of ordinary Russians. Compounding the issue, labor shortages have emerged across various sectors as resources and manpower are diverted toward the war effort. In an attempt to control inflation and stabilize the economy, the Russian Central Bank raised interest rates to 21% in October 2024—the highest in decades. These measures, while aimed at curbing economic volatility, have further strained businesses and households. Despite these efforts, the war's financial burden continues to weigh heavily on the nation. Human capital has also been severely impacted. The partial mobilization announced in late 2023 led to widespread panic and the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Russian men seeking to avoid conscription. This demographic loss not only affects military recruitment but also undermines economic productivity. The challenge of replenishing Russia's armed forces has grown acute, with battlefield casualties mounting and public support for additional mobilizations dwindling. North Korea's Role: Reinforcements and Weaponry Amid these challenges, Russia has turned to external allies for support, most notably North Korea. In November 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that approximately 11,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to the Kursk region to bolster Russian efforts on the frontlines. These reinforcements provide a temporary boost to Russia's manpower, addressing immediate gaps in its military ranks. In addition to soldiers, North Korea has supplied Russia with a significant portion of its weaponry. Ukrainian defense officials estimate that nearly one-third of the ballistic missiles used by Russian forces in 2024 originated from North Korea. This influx of material aid highlights the deepening military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, forged in the face of global condemnation and sanctions. While these contributions strengthen Russia's position in the short term, they raise questions about sustainability. North Korea's assistance is unlikely to offset the broader material losses Russia has incurred, particularly as the conflict continues to drain its resources. Ukraine's Resilience and the Role of Western Aid Despite its disadvantages in material and manpower, Ukraine has shown remarkable resilience, leveraging both its strategic ingenuity and international support. Western nations, including the United States, the European Union, and NATO allies, have collectively provided billions of dollars in military and humanitarian assistance. Advanced weaponry, intelligence sharing, and training programs have played a crucial role in bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities. However, the future of this support remains uncertain. In the United States, the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump introduces potential shifts in foreign policy. Trump's previous statements have signaled a more cautious approach to funding international conflicts, raising concerns about whether the flow of aid to Ukraine will continue uninterrupted. For Kyiv, the prospect of reduced Western support could pose significant challenges, further tilting the balance of power in Russia's favor. The Human Cost of the War As the war grinds on, the human toll continues to escalate on both sides. Russia's numerical advantage in terms of population is offset by significant battlefield losses. Ukrainian forces, though smaller in number, have employed asymmetric tactics to inflict substantial casualties on Russian troops. The human cost extends beyond soldiers, affecting civilians caught in the crossfire and those displaced by the conflict. In Russia, the societal impact of the war is becoming increasingly visible. Public discontent with mobilization efforts, economic hardship, and the loss of loved ones has begun to erode domestic support for the war. While the Kremlin has maintained strict control over the media narrative, growing skepticism within the population signals potential challenges to the government's ability to sustain the conflict. Ukraine, too, faces immense human suffering. Cities and infrastructure have been devastated by relentless missile strikes, many of which are attributed to North Korean weaponry supplied to Russia. The rebuilding process will be long and arduous, even if the conflict were to end tomorrow. The Road Ahead: Uncertainty and Escalation Risks As the war enters another year, both sides face a precarious future. For Russia, the question is whether its economic and human resources can sustain the prolonged conflict without triggering domestic unrest or systemic collapse. The strain on the economy, coupled with difficulties in recruitment and battlefield losses, poses significant risks. Ukraine, on the other hand, must navigate the dual challenges of countering Russian aggression and maintaining international support. Its ability to secure continued aid from Western allies will be critical to its survival and resistance. However, as geopolitical dynamics shift, particularly in the United States, the steadfastness of this support is far from guaranteed. For the international community, the ongoing war underscores the broader risks of escalation. The involvement of external actors like North Korea introduces additional complexity, while the economic and humanitarian fallout extends beyond the borders of Ukraine and Russia. Conclusion: A Conflict Without Resolution Russia's record-breaking defense budget for 2025 reflects its determination to continue prosecuting the war in Ukraine despite mounting challenges. However, the financial, human, and geopolitical costs of this prolonged conflict are becoming increasingly apparent. While North Korea's contributions may offer temporary relief, they do little to address the deeper systemic strains on Russia's economy and society. For Ukraine, resilience remains its defining feature, but the path forward is fraught with uncertainty. The sustained support of Western allies will be vital, yet the shifting political landscape, particularly in the United States, adds a layer of unpredictability. Ultimately, the war in Ukraine represents not just a military struggle but a broader contest of wills, resources, and strategies. Its outcome will have profound implications, not only for the two nations involved but for the future of European security and global stability. As both sides grapple with the immense costs, the prospects for resolution remain elusive, leaving the international community to navigate an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdd7Fsih0lOzQLaPCXiUbt3	2024-12-02T09:14:10-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: International Trade And The Region – O...	As no person was ever able to meet all his needs alone, there was always an exchange of goods and services throughout most of human history. Exchanging goods and services, of course for a price, is called by different names. It is called trade, commerce or simply markets and this has grown from simple communities to regions and countries and, indeed, across vast spaces covering continents. It is the international trade that involves this exchange of goods and services across countries and payments thereof that we will discuss in this article, including the payment systems involved and its impact thereof on the region. Trade or commerce is the purchase and sale of goods and services and may involve consumer goods, manufactured goods, raw materials, machinery, tourism, banking, insurance and other goods and services. When such trade or commerce is across borders with other countries, it gets more complicated than going to the store or market in the neighborhood or even when buying and selling within the same country. In this article we shall deal mostly with international trade, which deals with the category of commerce across countries and across continents. The market place is larger and the competition may be stiffer and it is why countries compete, selling their wares as far wide as is possible and buy raw materials from differing sources at cheaper or more reasonable prices. This competition may lead, sometimes, to complications that can cause wars and conflicts and hence wise men have always laid down rules to follow to lessen the occurrences of such conflict situations. There is the World Trade organization ('WTO'), the International Trade Centre ('ITC'), the International Chamber of Commerce ('ICC'), and a plethora of regional organizations like the United States Mexico and Canada ('USMCA'), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ('COMESA') and many others. Trade, more so, the international aspect of it, has contributed greatly to the growth of global economy, where the supply and demand and hence prices impact and/or are impacted by global events. Different countries have differing advantages, where some countries may have cheaper labor costs than others, or more capital or material resources than others or even more and better skills and technologies than others. It is the basis of the exchanges they make among themselves and with others. It is where international payment systems become essential for commercial, governmental, and non-governmental organizations, as well as for individuals to ease trade, investments and individual needs. The financial world has developed over the years processes and networks to ease and facilitate payments. There was once the telegraphic transfer or 'TT' system and there was the telex system and there was and still is the Clearing House Interbank Payment Systems ('CHIPS'), the Fedwire and Ripple, and others. But SWIFT or the Society for World-wide Financial Telecommunication appears to have absorbed most activities of international payments and currently dominates the field. The SWIFT payment system was developed in the 1970s and is based in Belgium. It is a network that connects as of April 2023 some 11,000 financial institutions from over some two hundred countries and in effect handles some 40% of all international payment transfers. International payments require certain procedures and protocols, which must be followed to avoid fraud, corruption, money-laundering and other evil activities. Other than information of payer and payee parties and accounts, it requires other important codes, namely the International Bank Account Number (the 'IBAN') and the Business Identifier Code ('BIC') i.e., the SWIFT Code. Now that we know how important world trade and payment systems are, one needs to explain why the Horn of Africa States region is so important in this matrix. For one, it is a poor region and does not contribute much to global trade and for two, it is full of its own idiosyncrasies of mismanagement and tribal/clannish approach to politics and political processes. Despite the aforesaid, it is still part of the world and is involved in world politics such as Ethiopia moving away from its traditional alliances of the West to the currently growing BRICS Plus institution bent on moving away from the current trade and settlement issues, using new currencies as the main currencies of reserves in the place of the United States’ mighty dollar, which makes the United States the banker of many of the nations of the world. Many of the current rules involve unwritten ones including the usage of the dominant United States Dollar whereas the BRICS Plus proposes to move to a new currency or usage of their own currencies to settle payments among themselves. This would definitely affect the region as Ethiopia with the largest population appears to be moving onto to the BRICS Plus camp and away from the traditional financial protocols although the country recently signed conditioned arrangements with both the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, perhaps playing what seems to be a dangerous double-dipping game. The region also overlooks the western shores of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, a passage way for some 11 to 12 percent of international trade including the vital energy source of oil and gas from the Arabian Gulf countries on the other side of the same seas. This makes the region a strategic energy transportation waterway and an equally significant global trade hub. One must note that it connects Asia, Africa and Europe and henceforth has links with the remaining continents. The Horn of Africa States region is reported to enjoy abundant resources and henceforth an immense potential, which thus attracts not only the major powers of the world but also other regional powers. These include among others the Peoples Republic of China, the United States of America, the European Union, The Russian Federation, the GCC countries, Egypt, and Türkiye, among others. The interest of all these parties is prompted by the potential exploitation opportunities of the resources of the region without putting in much in return. These may include safe passage of ships on the waterway connecting the Indian Ocean to the Suez Canal or investments in the agricultural potential of the region or accessing at cheap prices the enormous mineral resources of the region including the food stocks of its vast marine space. It is where it becomes important for the countries of the region to revisit their strategies. Instead of being pawns in the game of others, the countries of the region should be putting their heads together to forge a new path for the region. They should be working on turning tables to take advantage of those interested parties to create not a self-competing and self-destroying region but a cooperating region. The Horn of Africa States region would benefit more from this cooperation and economic integration to exploit the resources of the region for the mutual benefit of the countries of the region and for reducing the conflicts and the terror activities that is currently prevalent in the region. Through joint efforts, the region can create a secure space where normal investments can be made not only by the locals of the region but also by others from beyond the region. The region, indeed, has much to offer. It can grow in peace and face together the corrupting foreign interests bent on keeping it 'as is' backward and underdeveloped.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeNi3HFSKbdXJ8pADN3HjuL	2024-12-02T09:10:46-08:00	
Germany Allocates €181m To Support Bangladesh’s Sustainable Devel...	Germany has reaffirmed its longstanding partnership with Bangladesh by committing €180.807 million (approximately Tk2,265 crore) in financial and technical assistance. This new pledge aims to bolster key sectors such as renewable energy, technical education, trade infrastructure, and combating domestic violence against women and children, marking another milestone in a relationship that has spanned over five decades. Formalizing the Commitment On November 28, agreements formalizing this support were signed by Md Shahriar Kader Siddiky, Secretary of the Economic Relations Division under Bangladesh's Ministry of Finance, and Achim Tröster, the German Ambassador to Bangladesh. These agreements outline Germany's dual approach to development cooperation through both financial and technical aid. Of the total commitment, €45.8 million will be directed toward Technical Cooperation, while €135 million will fund Financial Cooperation projects. Key Focus Areas The cooperation agreement covers a wide range of initiatives, with an emphasis on sustainable development and social welfare. The primary areas of focus include- 1. Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Projects aimed at promoting sustainable energy practices, reducing reliance on non-renewable resources, and enhancing energy efficiency will be a cornerstone of this partnership. These initiatives align with Bangladesh's ongoing efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources. 2. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Investments in technical education and vocational training aim to equip Bangladesh's workforce with skills that meet the demands of a modern economy, fostering greater employment opportunities and productivity. 3. Trade and Infrastructure Development Germany's support for trade and infrastructure will focus on creating robust supply chains and enhancing connectivity to boost Bangladesh's export potential and global competitiveness. 4. Sustainable Urban Development With rapid urbanization posing challenges in cities across Bangladesh, German support will address issues such as housing, waste management, and transportation, contributing to more livable urban environments. 5. Protection of Biodiversity Preserving Bangladesh's rich natural heritage is another critical area of focus, with initiatives aimed at protecting ecosystems and promoting environmentally sustainable practices. 6. Combating Domestic Violence Against Women and Children A dedicated project under this agreement will address domestic violence, aiming to protect vulnerable groups and promote gender equity and social justice. A Legacy of Support This enduring partnership reflects a shared commitment to fostering sustainable development and addressing critical socio-economic challenges. Bangladesh has been a key partner in German Development Cooperation (GDC), one of 47 bilateral relationships maintained by Germany. Following the latest intergovernmental negotiations in May 2024, Germany pledged €180 million for bilateral development initiatives in Bangladesh. Since the inception of this partnership in the 1972, Germany has invested more than €3.5 billion in Bangladesh's development projects. Additionally, since 2017, over €185 million has been allocated to assist Rohingya refugees and their host communities in southeastern Bangladesh. The implementation of GDC projects in Bangladesh primarily involves state-owned agencies such as GIZ, KfW, and BGR, while the Development Cooperation Section of the German Embassy provides political guidance and ensures coordination with the Government of Bangladesh and other international partners. Focus Areas of Cooperation German Development Cooperation in Bangladesh centers on three bilaterally agreed core areas- 1. Climate and Energy: A Just Transition Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Bangladesh's rapid economic growth has led to a significant rise in energy demand, necessitating innovative, climate-friendly solutions. Germany supports Bangladesh's transition to renewable energy, sharing its own experiences in moving towards sustainable energy systems. Collaborating with the European Union, Germany co-leads the Team Europe Initiative for Green Energy Transition, promoting renewable and reliable energy sources. Sustainable Urban Development The challenges posed by rapid urbanization and climate change—such as severe flooding, droughts, cyclones, and rising sea levels—are particularly acute in Bangladesh's urban areas. To address these issues, GDC focuses on financing resilient infrastructure, enhancing mobility, and improving waste management systems. Emphasis is placed on low-carbon and adaptive solutions to make cities more sustainable and less vulnerable to climate-related risks. 2. Sustainable Economic Development, Training, and Employment Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Bangladesh faces labor market challenges, including high rates of informal employment and youth unemployment. Recognizing this, GDC has introduced TVET initiatives to equip workers with skills aligned with emerging sectors like renewable energy. These programs aim to diversify Bangladesh's economy and reduce dependence on traditional industries such as ready-made garments (RMG). Sustainable Supply Chains and Trade Infrastructure A significant focus is improving labor conditions and environmental standards, particularly in the RMG sector. Germany supports Bangladesh in aligning with international labor, social, and environmental standards, helping sustain export-driven growth as the country aims to graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. Germany's Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains complements these efforts by encouraging ethical practices across industries. Collaboration with organizations such as the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) has led to the establishment of help desks for Bangladeshi companies seeking guidance on sustainable supply chains. 3. Conserving Nature and Protecting Life Biodiversity Preservation Germany supports Bangladesh in strengthening ecosystem-based governance and preserving its natural resources. Projects focus on expanding protected areas through the integration of digital technologies, citizen science, and youth participation, with a particular emphasis on the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest.Through these efforts, GDC fosters the integrated management of coastal and marine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity conservation and promoting sustainable development in vulnerable regions like the Swatch of No Ground, a critical habitat for marine life. Broader Impacts Rohingya Support Since 2017, Germany has directed over €185 million toward aiding Rohingya refugees and the host communities in southeastern Bangladesh. These funds have supported infrastructure, healthcare, education, and environmental initiatives, ensuring sustainable living conditions for affected populations. Collaborative Framework GDC projects are implemented through partnerships involving government agencies, civil society, academia, and private sector stakeholders. Germany also collaborates with international bodies like the International Labour Organization (ILO) to advance sustainable development goals (SDGs) and climate action objectives. Strengthening Bilateral Ties The latest commitment underscores the depth of the Germany-Bangladesh relationship, which has evolved into a multifaceted partnership over the decades. Germany's consistent support reflects its recognition of Bangladesh's potential as an emerging economy and its strategic importance in South Asia. A Shared Vision Germany and Bangladesh share a vision of sustainable development that prioritizes economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Through collaborative projects, the two nations aim to address pressing global challenges such as climate change, inequality, and sustainable urbanization. Enhanced Collaboration The agreements also pave the way for deeper collaboration between government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private sector stakeholders in both countries. By leveraging shared expertise and resources, these partnerships are expected to yield long-term benefits for both nations. Looking Ahead As Bangladesh continues its journey toward becoming a middle-income country, partnerships like the one with Germany play a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). The latest commitment not only strengthens existing ties but also sets the stage for innovative projects that address emerging challenges. Broader Implications 1. Economic Growth By focusing on trade, infrastructure, and technical education, the partnership is poised to drive economic growth and create employment opportunities in Bangladesh. 2. Social Welfare Projects targeting domestic violence and urban development are expected to improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations and foster social equity. 3. Environmental Sustainability Investments in renewable energy, biodiversity protection, and sustainable urbanization underscore a commitment to combating environmental degradation and climate change. Conclusion Germany's €181 million commitment to Bangladesh reflects a strong, enduring partnership built on mutual respect and shared goals. By focusing on critical areas such as renewable energy, education, and social welfare, this cooperation promises to drive sustainable development and improve lives across Bangladesh.

Key Considerations In Negotiations With Chinese Companies – OpEd	In Turkish domestic tenders, many Chinese companies continue to secure projects by leveraging Chinese Eximbank project financing support and offering competitive pricing. While tenders for fossil-fuel thermal power plants have ended, recent news highlights plans for the production of 150,000 electric cars annually in Manisa organised industrial zone. It is noted that 2,500 Chinese workers will be employed during the production phase. But how will these workers be housed, fed, and integrated with the local community? Clearly, the processes involved are far from straightforward. Unfortunately, our local investors and public institutions often enter such negotiations insufficiently prepared, leaving them vulnerable to Chinese negotiation tactics and frequently ending up on the losing side. So, how can this change? How can one work effectively with Chinese companies, conduct successful negotiations, and address critical points? Key Differences in Negotiations with Chinese Firms The belief that 'negotiation tactics are universal' is widespread; however, negotiations and contracting processes with Chinese counterparts carry distinct characteristics. While we typically operate under a win-win principle, for the Chinese, contract negotiation resembles a form of 'war.' They often apply strategies outlined in The Art of War, a 2,500-year-old work by Sun Tzu. Reading this book is highly recommended as part of your preparation. The Importance of Location Whenever possible, conduct negotiations in your own country. If this isn't feasible, opt for a neutral third country. As a last resort, choose a Chinese city you are already familiar with. Negotiating in an unfamiliar Chinese city places you at a significant disadvantage. Time and Concession Management Chinese negotiators create time pressure from the outset. For example, the staff who meet you at the airport may ask, 'When are you leaving?' Avoid providing a clear answer. Keeping your return date ambiguous can disrupt their tactics. Also, decline pre-signature dinner invitations, as socializing before negotiations can be risky. Throughout negotiations, the Chinese side may repeatedly bring up new issues to wear you down. It is crucial to hold firm on your key principles. While a signing ceremony may seem enticing, never make concessions to secure it; cancel the ceremony if necessary. Chinese Negotiation Tactics and Strategies Chinese negotiators often request revisions at every stage, causing project delays and exhaustion. It is vital to adhere strictly to the terms agreed upon initially. Do not hesitate to cancel agreements or enforce penalty clauses when necessary. Chinese negotiators typically have limited decision-making authority and frequently consult their senior management. Therefore, insist that decision-makers participate in the negotiations; otherwise, the discussions will be largely unproductive. Contracting and Implementation Phases Contracts must be drafted in English, with the English version being the legally binding one. Technical documentation should also be in English. Stand firm against continuous requests for changes and revisions. Keep in mind that negotiations will likely continue post-signature, with ongoing demands for adjustments. Working and negotiating with Chinese companies is undoubtedly challenging. However, with a robust strategy, these processes can be managed effectively. Preparation, maintaining firm principles, and demonstrating professionalism are critical at every stage of agreements with Chinese firms. Remember: the more resolute you are, the more respect you will command. Losing ground, however, diminishes your value.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeNi3HFSKbdXGJsIeHWW_qR	2024-12-02T09:05:01-08:00	
US President Joe Biden On Pardon Of Son Hunter – Statement	Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. Executive Grant of ClemencyJoseph R. Biden, Jr.President of the United States of America To All to Whom These Presents Shall Come, Greeting: Be It Known, That This Day, I, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United States, Pursuant to My Powers Under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution, Have Granted Unto ROBERT HUNTER BIDEN A Full and Unconditional Pardon For those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, including but not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C. Weiss in Docket No. 1:23-cr-00061-MN in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Docket No. 2:23-CR-00599-MCS-1 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF I have hereunto signed my name and caused the Pardon to be recorded with the Department of Justice. Done at the City of Washington this 1st day of December in the year of our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty-four and of the Independence of the United States the Two Hundred and Forty-ninth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum3ymKlMfHqOs	2024-12-01T17:41:39-08:00	
China’s Wagner? Beijing Establishes Private Security Company In M...	By Antonio Graceffo China is collaborating with the Myanmar military junta to establish a joint security company to protect Chinese investments and personnel in Myanmar. On October 22, 2024, the junta formed a working committee to draft a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the initiative, reflecting China’s growing concerns over the security of its projects, particularly those under the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. As a key part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), CMEC comprises highways, railways, pipelines, and economic zones connecting China’s Kunming province to the deep-sea Kyaukpyu Port in Myanmar’s Rakhine State. The economic corridor is vital to Beijing, providing direct access to the Indian Ocean and bypassing the strategically vulnerable Malacca Strait, a chokepoint critical to China’s energy and trade supply lines, particularly in the event of a conflict with the United States. Yet unfortunately for Beijing, many CMEC projects pass through some of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones. Since pro-democracy opposition armies declared a 'people’s defensive war' in 2021, Chinese projects, including oil and gas pipelines, have come under increasing threat. Notably, in January 2022, a local People’s Defense Force attacked the $800 million Tagaung Taung nickel processing plant. More recently, the Chinese consulate in Mandalay was damaged in a bombing attack last month. While no group has claimed responsibility, both the People’s Defense Forces and the National Unity Government (NUG) have condemned the incident. The announcement of a joint security company has sparked controversy in Myanmar, with many arguing that it could be perceived as a breach of the country’s sovereignty. Myanmar’s 2008 constitution prohibits the deployment of foreign troops on its soil, and the framing of this initiative as a Chinese 'company' in a joint venture appears to be a strategic move to deflect accusations of a foreign military intervention. By structuring the company as private and partially Burmese, Beijing can claim arm’s-length deniability, distancing itself from direct involvement while potentially directing the security force to carry out state-derived foreign policy objectives. The deployment of a Chinese private security company (PSC) comes at a critical moment in the Myanmar civil war, and amid sustained financial and military support for the junta, including shipments of weapons and aircrafts. But above all Beijing’s motivation for establishing the joint venture signals waning confidence in the junta’s ability to protect Chinese investments and personnel. Such concerns are underscored by the junta’s overstretched military forces, which have lost significant ground and numerous bases and outposts to pro-democracy rebels, further eroding the junta’s presence across Myanmar. In late October 2024, Chinese authorities reportedly placed Peng Daxun, commander of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), under house arrest in Kunming, Yunnan Province, to pressure the group to withdraw from Lashio. The MNDAA’s capture of Lashio in August 2024 dealt a major blow to Myanmar’s junta. Lashio, a strategic hub in northern Shan State, serves as a gateway to China’s Yunnan Province and central Myanmar along the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC). Its control is vital for ensuring the flow of Chinese investments and trade. China frequently claims to adhere to its official stance of non-intervention in the sovereign affairs of other nations, yet developments in the Myanmar civil war suggest an active involvement. By detaining Peng Daxun, Beijing seems to be stepping in where it perceives the junta has failed, underscoring its wider rationale for establishing a private security company in Myanmar. Beijing already has numerous private security companies operating globally, including four in Myanmar, in areas where China has significant strategic and economic interests. The largest Chinese security companies include De Wei Security Group Ltd, Hua Xin China Security, Guan An Security Technology, China Overseas Security Group, and Frontier Services Group. The idea of a Chinese security company is reminiscent of Russia’s Wagner Group, a private military company (PMC) that has been heavily involved in conflicts across Africa, the Middle East, and Ukraine. Wagner functions as an unofficial extension of Russian state power, providing military training, combat support, and securing strategic assets, often under the guise of protecting Russian interests abroad. Its operations frequently involve direct combat roles, covert military activities, and securing resource-rich areas, making it an instrument of geopolitical influence for Moscow. In contrast, Chinese private security companies primarily focus on safeguarding infrastructure projects, personnel, and investments linked to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Unlike Wagner, these companies avoid direct combat roles, instead specializing in site security, risk management, and logistical support. However, the proposed firm in Myanmar will be a joint venture with the junta, introducing a new dynamic. It is already known that this company will facilitate arms shipments and deliveries to the junta. As a junta-aligned company, it may operate with fewer restrictions and potentially involve heavily armed personnel, diverging from the usual limitations imposed on Chinese PSCs. The joint arrangement could also mean the company is not bound to adhere strictly to Chinese regulations, raising concerns that it might take on a more militarized role than typical Chinese security firms. In an extreme case, there is speculation that Chinese security firms could take an active role in the junta’s fight against pro-democracy forces, similar to the role that Russia’s Wagner Group has played in its engagements in Africa and the Middle East. Incidentally, the joint private security company approach is also being attempted in Pakistan, where a string of recent attacks against Chinese citizens and economic interests have shaken faith in Islamabad’s ability to protect the CPEC corridor. In response to the announcement, Myanmar’s civilian National Unity Government (NUG) asserted that collaborating with the NUG and revolutionary forces is the only viable way to effectively protect Chinese investments and operations in Myanmar. The NUG further emphasized its commitment to safeguarding lawful investments and fostering friendly relations with neighboring countries. The messaging serves to reassure Beijing that, even if Myanmar transitions to democracy, it will continue to maintain trade relations with China. Yet it seems for now that Beijing is not ready to abandon the junta, and amid a fraught outlook on the battlefield, the deployment of a Chinese private security company is the only way to ensure the junta’s survival. For its part, the NUG remains isolated, lacking in both recognition from Western powers and a direct line of communication with Beijing.

China Debuts New Fighter Plane: How Does It Compare To The F-35? ...	By Tara McKelvey When it debuted at an air show in Zhuhai, China, earlier last month, the J-35 fighter plane made an impression. Produced by a Chinese aviation company, Shenyang, the new jet took more than a decade to build- and bears more than a passing resemblance a U.S. fighter, the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin. As the U.S. Air Force’s chief of staff, David Allvin, told Air & Space Forces Magazine, the similarities between the two aircraft were striking. Both models have silver-grey wings, a pointed nose and a smooth, slicked-back design. Though made in two different countries, they looked as if they came from the same factory. If you were to put the two jets side-by-side, said Allvin, you could practically see where they both 'got their blueprints.' That in itself is an achievement for the Chinese military, which has for years struggled to compete with the U.S. military advances. Still, there are differences between the two aircraft. The Chinese-made J-35 is more svelte than the American jet—despite the fact that the Chinese model has two engines, while the U.S.-made F-35 has one. Chinese designers may have chosen to build their aircraft with two engines to give the jet more power, says Douglas Royce, a senior aircraft analyst with the Sandy Hook, Connecticut-based research company, Forecast International. But the design could have also been chosen for a more primitive reason: the second engine could serve as a backup in case of mission failure. 'Maybe they have less faith in the reliability of the aircraft,' says Greg Malandrino, a former U.S. fighter pilot now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Chinese pilots will have to make do with a smaller workspace than American F-35 pilots, according to Boyko Nikolov, the head of a media company Bulgarian Military. The U.S. fighter jet’s cockpit is cushier, roomier, with a bigger canopy, while the Chinese plane’s cockpit reflects 'a more utilitarian approach to pilot ergonomics,' according to Nikolov. Malandrino, says he did not notice any significant differences in the design of the two cockpits. Besides, as he points out, the cockpit of a fighter jet, whether Chinese or American, is not known for comfort. The seat is designed to provide the pilot with a way out of a tricky situation. 'You’re sitting on ejection seat,' he says. 'It’s basically a rocket seat.' Others questioned whether the Chinese jet, however well-designed, is all that sneaky. According to aviation expert Dario Leone, the J-35 spits a lot of smoke from its exhaust pipe when it’s in the air, which could make it easier to detect the plane. But experts agree that the real power of a fighter jet lies in the overall strength of the military they serve. Says Forecast International’s Royce: 'People are thinking about two jets operating in a dog fight. But in the real world, it depends on the entire combat system.' 'Until the two countries fight, it’s just guesswork,' Royce says. 'You really don’t know till the shooting starts.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum-3Vkp6vYVr0	2024-12-01T17:32:13-08:00	
Tech, Talent And Trump Pose Risks To Vietnam’s Economic Strategy ...	By David Dapice Vietnam, one of Southeast Asia’s star performers, finds itself facing an all-too-common problem. Having rapidly grown its economy by bringing its workforce into low value-added manufacturing jobs, Vietnam’s model is now threatened by technology and labour constraints, as well as the spectre of Western protectionism against its exports. In 2024, Vietnam’s economy will likely experience a solid 6–6.5 per cent growth rate, but investment into critical AI infrastructure and technological development is essential to ensure future economic growth. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund forecast continued growth of around 6 per cent in 2025, as many US-bound exports have shifted from China to Southeast Asia where Vietnam remains a major beneficiary. The country has a 4 per cent inflation rate and low debt, a trade surplus and continuing inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). But newly registered FDI grew only 1–2 per cent in 2024, falling in real terms. Vietnam’s ability to move more than a million workers a year from farms to factories and other urban jobs — and in doing so, boost worker productivity and GDP growth — is diminishing. With fewer young workers to do assembly jobs, the low value-added model of Vietnam’s exports is approaching its limits. From 2018 to 2019, manufacturing jobs grew by 1.3 million but from 2022 to 2023, they grew by only 0.2 million. The result was that GDP growth fell from 7.4 per cent in 2019 to 5 per cent in 2023. A further complication facing Vietnam’s economy comes from US President-elect Donald Trump. He is a fan of tariffs and dislikes getting ‘ripped off’ when US imports exceed exports to a particular country. The US Census reports that the trade deficit with Vietnam amounts to US$10 billion a month in 2024. Even worse, a lot of those exports include imported inputs from China which were lightly processed to avoid tariffs on direct Chinese exports to the United States. While Vietnam does not subsidise these exports, China may subsidise its exports through Vietnam. Vietnam benefits from this middleman status and curbing it would slow growth. With Trump’s appointees targeting Mexican and Canadian exports involving Chinese inputs, Vietnam is likely to face similar treatment. It would help tariff negotiations if Vietnam added more value itself, especially from domestic companies. But this is not happening enough. For example, from 2019 to 2023, Vietnam reported that exports to the United States rose by US$34 billion, while imports into Vietnam from China grew by US$30 billion. In September 2024, a Chinese economist wrote about the low level of domestic firms’ value added in Vietnam’s exports, especially for the fast-growing electronics sector. In 2019, Vietnam’s Politburo Resolution No. 52-NQ/TW also identified the weakness of Vietnam’s domestic industrial sector in its ‘Industry 4.0’ analysis and recommendations. But there has been limited progress in the last five years. Some argue this is because officials only understand top-down directives, while others point to private firms being underutilised as a source of revenue for potential development opportunities. In any case, adding export restrictions to a still-lagging real estate sector would depress retail consumer spending growth of about 4 per cent a year in real terms, capping sales of domestic firms. A more forward-looking example of Vietnam lagging behind is evident in its hyperscale data centre infrastructure. Hyperscale data centres process inquiries for — and teach — large language models for artificial intelligence. Vietnam has so far tried to ‘go it alone’ but its data centres are only 5–10 per cent the size of its competitors, much less secure and lack value-added services for local companies. The rules on data localisation are cumbersome and uncompetitive with Malaysia or Singapore. For example, as of mid-2024, Vietnam’s existing, under-construction, committed and early-stage data centre investments stand at 143 megawatts compared to 3,221 megawatts in Malaysia. Vietnam has also had trouble supplying adequate electricity for existing factories in the north — there is not enough transmission capacity when hydroelectricity is limited due to drought. While transmission to the north — but not the south — is being remedied, green energy contracts are frozen due to a reluctance to sign agreements similar to those given to coal plants. This poses an issue give many FDI data centre companies want green energy. Vietnamese Communist Party Secretary General To Lam has spoken about a new era of technology. If Lam realises just how threatened existing exports may be due to tariffs and how far behind Vietnam is in critical AI infrastructure, he may be able to reorient growth away from low value-added exports, which face demographic headwinds, and rapidly strengthen the private sector. This is the only way that Vietnam can reduce the income-per-capita and technology gap with China and maintain its functional independence and ‘bamboo diplomacy’. So long as Trump’s tariffs do not impede growth, Vietnam’s outlook for 2025 can remain positive. But this will only be a short-term respite — like in other middle-income economies, the gains from moving low-productivity workers to more productive jobs are slowly fading.

From Marcus Aurelius To Omar Little: A Man’s Code Is Vital – OpEd	As this Thanksgiving weekend draws to a close, my gratitude centers not on the usual holiday platitudes, but on something that has become increasingly precious in our artificial age: authentic relationships – both family and lifelong friends – that deepen rather than fracture under pressure. What binds these relationships, I’ve come to realize, isn’t shared opinions or circumstances, but a shared code – an unwavering commitment to principles that transcends the shifting sands of politics and social pressure. I’m particularly grateful for my inner circle – friends I’ve known since elementary school and family members whose bonds have only strengthened through the crucible of recent years. Like many others who spoke out against Covid tyranny, I watched what I thought were solid relationships dissolve in real time. As the owner of a local brewery and coach of my kids’ sports teams, I had been deeply embedded in my community – a 'man about town' whose friendship and counsel others actively sought. Yet suddenly, the same people who had eagerly engaged with me would scurry when they saw me coming down the street. Professional networks and neighborhood connections evaporated at the mere questioning of prevailing narratives. They reacted this way because I broke orthodoxy, choosing to stand for liberal values – the very principles they claimed to champion – by rejecting arbitrary mandates and restrictions. In this moment of testing, the difference between those who lived by a consistent code and those who simply followed social currents became starkly clear. Yet in retrospect, this winnowing feels more like clarification than loss. As surface-level relationships fell away, my core relationships – decades-long friendships and family bonds – not only endured but deepened. These trials revealed which bonds were authentic and which were merely situational. The friendships that remained, anchored in genuine principles rather than social convenience, proved themselves infinitely more valuable than the broader network of fair-weather friends I lost. What strikes me most about these enduring friendships is how they’ve defied the typical narrative of relationships destroyed by political divisions. As Marcus Aurelius observed, 'The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.' Despite taking opposite sides of the dialectic on political and cultural issues over the decades, we found ourselves united in opposition to the constitutional transgressions and rising tyranny of the past few years – the lockdowns, mandates, and systematic erosion of basic rights. This unity emerged not from political alignment but from a shared code: a commitment to first principles that transcends partisan divisions. In these contemplative moments, I’ve found myself returning to Aurelius’s Meditations – a book I hadn’t opened since college until Joe Rogan and Marc Andreessen’s excellent conversation inspired me to revisit it. Aurelius understood that a personal code – a set of unwavering principles – was essential for navigating a world of chaos and uncertainty. The connection feels particularly apt – like my own friend group, Rogan’s platform exemplifies a code of authentic discourse in our age. Critics, particularly on the political left, often talk about needing their 'own Joe Rogan,' missing entirely what makes his show work: its genuine authenticity. Despite being historically left-leaning himself, Rogan’s willingness to engage in real-time thinking with guests across the ideological spectrum and across a broad variety of topics, his commitment to open inquiry and truth-seeking, has paradoxically led to his estrangement from traditional liberal circles – much like many of us who’ve found ourselves branded as apostates for maintaining consistent principles. This commitment to a code of authentic discourse explains why organizations like Brownstone Institute – despite being routinely smeared as 'far right' – have become a crucial platform for independent scholars, policy experts, and truth-seekers. I witnessed this firsthand at a recent Brownstone event, where, unlike most institutions that enforce ideological conformity, diverse thinkers engaged in genuine exploration of ideas without fear of orthodoxy enforcement. When attendees were asked if they considered themselves political liberals ten years ago, nearly 80% raised their hands. These are individuals who, like my friends and me, still embrace core liberal values – free speech, open inquiry, rational debate – yet find themselves branded as right-wing or conspiracy theorists merely for questioning prevailing narratives. What unites this diverse community is their shared recognition that the reality being presented to us is largely manufactured, as explored in 'The Information Factory,' and their commitment to maintaining authentic discourse in an age of enforced consensus. In The Wire, Omar Little, a complex character who lived by his own moral code while operating outside conventional society, famously declared, 'A man got to have a code.' Though a stick-up man targeting drug dealers, Omar’s rigid adherence to his principles – never harming civilians, never lying, never breaking his word – made him more honorable than many supposedly 'legitimate' characters. His unwavering dedication to these principles – even as a gangster operating outside society’s laws – resonates deeply with my experience. Like Rogan’s commitment to open dialogue, like Brownstone’s dedication to free inquiry, like RFK Jr.’s determination to expose how pharmaceutical and agricultural interests have corrupted our public institutions: these exemplars of authentic truth-seeking mirror what I’ve found in my own circle. My friends and I may have different political views, but we share a code: a commitment to truth over comfort, to principle over party, to authentic discourse over social approval. This shared foundation has proven more valuable than any superficial agreement could be. In these times of manufactured consensus and social control, the importance of this authentic foundation becomes even clearer. The 2012 Smith-Mundt Modernization Act, which made it legal to propagandize American citizens, merely formalized what many had long suspected. It represented the ultimate betrayal of the government’s code with its citizens – the explicit permission to manipulate rather than inform. As anyone not under the spell has come to realize – we’ve all been thoroughly 'Smith-Mundt’ed.' This legal framework helps explain much of what we’ve witnessed in recent years, particularly during the pandemic – when those who proclaimed themselves champions of social justice supported policies that created new forms of segregation and devastated the very communities they claimed to protect. This disconnect becomes even more apparent in the realm of charitable giving and social causes, where 'virtue laundering' has become endemic. The absence of a genuine moral code is nowhere more evident than in our largest charitable institutions. While many charitable organizations do crucial work at the local level, there’s an unmistakable trend among large NGOs toward what a friend aptly calls the 'philanthropath class.' Consider the Clinton Foundation’s activities in Haiti, where millions in earthquake relief funds resulted in industrial parks that displaced farmers and housing projects that never materialized. Or examine the BLM Global Network Foundation, which purchased luxury properties while local chapters reported receiving minimal support. Even major environmental NGOs often partner with the world’s biggest polluters, creating an illusion of progress while fundamental problems persist. This pattern reveals a deeper truth about the professional charitable class – many of these institutions have become purely extractive, profiting from and even amplifying the very issues they purport to solve. At the top, a professional philanthropic class collects fancy titles in their bios and flashes photos from charity galas while avoiding any genuine engagement with the problems they claim to address. Social media has democratized this performance, allowing everyone to participate in virtue theater – from black squares and Ukrainian flag avatars to awareness ribbons and cause-supporting emojis – creating an illusion of activism without the substance of real action or understanding. It’s a system entirely devoid of the moral code that once guided charitable work – the direct connection between benefactor and beneficiary, the genuine commitment to positive change rather than personal aggrandizement. The power of a genuine code becomes most evident in contrast with these hollow institutions. While organizations and social networks fracture under pressure, I’m fortunate that my closest friendships and family bonds have only grown stronger. We’ve had fierce debates over the years, but our shared commitment to fundamental principles – to having a code – has allowed us to navigate even the most turbulent waters together. When the pandemic response threatened basic constitutional rights, when social pressure demanded conformity over conscience, these relationships proved their worth not despite our differences, but because of them. As we navigate these complex times, the path forward emerges with striking clarity. From Marcus Aurelius to Omar Little, the lesson remains the same: a man gotta have a code. The crisis of authenticity in our discourse, the chasm between proclaimed and lived values, and the failure of global virtue-signaling all point to the same solution: a return to genuine relationships and local engagement. Our strongest bonds – those real relationships that have weathered recent storms – remind us that true virtue manifests in daily choices and personal costs, not in digital badges or distant donations. This Thanksgiving, I find myself grateful not for the easy comforts of conformity but for those in my life who demonstrate real virtue – the kind that comes with personal cost and requires genuine conviction. The answer lies not in grand gestures or viral posts, but in the quiet dignity of living according to our principles, engaging with our immediate communities, and maintaining the courage to think independently. As both the emperor-philosopher and the fictional street warrior understood, what matters isn’t the grandeur of our station but the integrity of our code. Returning one final time to Meditations, I’m reminded of Aurelius’s timeless challenge: 'Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.'

The Strategic Defeat Of Iran’s Regime In The Region: Consequences...	The Iranian regime, already mired in insurmountable domestic crises and faced with persistent uprisings that have pushed it to the brink of collapse, sought to shift the narrative through regional conflict. On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched an attack on Israel, seemingly with Tehran's endorsement, aiming to achieve two goals: 1. Suppress internal dissent and prevent renewed uprisings. 2. Create a regional distraction, hoping the conflict would result in a temporary or permanent ceasefire, ultimately allowing Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to solidify his rule. However, this gambit miscalculated the response of Israel’s right-wing government, which identified Iran as the mastermind behind the attack. Israel resolved to neutralize the threat posed by Iran's regional proxies, particularly Hezbollah, Iran's most valuable militant asset in Lebanon. Hezbollah's Retreat: A Strategic Blow Despite Tehran’s initial attempts to keep Hezbollah out of full-scale conflict, the flames of war engulfed the group, leading to devastating losses. Within two months, Hezbollah was forced to sign a ceasefire with Israel. This retreat underscored the regime’s declining influence in a changing Middle East. Simultaneously, the situation in Syria spiralled out of Tehran's control. Emboldened by Hezbollah’s setbacks, Syrian opposition forces launched a surprise offensive, recapturing key areas like Aleppo and Hama. The Iranian regime's investments in Syria, once a symbol of its regional dominance, crumbled in mere days. Domestic Implications of Regional Losses The regime’s strategic depth is collapsing, further fuelling domestic unrest. Social dissatisfaction, driven by economic crises, has reached boiling point. Iranian regime President Masoud Pezeshkian recently admitted to the growing crises: 'Forty-five years after the revolution, our problems worsen daily. If we had chosen the right path, why are we here? Clearly, we are at fault.' Economic mismanagement, exemplified by ballooning debt and failing institutions, exacerbates the regime's fragility. The conservative-dominated parliament, fearful of the nation's explosive socio-economic conditions, has turned against Pezeshkian's administration, rejecting key legislative reforms. Protests across Iran continue to highlight the population's demand for systemic change. Mounting International Pressure On the international stage, Iran faces renewed scrutiny over its nuclear ambitions. On November 21, the IAEA issued its second resolution in five months, condemning Tehran's lack of transparency regarding undeclared nuclear sites. The regime also risks the activation of the 'snapback mechanism,' which could reimpose comprehensive international sanctions. Europe, historically favouring diplomacy with Iran, is shifting its stance. A conference in Brussels, attended by Maryam Rajavi and European Parliament members, underscored this policy shift. The conference highlighted the need for a tougher approach to counter Iran's destabilizing activities and support for a democratic alternative. A Democratic Alternative: A Vision for Post-Regime Iran Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), outlined a roadmap for Iran’s transition to democracy during the Brussels conference. Her plan includes: 1. A six-month transitional government tasked with organizing elections for a constitutional assembly. 2. Dissolution of the NCRI upon the assembly's formation, transferring power to elected representatives. 3. Drafting a new constitution and holding a referendum to establish a democratic republic. Rajavi emphasized the NCRI's commitment to a society based on freedom, equality, and the rule of law, rejecting all forms of dictatorship. Key tenets of her vision include gender equality, freedom of speech, separation of religion and state, and the abolition of the death penalty. Conclusion The Iranian regime’s regional losses and escalating domestic and international crises signal an irreversible decline. As Tehran struggles to maintain control, the possibility of a democratic transition grows stronger. The alternative proposed by the NCRI offers a hopeful vision for an Iran free from oppression, poised to re-join the global community as a peaceful and democratic nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum3aW42jO4oa7	2024-12-01T17:22:09-08:00	
Circassians Have A Chance To Lead Coming Parade Of Exits From Mus...	Below is a speech I delivered online to the Second International Conference on Independent Circassia on Nov. 23. A video of this speech is available at youtu.be/AG8f94YS164?si=B_VxbzzCnfVD1-fz, and I want to thank Adel Bashqawi for producing a text version of it (justicefornorthcaucasus.info/?p=1251685433). I reproduce the text here with my own title for readers of Window on Eurasia Circassia’s Prospects for Recovering Independence have Never Been Better A year ago, I had the opportunity to speak at an earlier conference of the ICIC, and I am honored and extremely pleased to have the chance to return and speak with you again. Although I know far less about Circassians and the Circassian cause than most of you, I can present the perspective of a sympathetic and supportive outsider, which is what I plan to do this morning. As I said a year ago, I am—and remain—quite sure that Circassia is on the path to being restored. I believe this will happen within a decade or less, its independence will be recognized, and we will celebrate an enormous Circassian victory after so many years of struggle. However, at that time, I also cautioned that the final steps toward achieving these goals may prove to be the most difficult. The events of the ensuing months have only reinforced my confidence in both my prediction of Circassian independence and the immense challenges that lie ahead due to Moscow’s reactions. Ironically, while Moscow’s responses have made the outcome more likely, they have also complicated the path forward. I believe the Circassian community will overcome these challenges only by confronting them directly and making full use of the resources at their disposal. Today, I would like to revisit some of what I said last year and provide an update in light of changes in the international environment. The strategies Circassians need to employ to achieve their goals have evolved in fundamental ways, and these changes must be recognized. Five Key Considerations for the Circassian Cause As I stated a year ago, Circassians and their supporters must keep five crucial considerations in mind as they pursue their goals. These points highlight both the resources available to Circassians and the difficulties in using them effectively, particularly in the face of Moscow’s likely escalation of its police powers, diplomatic efforts, security services, and propaganda aimed at discrediting the Circassian cause. 1. The Unique Strength of the Circassian Nation Circassians are uniquely positioned among non-Russian peoples within the current borders of the Russian Federation. They have a large and increasingly assertive ethnic population in their homeland and an even larger, nationally conscious diaspora. In fact, the Circassians have the largest diaspora of any people within Russia’s borders. Moreover, many Circassians, including some of you here today, have learned to leverage social media to unite their homeland and diaspora communities. This creates a powerful dynamic: actions in one part of the Circassian nation strengthen the other, and Moscow’s moves against one lead to new losses for Russia elsewhere. 2. Ukraine as a Strategic Ally Never before has the Circassian nation had as important an ally as it does now in Ukraine. Kyiv recognizes Circassians as natural allies in their shared struggle against Russian imperialism. The deeper Russia becomes embroiled in its war of aggression, the more Ukraine can be counted on to support the Circassian cause. If someone had predicted in 2020 that the Ukrainian parliament would endorse Circassia, it would have seemed unimaginable. Now, it’s only a matter of time before we see stronger declarations of support. 3. The International Shift in Perception The international community is increasingly recognizing a truth they were once reluctant to admit: Putin embodies the problem, but the Russian Federation’s existence as an imperial state is an enduring threat to world peace. For true stability, Russia must be dismantled. The Circassians, along with other unrecognized or submerged peoples, stand to benefit from this geopolitical shift. The collapse of Russia’s centralized administration offers Circassians an unprecedented opportunity to reclaim their independence. 4. Alliances Within Russia Circassians also have potential allies within the Russian Federation, including ethnic Russians outside Moscow’s power structure. These regionalists and non-Muscovite Russians also suffer under the centralized 'Muscovite yoke' and increasingly see Circassians as a leading force for post-imperial transformation. Much like the Baltic nations’ role at the end of Soviet times, Circassians are poised to play a leadership role in shaping a post-Russian reality. 5. Moscow’s Institutional Weakness In Soviet and early post-Soviet times, Moscow’s institutions were stronger, making it harder for Circassians to achieve their goals. Now, Putin’s systematic destruction of these institutions has backfired. This collapse makes the prospect of a radically new political order more likely, benefiting peoples like the Circassians. Recognizing this moment’s significance is critical. Avoiding Self-Defeating Attitudes Despite these opportunities, there are risks. Some may view the challenges as insurmountable and retreat into inaction, while others might assume victory is inevitable and fail to act decisively. Both attitudes are dangerous. Inaction forfeits today’s advantages, while complacency allows Moscow to claim undeserved victories. Circassians must act carefully, thoughtfully, and urgently. They must adapt to the shifting international environment and focus their efforts where they will have the greatest impact. Focus on Europe and Turkey Circassians must recognize that the future of their cause is now more dependent on Europe and Turkey than on the United States. While it is painful for me as an American to admit, Europe—along with Ankara—will play a more decisive role in shaping the region’s future. Circassians should focus their diplomatic and advocacy efforts on Brussels, Paris, Berlin, and Ankara while continuing to engage with Kyiv and their fraternal peoples within Russia. Leveraging the Diaspora The Circassian diaspora remains a unique and invaluable resource. To maximize its impact, Circassians need a centralized, multilingual internet portal to provide daily updates on developments in Circassia. Such a platform, accessible in Turkish, Circassian, Arabic, English, French, German, and Ukrainian, would ensure the global community stays informed. This information flow is critical for building and maintaining international support. Unity Without Uniformity Circassians must remain united while accepting that unity does not require unanimity. Agreeing on core principles is essential, but diversity of opinion is healthy and necessary. Moscow’s security services are adept at exploiting divisions, so Circassians must be vigilant against attempts to sow discord. Preparing for Moscow’s Escalation Finally, as Circassians approach their goal of reviving their state, they must anticipate increased aggression from Moscow. The collapse of the Russian Empire this time will be more radical and may even lead to Russia’s dissolution. This prospect terrifies Moscow, making its reaction likely to be more violent and subversive. Circassians must counter this with accurate, timely information to rally international support and prevent Russian narratives from dominating the discourse. Conclusion In closing, I want to thank the organizers for allowing me, a supportive outsider, to participate in this important gathering. I look forward to the day when the International Conference on Independent Circassia (ICIC) can hold such conferences not in foreign capitals, but in a revived and flourishing Circassian state. God willing, I hope to join you all there in celebration. Thank you.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum2Bvg9t5Ng9W	2024-12-01T17:17:19-08:00	
Ukraine And Gaza: Zelensky And Netanyahu Pyrrhic Victories – OpEd	As the two wars in Ukraine and Gaza grind to a halt and uneasy peace, who are winners and losers; and what are the lessons that the world can take away from the war and aftermath. First there are no victors amongst the combatants - not military, not political or from any other summation, although so-called independent western and allied Asian media would have their readers believe otherwise. Apart from those killed fighting the wars, what is more appalling has been the impact on those directly or indirectly in the path of the rockets, missiles and other military weaponry unleashed in war and non-war zones. Ukrainians, Russians, Palestinians, Lebanese, Israelis - all are casualties, victims and losers with estimates running into several millions and still counting. * krainian-soldiers-killed-in-full-scale-war/+ 0-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f^^ =According%20to%20UN%20OCHA%20estimates,the%20number%20exceeds%201%20million.^^^ and-injuries-caused-by-the-israel-and-hamas-war/ Gaza’s Health Ministry has stated that the Palestinian real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. In Ukraine, The Economist newspaper, basing its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence reported that Ukraine and Russia lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. The paper may have been paying tribute to President Biden's credo to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. Zelensky and Netanyahu: Winners or Losers Although still lionized by US and western allies as indomitable fighters of freedom, peace and security, the two leaders of Ukraine and Israel are unlikely to be well regarded by history or even their own people. Both Volodymyr Zelensky and Benjamin Netanyahu not only failed to pursue but also spurned the offers of peace for the longest time and were insistent that they could win military victories. Their intransigence and refusal to sit at the negotiation table is now coming to an end. Zelensky will soon find that his new position, following Donald Trump’s presidential victory, is too little too late in terms of the enormity of the cost to Ukraine which has a reconstruction programme that will stretch for several decades ahead. As for Netanyahu, his repeated promise of 'war without end' and refusal to accept a Palestinian state will especially backfire on Israel's future generation if not renounced by the next Israeli leader. The Big Winners The real winners of the two wars are US and western military-industrial complexes (MIC). A report in Spanish paper, El Pais noted that the market value of the main military equipment manufacturers in the United States and Europe has skyrocketed over the past two and a half years in the wake of the two wars. This was confirmed by a study of the financial and strategic consultancy organisation, Accuracy, which analyzed the performance of the seven main U.S. companies in the industry and their European counterparts from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries (NATO). See the-value-of-major-arms-manufacturers.html Not coincidentally, NATO played a key role in the Ukraine war initially by extending its membership to former Soviet Union countries beyond what had been agreed by American and European leaders to their Russian counterparts. It has more blood on its hands in Ukraine than commonly known. Recent declassified documents dating back to 1990 reveal that security assurances against NATO expansion were made to Soviet leaders by James Baker, George Bush, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Helmut Kohl, Robert Gates, Mitterrand, Margaret Thatcher, Douglas Hurd, John Major, and Manfred Woerner. Russian leaders then were Mikhail Gorbachev and Eduard Shevardnadze (See orbachev-heard-western-leaders-early). This chapter of NATO and Russian relations following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany provides a different analysis of the origins of the war in which western leaders and media point to Russian president Vladimir Putin as the aggressor and instigator, and insist that the blame is entirely on the Russian side whilst NATO is an innocent and unwilling stake player. Following the Russian advance into Ukraine in February 2022, NATO member countries have mobilized a massive inflow of military and non military assistance to Ukraine, the intention and effect of which has been to keep Zelensky away from the negotiation table. According to the Accuracy report, the stock market capitalization of the military dependent companies - mislabeled to the public as defence companies when in fact their products are multi purpose - had increased by 59.7% from 24 February 2022, when the war in Ukraine began to March 2024. The rise is much higher than that of the benchmark stock market indexes on both sides of the Atlantic (S&P 500 and Eurostoxx 50), which in the same period recorded increases of just over 13% and 7%, respectively. U.S. companies that are winners in the market according to the report are Honeywell International, RTX Corporation, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, L3Harris and Huntington Ingalls. On the European side, the winner list of companies included France’s Safran, Dassault Aviation and Thales; the U.K.’s BAE Systems; Germany’s Rheinmetall; Italy’s Leonardo, and Norway’s Kongsberg Gruppen. According to Ignacio Lliso, a partner at Accuracy the companies they selected were those whose activity is heavily influenced by the ‘defense’ sector. The findings of the study accords with that of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) which found that global military spending in 2023 was $2,443 billion, a 6.8% increase from 2022. This was the largest increase since 2009. The average military expenditure as a share of government expenditure was 6.9% in 2023 and world military spending per person was $306, the highest since 1990. See ng-tensions-and-insecurity Pressure for new wars to feed and strengthen the MIC’s and defence companies of the world will continue unabated. All that is required are leaders such as those currently entrenched who are intent on pursuing the new cold war version of ‘freedom, peace and security’.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum92XSO3H3KkE	2024-12-01T17:05:52-08:00	
How The Philippines Is Losing Its Way – Analysis	Economic futures that were within reach in the Philippines just a few years ago are slipping away. The ongoing political noise will not affect the performance of the economy, given the government's 'sound and sustained' economic policies, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said Thursday. Unsurprisingly, NEDA Secretary Arsenio Balisacan issued the statement after meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Senate President Francis Escudero and Speaker Martin Romualdez in Malacañang. In reality, the economy is not immune to political flames. Forget BRIC-like futures 'Political noise won't slow down economy,' Balisacan pledged. 'Our economic policies, our economic policy directions are sound and sustained.' In the past year, the tensions in the Philippine political class have escalated dramatically, exploding in the past few weeks, coupled with renewed China friction and the effort to cement Manila’s way into the Indo-Pacific front. The stakes are high because such alignments have already caused massive displacement and devastation in Ukraine and Gaza and could prove far more destructive in Taiwan Straits and Southeast Asia. Judging by the headlines and debates of the political class, the primary objectives are currently political. Meanwhile, the Philippines economy is taking one hit after another. Hence, the effort to assuage constituencies that everything is fine. In reality, the post-pandemic impoverishment and runaway inflation have undermined ordinary Filipinos’ economic prospects. No BRIC-like future is viable in the Philippines as long as the country’s focus is on personal politics and geopolitics rather than on Filipino welfare and struggle against poverty. Economic growth: expectations vs. realities Early in the year, US news agency Bloomberg asked President Marcos Jr whether the Philippines could achieve an 8% growth rate. 'Why not?' the president replied. 'Yes, I think it is, I think it is doable.' Marcos expected the country to achieve up to 7% growth for 2024. Yet, the GDP year-on-year growth was only 5.2% in the third quarter of 2024. In the past three quarters, household consumption has grown only by 4.8% year-on-year; the slowest in the post-pandemic quarters. In historical view, something similar occurred last time in late 2011, over 13 years ago. Philippines GDP annual growth rate (%), 2010-2024. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority; author The slow pace was presumably due to sustained high inflation in the past 1.5 years, weak credit gains and soft growth in durable equipment. Moreover, unemployment peaked at 4.7% in July, even before the rainy season, due to lower job-creation in construction, services and agriculture. Potential for negative turns Supporting growth, investment spending reached 6% year-on-year in the first half of the year, along with net exports. The former relies on rising debt and the latter presumes a steady course. The problem is that, in the coming months, both will become more uncertain with the impending Trump trade and technology wars. Most analysts expect improved growth with easing inflation into 2025, which should provide relief to household purchasing power. However, this scenario relies on the hoped-for rate cuts and continued lower inflation rate. The two are affected by US rates and inflation; particularly due to the increasing economic dependency of the Philippines on the West and the US in particular. Philippines Interest Rate and Inflation. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority; author President-elect Trump has pledged that under his rule, 'inflation will vanish completely.' That, of course, is baloney. Trump’s policy proposals are likely to worsen inflation. Trump’s plans to impose huge tariffs on imported goods, deport millions of migrant workers and demand a voice in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies would likely send prices surging, as 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists warned back in June. Trade deficit adversities Not only has the Philippine trade deficit continued to widen, but recently it posted its largest increase in over two years. The country’s trade deficit posted a 43.4% growth in September 2024; the highest since the 81.1% growth recorded in August 2022, amid the pandemic plunge. In September, the United States (17.3%) was the country’s top trade partners, along with Hong Kong (13.9%), Japan (13.5%), and China (13.3%). China, meanwhile, was the country’s top import source, accounting for 25% of total imports in September 2024; more than twice as much as the second-ranked Indonesia or Japan. Here's the problem. As Philippine friction has dramatically accelerated with China, the country’s largest trade partner – Hong Kong/China (27%) – faces long-term risks. There are alternatives but all of them will add to rather than reduce the inherent economic costs. The spread of geopolitical friction into trade in bilateral trade would prove very costly to the Philippines because it would penalize affordable China prices and foster a return of higher costs thus contributing to inflation. Investment and tourism from China have already plunged dramatically. Also, Manila has a trade surplus with the US. Misguided trade wars and geopolitics Since most ASEAN economies are net exporters to the US, they cannot avoid consequences when Trump implements his 10%-20% tariff on imports of all goods from all countries, in addition to 60% tariff on Chinese imports. In the Philippines, additional concerns linger on heightened security risks since Manila has pledged alliance to US military ties. Such tariffs could reduce exports from non-China Asia by 3% or more. Those ASEAN members, which hope to benefit from investment if multinationals away from China, now tout their economic and geopolitical loyalty to the US. Hence, too, the recent friction between Manila and Beijing, fueled by the effort to acquire US mid-range missiles, which China calls a 'provocative.' These geopolitical calculations have turned the Philippines an outlier in the ASEAN, as evidenced by the State of Southeast Asia 2024 survey. Economic development can only be premised on peace and stability, not on missiles and geopolitics. Despite some political disagreements with China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and other ASEAN countries have successfully built their economic progress on this premise. So could the Philippines.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyumzvGzJAE9q-y	2024-12-01T16:54:34-08:00	
Controversy Has Dogged Anti-Crossover Measures In Maldives, India...	The conflict has been between the need to bring about political stability and order on the one hand, and respect the democratic freedoms of the Members of Parliament, on the other. Party cross overs have been dime a dozen in South Asian democracies. They were rampant in India in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. They were symptomatic of widespread political corruption, political instability and moral decay in society at large. India and the Maldives have passed anti-crossover or anti-defection laws to ensure political stability. India did it in 1985 and Maldives in 2024. Some democratic organizations tried to work out legislation to curb defections but failed due to vested interests blocking the efforts. But is an anti-crossover law the answer to MPs' switching sides and creating instability? Will the law work satisfactorily or has it worked satisfactorily? Opinion in Maldives and India is divided, with some saying it ensures stability and some saying it only curbs MPs' democratic rights and promotes inner party dictatorship. Maldives The Maldivian government led by President Mohamed Muizzu recently got the Majlis or parliament, to pass an anti-crossover or anti-defection law to ensure political stability in parliament and strengthen loyalty to political parties which had put up candidates and got them elected. Parliament amended Article 73 of the Maldivian constitution, to make MPs lose their seats if they defected to another party or were expelled from their party. Previously, MPs ditching their parties were only expected to resign. There was no word about what would happen if they refused to resign. Under the amended rules, however, ouster from parliament will be automatic. The Maldivian parliament also passed the State's Debt Bill and the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, in line with the recommendations of parliament's Public Accounts Committee. Another new measure was the centralization of the planning of development schemes so that there could be coordinated development. The constitutional amendments also included prior parliamentary approval for the use of Maldivian territory by foreign nationals for military purposes. Justifying these measures President Mohamed Muizzu said: 'These amendments are critical decisions made for the sake of the people in order to safeguard the country's independence, sovereignty, development and stability. These decisions were made by the honourable members of the People's Majlis (parliament) with patriotic fervour and in the national interest.' Opposition Goes to Court However, the Maldives opposition cried foul on the amendments. It moved the Supreme Court on the matter and the court agreed to hear the case. On November 24, former member of parliament, Ali Hussain, petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down the anti-defection rules as unconstitutional. He said that the amendments conflicted with constitutional provisions on fundamental rights and the functions and privileges of MPs. The Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) and another party, The Democrats, joined the case as third parties. They said that the amendments eroded constitutional supremacy, deprived the people of their right to elect representatives, and violated basic democratic principles and legislative precedents. According to The Diplomat, the anti-defection rules allow parties to enforce their 'whip' with the threat of expulsion from the parliament seat. It was also pointed out that the measures were passed in a frightful hurry. On November 20, President Muizzu's People's National Congress (PNC) used its 75-seat supermajority in the 93-member Majlis to insert the new provisions into the constitution. The government-sponsored legislation was submitted late on November 19, taken up by parliament the following morning, and pushed through in less than nine hours. President Muizzu ratified the bill on the same day. Local rights groups led by anti-corruption NGO Transparency Maldives, expressed grave concern over 'a marked absence of transparency in the unprecedented amendment process, inadequate procedural safeguard mechanisms, and the potential erosion of fundamental democratic principles.' The rights groups condemned 'the lack of proper review, informed debate and public consultation in the rushed legislative process. ' They further said: 'The anti-defection provisions undermine the foundational democratic principle of representative choice and constrain the political independence of parliamentarians.' To avoid losing their seats, lawmakers would be compelled to vote as instructed by their parties regardless of personal objections or the interests of constituents, the rights groups' joint statement explained. 'Such centralization of control would weaken internal party democracy and effectively subordinate the autonomy of elected representatives,' it added. Rights activists also said that vesting the power to formulate national development policies solely with the President 'undercuts the mandate of local councils to make development plans in close consultation with the public.' India's Experience with Anti-Crossover Law India passed its Anti-Defection law in 1985. However, it has not proved to be useful though Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who authored it, had the noblest of intentions in introducing it. He wanted to prevent crazy and unprincipled cross overs for power and pelf, destroying the party system on which parliamentary democracy rested. An assessment of the working of the law published recently in Indian Express said that the anti-defection promoted the dictatorship of the party leadership, especially its General Secretary. It restricted the legislators' freedom of speech by making MPs accountable to party leaders (or the party line) rather than to their constituents, thereby challenging the essence of representative democracy. The Indian anti-defection law discriminated against independent members, who were elected by the people by immediately disqualifying them if they joined a political party. In contrast, nominated members were given a six-month grace period, it was pointed out. The Indian Express said that the law needed a set timeline for resolving defection cases. These cases took years to be decided thus nullifying the law. The Indian law also allowed large-group defections, fostering opportunistic mergers and 'horse-trading', destabilising the political system. It banned only individual defections. In other words, the law disallowed 'retail' defections but allowed 'wholesale' defections! Additionally, it failed to address the root causes of political misbehaviour like corruption and electoral malpractices. It did not deter parties from accepting defectors. All these issues had prompted calls for revising the law to balance party discipline and political stability with individual rights and the imperatives of democracy. Debate on the constitutional amendments took place amid protests by supporters of the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) outside parliament. Proposals by the MDP to conduct a consultation process and to hold public referendums on dismissing lawmakers were flatly rejected the protesters said. A Maldivian media outlet Adhadhu, alleged that the sudden changes made by the government followed 'rumours that some MPs of the ruling Peoples' National Congress (PNC) were planning to leave the party after the High Court was petitioned to quash part of the Anti-Defection Act that requires MPs to resign for floor crossing.' Sri Lanka Defections from one party to another had been common in Sri Lanka but still there is no anti-defection law as such. This is because increasing a parliamentary party's clout through defections has been an acceptable practice with no great stigma accruing. However, political parties which had lost members to the ruling party, had gone to court to nullify the defections. But these have not borne fruit always. Unlike in the Maldives and India, in Sri Lanka, an MP who defects does not lose his seat, but he can be expelled from the party he had belonged to, and someone else from the party list could be appointed in his place. But this could be challenged in court on the grounds that the expulsion was not done through due procedure and in a democratic manner. For example, an inquiry might not have been held. But Sri Lankan courts have overwhelmingly held expulsions to be invalid on various grounds. In 2023, Sunday Times editorially suggested enacting an Anti-Defection Law, saying: 'The reality has been that defections are rarely based on conscience and largely engineered in today's political context by crude monetary gains or political agendas. That must be stopped forthwith. But how? A Government always has an advantage in that it has plums to dangle to bait opposition MPs. The traffic in defections is usually one-way.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum7w0etrt4Eps	2024-12-01T16:48:48-08:00	
Biden To Spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, His Legacy To Counte...	By Patsy Widakuswara When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola on Wednesday, he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s strategy to counter China’s clout in global development. The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in its second phase, to Zambia. Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in 2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S. congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned. China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals, including 76% of its cobalt. The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters. The PGI’s investments will 'amplify the impact of that infrastructure' with projects such as developing solar energy, local electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said. The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt. The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans, backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following three decades of civil war that ended in 2002. PGI to counter BRI Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa, Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and seven regional institutions. From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis, while the U.S. provided $76 billion. The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure financing models that are 'often opaque, fail to uphold environmental and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries worse off.' That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito is 'the first and the most developed' project in that effort, said Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 'That's the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other projects,' Schneidman told VOA. The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in the Philippines. In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon, the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as semiconductors. The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors. 'We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a part of the larger G7,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA during a briefing last month. 'And that’s not just been for two corridors,' he said. 'That’s been for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.' US-Africa strategy In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy that 'reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security interests,' the strategy says. Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years. 'We are overdelivering on that thus far,' Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a briefing Tuesday. 'We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.' But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is 'visible to the average African that says the United States financed that in the way that the Chinese do,' said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is the 'one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’' On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s a start. Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese financing. 'We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the process,' said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of Angola. So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but they are ready to ensure that local communities can 'share as much as possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,' he told VOA. Will it continue? President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his first administration. In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards. They were aware that infrastructure investments needed 'to foster economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests globally when competing with China,' said Joseph Lemoine, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center. 'I'm hopeful that they will continue those efforts,' he told VOA. Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity. DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2 billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump administration's Abraham Accords and recognize Israel. 'If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy that's transactional,' Schneidman at Brookings said. Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China. Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that developing nations can leverage.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum0i83i92uZvE	2024-12-01T16:41:18-08:00	
UN Officials Raise Alarm Over Escalating Violence In Northwest Sy...	By Vibhu Mishra A sharp escalation in fighting in Syria’s Aleppo Governorate has displaced thousands and caused heavy civilian casualties, prompting urgent warnings from senior UN officials about the growing humanitarian crisis and threat to regional stability. The alarm comes amid a sharp escalation in fighting in the Aleppo Governorate, spreading to parts of Idleb and Hama governorates and leaving the situation volatile and unpredictable. In a statement on Sunday, UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir O. Pedersen expressed grave concerns over the dramatic shift in frontlines, including advances by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Security Council-designated terrorist group, and intensified government airstrikes. 'In a country torn by nearly 14 years of war and conflict, the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international peace and security,' he said. He stressed the urgent need to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, calling on all parties to uphold international law. 'What we see in Syria today is a mark of a collective failure to bring about what has plainly been required now for many years – a genuine political process to implement Security Council resolution 2254 (2015),' Mr. Pedersen added. Humanitarian crisis deepens Meanwhile, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria Adam Abdelmoula underscored the dire humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, where violence since November 27 has claimed civilian lives, including women and children, displaced families, and disrupted essential services. Describing the situation as 'tragic', he urged all parties to the conflict to immediately cease hostilities and to prioritise the protection of civilians, including the safety of aid workers. 'The people of Syria must not endure more suffering, and we urge dialogue to be given an opportunity,' he said. Thousands flee violence According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the violence in Aleppo has forced thousands to flee, many seeking refuge in unsafe open areas. The key M-5 Damascus-Aleppo Highway is inaccessible between Saraqab City (Idleb) and Aleppo. Curfews were imposed in Aleppo City on Friday and Saturday, and all public facilities, including universities and schools, have been suspended. Hospitals are said to be overwhelmed with injured individuals, while banks and automated teller machines (ATMs) running out of cash. 'This recent escalation of hostilities is coming at a time when countless people, many of whom have already endured the trauma of displacement, are now forced to flee once more, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods,' Mr. Abdelmoula said. He also highlighted the severity of the long-running crisis, noting that prior to the influx of more than half a million returnees and refugees from Lebanon since September, over 16.7 million people were already in need of humanitarian assistance. 'This latest violence adds even more lives that now need to be urgently saved,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum9yVu7n0dbzF	2024-12-01T16:36:01-08:00	
Georgia: Fresh Protests Erupt As Demonstrators Block Public Broad...	(RFE/RL) -- Georgia's prime minister has said President Salome Zurabishvili must leave office at the end of her term later this month, despite her pledge not to, while anti-government protesters -- who are supported by Zurabishvili -- took to the streets again, scuffling with security forces at key sites in the capital. Demonstrators gathered on December 1 in the courtyard of the Channel 1 public broadcaster, blocking the entrance and vowing to stay until leaders of the organization resign. Protesters also demanded the broadcaster report on the demonstrations of the pro-European groups as they stand opposed to the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream-led government. Channel 1 said in a statement that 'viewers are watching the unprecedented pressure' on its journalists. 'Channel 1 was and will remain free and will defend editorial independence despite any pressure,' it said. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries at that site or near the parliament building, but video by Current Time showed large crowds of protesters and security personnel facing off, with water cannons and tear gas being fired. The Interior Ministry warned 'the aggressive participants of the rally to stop illegal activities, otherwise the ministry will take appropriate measures granted by law.' It also warned parents to keep their children away from the 'violent environment.' Shortly thereafter, police began moving protesters away from the parliament building and erected barricades. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's comments earlier in the day set up a showdown with Zurabishvili, a day after she called the newly elected parliament illegitimate and vowed to remain as president. Demonstrations in the capital, Tbilisi, have turned increasingly chaotic and violent. Georgia has plunged deeper into a political crisis that started in late October, when the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in parliamentary elections. The opposition said the vote was marred by fraud. Western countries have called for an investigation.Thousands of demonstrators had returned to the streets of Tbilisi on November 30 for a third night to protest against the government's decision to suspend accession talks with the European Union.In central Tbilisi, police fired tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators, some of whom chanted 'traitors' and held photographs of journalists who they say were beaten by police. Demonstrators have erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue. More than 200 people have been arrested in the past three days, officials said.Zurabishvili, who has allied herself with pro-European opposition, asserted that parliament does not have the right to choose her successor following the end of her term in December and she vowed to remain in office. 'There is no legitimate parliament, and therefore, an illegitimate parliament cannot elect a new president,' she said on November 30. 'Thus, no inauguration can take place, and my mandate continues until a legitimately elected parliament is formed,' she saidOn December 1, Kobakhidze dismissed her pledge, saying she would have to leave the office.Kobakhidze also dismissed the United States' announcement that it would suspend its strategic partnership with Georgia. Calling it a 'temporary event,' he said his government would talk to the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump when it takes office in January.Kobakhidze also accused opponents of the halt to EU talks of plotting a revolt, along the lines of Ukraine's 2014 Euromaidan protests. Sparked by the president's decision to spurn closer ties with the EU, months of protests in Kyiv culminated that February in violent street clashes. The president, Viktor Yanukovych, later fled the country.'Some people want a repeat of that scenario in Georgia,' he said. 'But there will be no Maidan in Georgia.'A State Department spokesman criticized the decision to suspend EU talks, saying it 'made Georgia more vulnerable to the Kremlin.' 'The United States condemns the excessive use of force by police against Georgians seeking to exercise their rights to assembly and expression, including their freedom to peacefully protest,' Matthew Miller said in a statement. U.S. authorities have sought to pressure Georgian officials, imposing sanctions on dozens of government officials whom Washington said had 'undermined' democracy and human rights in the country.The European Union's new foreign policy chief warned Georgian authorities over violence against demonstrators.'It is clear that using violence against peaceful protesters is not acceptable, and the Georgian government should respect the will of the Georgian people,' Kaja Kallas told journalists during a trip to Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyumyOmzdtD1u__	2024-12-01T16:29:58-08:00	
US Needs To Rethink Its Approach To Central Asia – Analysis	By Luke Coffey The foreign policy in-tray for the incoming Trump administration is filled to the brim. As Donald Trump nominates his Cabinet and prepares to reenter the Oval Office in January, major foreign policy issues demand attention. One region that must not be overlooked is Central Asia, an area that holds significant geopolitical and economic importance.The five Central Asian republics — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — are located at the heart of the Eurasian landmass. Since gaining independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union’s collapse, they have gradually developed unique foreign policies and national identities. Strategically situated at a historic crossroads for trade and transit, Central Asia has played an essential role in Eurasian commerce for thousands of years. The region, especially near the Caspian Sea, is also rich in natural resources, offering substantial economic potential.Despite its importance, US policymakers often overlook Central Asia. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the US improved relations with some Central Asian states due to military operations in Afghanistan. However, as US interests in Afghanistan diminished, so did engagement with the broader region. No sitting US president has ever visited Central Asia and only a handful of Cabinet-level visits have taken place. This lack of high-level attention signals a broader disengagement, which could undermine US strategic interests.Another issue is America’s approach to the region, which often prioritizes human rights and democratization over other critical matters, such as security, counterterrorism, energy and trade. While these values are essential, a balanced strategy is necessary to foster broader regional cooperation. The overemphasis on political reform has often alienated Central Asian governments, resulting in a lopsided relationship that fails to address mutual strategic interests effectively.In today’s era of great power competition, crafting a coherent US strategy for Central Asia is vital. The last US strategy for the region, published in February 2020, emerged during Trump’s first term. Though initially well-regarded, it is now outdated. The 2020 strategy focused on Afghanistan’s role in regional dynamics, an approach less relevant now since the US withdrawal and the Taliban’s return to power. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine have reshaped geopolitical and economic landscapes, requiring a reassessment of US priorities in Central Asia. There is currently little clarity on how the next Trump administration will approach the region. During Trump’s first term, key Cabinet members had considerable regional experience. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, previously ExxonMobil’s CEO, spent significant time in Central Asia due to the energy sector. Similarly, former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis had extensive regional knowledge from his tenure as chief of US Central Command. However, none of Trump’s recent appointments have demonstrated expertise in Central Asia, leaving the administration’s future approach uncertain. However, a new strategy is anticipated next year and several key areas should be prioritized to strengthen US ties with the region.First, the US must support Central Asian states in balancing their foreign policies. These nations are acutely aware of their geopolitical, economic and cultural ties with regional powers, such as Russia and China. The US should avoid framing engagement as a binary choice between the West and these powers, instead fostering relationships that acknowledge regional complexities, while promoting mutual interests. Encouraging multifaceted diplomacy will enable Central Asian countries to maintain autonomy, while engaging with all major global players.Second, energy and transit cooperation should be central to US engagement. Ensuring Europe diversifies its energy resources is vital due to NATO obligations, while Central Asian countries seek to broaden their export markets and enhance connectivity. The US should explore opportunities for expanding oil and gas projects and developing new transit routes. Notably, supporting the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline, which would connect Turkmenistan’s vast natural gas reserves to European markets, should be a clear policy goal. Such initiatives would not only strengthen energy security for Europe, but also provide Central Asian countries with alternative trade routes, reducing their dependence on Russia and China.Third, security cooperation must remain a priority. The US has long collaborated with Central Asian republics on counterterrorism, particularly in addressing the threat posed by regional extremists joining groups such as Daesh. For Central Asian governments, this issue is sensitive and best handled through discreet, trust-based engagement. With the US no longer present in Afghanistan, regional security concerns have intensified. Strengthening security partnerships with Central Asian countries is crucial for countering emerging threats and maintaining regional stability.Finally, in this era of great power competition, the US must collaborate with allies to promote shared interests in Central Asia. Recognizing the growing role of the Organization of Turkic States is essential. This grouping serves as a platform for Turkic countries, including four of the five Central Asian republics, to enhance trade, energy and political cooperation. Turkiye, a key NATO member and driving force behind the Organization of Turkic States, plays a crucial role despite current tensions with the West. Engaging with Turkiye through the organization offers an avenue for the US to pursue common goals in Central Asia, while reinforcing ties with Ankara.To support this new strategy, the Washington administration must prioritize showing up in the region. Trump should become the first US president to visit Central Asia, sending a strong signal of commitment. In the meantime, high-level visits by US officials would symbolize renewed engagement. Cabinet-level visits could strengthen diplomatic ties and lay the groundwork for deeper cooperation.Central Asia remains geopolitically significant to the US, as recent developments in Afghanistan have highlighted. If the US aims to compete effectively in great power competition, it cannot afford to neglect this critical region. A pragmatic, balanced relationship rooted in mutual strategic and regional interests is essential. Trump now has a unique opportunity to reshape US engagement in Central Asia and secure a stronger American presence in this pivotal region. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Uzbekistan: Religious Communities Blocked From Using Own Building...	By Mushfig Bayram Bukhara's registered Baptist Union Church has not been able to meet publicly for worship since May 2021. After a broken water pipe caused damage, the authorities sealed the Church building. Baptists told Forum 18 that they want to rebuild the Church building, but were told that they cannot do this as the regime's Cultural Heritage Agency will allow repair work to be done only by a specialised state company. A neighbour's house collapsed at the same time, but local authorities allowed them to rebuild their own house. Bukhara City Administration 'keeps promising us that they will hand over the building to us and asked us that we sign a paper we have received 500,000 Sums [about a week's average wages] for the repair work', Baptists told Forum 18. 'We are not so naive, and did not sign any papers.' Baptists added that they think that the 'local officials may have expropriated the funds and are trying to cover it up'. Corruption has long been endemic in the country, including in relation to freedom of religion or belief violations (see below). The Head of the City Administration, Kurbon Tursunov, claimed to Forum 18 that 'we cannot give the building to the Church without the permission of the central government in Tashkent as the Church is not a state entity but a private entity.' He appeared evasive when Forum 18 asked whether the central government had been asked for permission, dropping his voice and mumbling: 'Yes we have, but maybe they have not had time to look at our request.' He then claimed that the central government will answer within a week. Officials in the Office of the Prime Minister in Tashkent did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called (see below). Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov on 24 June ordered the seizure and possible demolition of more than 400 unregistered mosques and houses, built by residents but not registered with the Justice Ministry. In mid-July 2024, a State Security Service (SSS) secret police officer and an official of the local Administration's Religious Affairs Department came to Abu Zar Mosque in Yangiyul District of Tashkent Region. They said that as the Mosque is not functioning, it will be handed over for business use. A local Muslim linked the move to the Prime Minister's reported 24 June order (see below). Abu Zar Mosque, built with state permission, functioned from the 1990s. The regime closed the mosque in 2007 and it has not functioned since then, despite campaigns by local Muslims to reopen it. When Forum 18 on 25 April pointed out to Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, that the Abu Zar Mosque was built by the mosque community who would like to pray every day in their own mosque, and that travel to other mosques can be difficult, Azomkhanov did not address those points. On 21 November he refused to speak to Forum 18 about the continued forced closure of Abu Zar Mosque (see below). Gazalkent's local Baptist Church, part of the state-registered nationwide Baptist Union, has repeatedly tried to register with the regime. However, Bostanlyk District authorities in Tashkent Region continue to refuse registration applications. 'The Church can hold meetings in the building without any interference from the authorities,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'But we would like to gain legal status so that we are not in a situation when at any time the Church could be prosecuted for the 'illegal' exercise of freedom of religion or belief.' Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, claimed not to be able to hear Forum 18 when it called him, although the line was clear. He then switched his phone to a fax machine. Bostanlyk District Administration officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called (see below). In June 2024, Baptists in Gulistan asked Syrdarya Region Architecture and Justice Departments to register a new building the congregation had built on land they own. Although the congregation has met for worship in the new building, they want registration as 'it is safer under the law to have meetings in a registered building.' However, the Regional Justice and Architecture Departments refused the application. The excuse given was that the Land Cadastre Department refused to recognise the sale of the land to the Baptists when the original landowner tried to register the sale. The mainly unoccupied building has now been damaged by vandalism, including broken windows. Repairing the damage is likely to be expensive for the congregation (see below). Sherzod Rasulov, who is responsible for the registration of religious organisations in Syrdarya Regional Justice Department, claimed to Forum 18: 'We do not have a problem to register them, but the Regional Administration and Architecture Department have not given them permission.' He then refused to discuss the issue more with Forum 18. Land Cadastre Department officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called. Irkin Muminov, Deputy Head of Syrdarya Regional Administration, refused to tell Forum 18 why his Administration refuses to register the Baptists' new church building. 'I do not know you and we have been told not to give any information over the phone,' he claimed (see below). On 25 April, two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists were ordered to be destroyed and were partially demolished. The demolition was halted after protests, but they are not being permitted to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings, local Baptists told Forum 18. Khorezm Regional Administration officials, and Zafarbek Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints) all did not answer whenever Forum 18 contacted them. So Forum 18 was unable to ask why they are refusing to give permission for the Baptists to repair the damage the regime has caused and complete the construction work (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses have made multiple attempts over many years to gain registration for their communities in Uzbekistan outside the town of Chirchik, the only place where they have a registered community. This problem exists throughout Uzbekistan, with regime officials frequently using property-based excuses to block registration applications from a variety of Muslim and non-Muslim religious communities. Such refusals cause many problems for religious communities seeking to exercise their freedom of religion or belief. The Religion Law does not allow religious communities to meet outside their registered address, and such meetings can face police raids (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses have many times sought to meet officials to discuss how to solve the problems caused by the regime's human rights violations. One such meeting was on 5 July with Dilnoza Muratova, Deputy Director of the state-controlled National Human Rights Centre. She claimed that Uzbekistan could not implement human rights obligations 'since there are no tools in Uzbek law'. Muratova did not explain why, when her state-controlled Centre was drafting the Religion Law, it was not drafted in a way that provided 'tools' to implement legally-binding human rights obligations instead of 'tools' to violate them. Forum 18 asked the Centre's Chief Specialist, Amir Khamidov, to explain this. He refused to answer, claiming: 'I need to get permission from the leadership to answer you' (see below). The grounds of the only functioning Buddhist temple in Uzbekistan, the Chaynsa (Compassion) temple in Tashkent, has long been under threat from the local authorities. In Buddhist belief this is a serious matter, as each part of a temple grounds has a sacred significance. The expansion of Tashkent's metro line was initially planned to include the demolition of the Chaynsa Temple. The Temple was not demolished, but a 12 meter wide overpass for the metro line was built 5 meters above the Temple grounds and close to the Temple itself. 'Although the noise from the metro line is not loud, a lot of dust from the line collects in the grounds and on the temple every day,' members of the Buddhist Community told Aleksei Volosevich, the editor of Asia Terra independent Tashkent news website (see below). The community wants the existing Temple to be moved to another location and reconstructed according to Buddhist beliefs. They also wanted any agreement to be made in writing and signed by the relevant officials, as well as published immediately. Contrary to their previous agreement, Zangiota District Administration has not given the Buddhist community a plot of land for a new temple and no agreement was reached at the July 2022 meeting. Tashkent Administration officials and Religious Affairs Committee officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why they have not honoured their promise to the Buddhist community to provide them with another plot of land for their Temple (see below). Bukhara Baptist Church still blocked from using its building The registered Baptist Union Church in the historical part of the south-western city of Bukhara has not been able to meet publicly for worship since May 2021. After a broken water pipe caused damage because the authorities sealed the Church building, which dates from 1971. Baptists told Forum 18 that they wanted to rebuild the Church building, but were told that they cannot do this as the regime's Cultural Heritage Agency will allow repair work to be done only by a specialised state company. A neighbour's house collapsed at the same time, but local authorities allowed them to rebuild their own house. 'We asked the authorities to allow us to repair the new building, since they are not doing anything with it now, or allow us to construct a new building in the place of our sealed building,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'But they refused both our proposals.' Sukhrob Ochilov, Head of the Heritage Department's Bukhara regional division, wrote to the Church's pastor in July 2024, claiming the Department was not competent to remove the church building from the heritage register to allow it to be rebuilt. Ochilov declined to talk to Forum 18. Officials in 2024 appear to have changed their attitude to church members. 'Last year [2023] at least they were listening to us and promising that they will help us. Now some officials tell us directly to our face: Leave my office and get lost!' local Baptists told Forum 18. They did not want to identify these officials, for fear of state reprisals Since May 2021 the Church has been meeting privately in members' homes and renting public buildings, Bukhara Baptists told Forum 18 on 19 November. Bukhara City Administration was allocated funds by the government to repair a building offered to the Baptists, but has not begun the repairs, Baptists told Forum 18. Bukhara City Administration 'keeps promising us that they will hand over the building to us and asked us that we sign a paper we have received 500,000 Sums [about a week's average wages] for the repair work,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'We are not so naive, and did not sign any papers.' Baptists added that they think that the 'local officials may have expropriated the funds and are trying to cover it up.' Corruption has long been endemic in the country, including in relation to freedom of religion or belief violations. Many are reluctant to discuss corruption as a factor in the human rights violations they experience, yet there appears to be a strong connection between human rights violations and corruption. Nozim Nurov, Deputy Head of Bukhara City Administration, claimed to Forum 18 on 19 November that 'We cannot resume work on the building since there are some legal issues our administration's lawyers are working on.' He then declined to talk further. The Head of the City Administration, Kurbon Tursunov who was appointed on 1 May, claimed to Forum 18 on 19 November that 'we cannot give the building to the Church without the permission of the central government in Tashkent as the Church is not a state entity but a private entity.' He appeared to be evasive when Forum 18 asked whether the central government had been asked for permission, dropping his voice and mumbling: 'Yes we have, but maybe they have not had time to look at our request.' He then claimed that the central government will answer within a week. Officials in the Office of Prime Minister in Tashkent did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Tashkent Region's Abu Zar Mosque still closed Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov on 24 June ordered the seizure and possible demolition of more than 400 unregistered mosques and houses, built by residents but not registered with the Justice Ministry. Prime Minister Aripov has long been hostile – like the regime – to Muslims exercising their freedom of religion or belief outside state control. In September 2023, he is reported to have warned state officials not to attend mosques. Officials in the Office of Prime Minister did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Religious Affairs Committeeofficials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why the regime has ordered the demolition of unregistered mosques. In mid-July 2024, a State Security Service (SSS) secret police officer and an official of the local Administration's Religious Affairs Department came to Abu Zar Mosque in Yangiyul District of Tashkent Region. They said that as the Mosque is not functioning, it will be handed over for business use. A local Muslim linked the move to the Prime Minister's reported 24 June order that unregistered Mosques should be demolished or handed over for business use. 'They just came, brazenly told us this and said that no one from the mahalla [local district] should get angry about it,' a local Muslim who asked not to be identified for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Abu Zar Mosque, built with state permission, functioned from the 1990s. The regime closed the mosque in 2007 and it has not functioned since then, despite campaigns by local Muslims to reopen it. 'Mahalla residents have actively tried to register it since 2017, going to all state agencies,' the Muslim said. 'Finally, in 2022 officials promised us that it would soon be re-opened. A full-scale renovation then took place. Now they are acting like this – I don't even know what to call it.' The regime has a long-standing policy of blocking state registration attempts by Shia and Sunni Muslim, Protestant, Catholic, Jehovah's Witness, and other religious communities, making it impossible for them to meet legally. Often the excuses used are property-related, with officials taking full advantage of the opportunities provided to them by the Religion Law for arbitrary and inconsistent actions. This has continued in 2024. Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, defended the regime's blocking of the Abu Zar Mosque community's registration attempts. 'There are very large mosques in the areas where Muslims can pray, and they can attend those,' he claimed to Forum 18 on 25 April. 'Those Mosques also have convenient parking places for private cars. Why don't they just attend those Mosques?' When Forum 18 pointed out that the Abu Zar Mosque was built by the mosque community who would like to pray every day in their own mosque, and that travel to other mosques can be difficult, Azomkhanov did not address those points. On 21 November he refused to speak to Forum 18 about the continued forced closure of the Abu Zar Mosque. Gazalkent Baptist Church repeatedly denied state registration The local Baptist Church in Gazalkent in Bostanlyk District of Tashkent Region, which is part of the state-registered nationwide Baptist Union, has repeatedly tried to re-register with the regime after the 1999 Religion Law imposed compulsory re-registration on religious communities. The 2021 Religion Law continues to impose a burdensome and arbitrary registration procedure, which violates the regime's legally-binding international human rights obligations. However, Bostanlyk District authorities continue to refuse registration applications, Baptists who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 on 19 November 2024. 'The Church can hold meetings in the building without any interference from the authorities,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'But we would like to gain legal status so that we are not in a situation when at any time the Church could be prosecuted for the 'illegal' exercise of freedom of religion or belief.' Bostanlyk District Administration first refused a registration application in May 2000, alleging that registering a non-Baptist Protestant church in the District had caused riots. The Baptists had not heard of these alleged riots in their District, and the regime did not substantiate these claims with evidence. 'The District Administration then told Gazalkent Baptists to attend the Russian Orthodox Church instead.' Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, claimed on 21 November not to be able to hear Forum 18 when it called him, although the line was clear. He then switched his phone to a fax machine. Bostanlyk District Administration officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why the regime continues to, against its legally-binding international human rights obligations, obstruct state registration attempts and ban the unregistered exercise of freedom of religion or belief. Gulistan Baptist Church repeatedly denied state registration Regime officials in Syrdarya Region south-west of Tashkent refused in 2019 to register a local Baptist Union congregation in Gulistan, local Baptists who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals have told Forum 18. The congregation eventually gained state registration, but 'the registered address where we meet for worship is very small place, a 15 square meter room in a private house which does not have space for all our members,' local Baptists explained to Forum 18. In June 2024 the Baptists asked Syrdarya Region Architecture and Justice Departments to register a new building the congregation had built on land they own. Although the congregation has met for worship in the new building, they want registration as 'it is safer under the law to have meetings in a registered building'. However, the Regional Justice and Architecture Departments refused the application. The excuse given was that the Land Cadastre (Registry) Department refused to recognise the sale of the land to the Baptists when the original landowner tried to register the sale. In 2019 the absence of a document from the Land Cadastre (Registry) Department was one of the excuses used to refuse a registration application. The mainly unoccupied building has now been damaged by vandalism, including broken windows. Repairing the damage is likely to be expensive for the congregation. Sherzod Rasulov, who is responsible for the registration of religious organisations in Syrdarya Regional Justice Department, claimed to Forum 18 on 20 November 2024: 'We do not have a problem to register them, but the Regional Administration and Architecture Department have not given them permission.' He then refused to discuss the issue more with Forum 18. Land Cadastre (Registry) Department officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Irkin Muminov, Deputy Head of Syrdarya Regional Administration, refused to say why his Administration refuses to register the Baptists' new church building. 'I do not know you and we have been told not to give any information over the phone,' he claimed to Forum 18 on 20 November. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Urgench Baptist Church demolition stopped, church still not allowed to build On 25 April, Judge Nurlubay Akimniyazov ordered the destruction of two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists. The decision, which against Uzbek law the Baptists had not seen, entered into force on 27 May. Demolition began on 30 July. One of the buildings was intended to be a church. The Judge, regime officials, and state-appointed Muslim clerics involved in the destruction have either refused to explain the demolition order or given contradictory explanations, and officials have stated they are 'determined to complete the demolition sooner or later'. Council of Churches Baptists do not seek state permission to exercise freedom of religion or belief, and normally meet for worship in homes owned by church members. Under Uzbekistan's legally-binding international human rights obligations, the Baptists have the right to exercise their freedom of religion or belief in these ways, as the OSCE / Council of Europe Venice Commission Guidelines on the Legal Personality of Religious or Belief Communities note. The demolition stopped after the Baptists complained. However, officials do not allow them to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings. 'We are waiting for the regional authorities to give us permission to go ahead with the construction,' local Baptists told Forum 18 on 21 November. Khorezm Regional Administration officials, Zafarbek Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints) all did not answer whenever Forum 18 contacted them between 21 and 25 November. So Forum 18 was not able to ask them why they are refusing to give permission for the Baptists to repair the damage the regime has caused and complete the construction work. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Jehovah's Witness registration attempts still blocked Jehovah's Witnesses have made multiple attempts over many years to gain registration for their communities in Uzbekistan outside the town of Chirchik, the only place where they have a registered community. 'Each time the communities faced insurmountable obstacles from state authorities,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18 in June 2023. This problem exists throughout Uzbekistan, with regime officials very frequently using property-based excuses to block registration applications from a variety of Muslim and non-Muslim religious communities. 'The Religion Law gives the authorities unlimited powers to refuse our registration, to our regret,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18 in April 2024. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why the regime continues to, against its legally-binding international human rights obligations, obstruct state registration attempts and ban the unregistered exercise of freedom of religion or belief. Such refusals cause many problems for religious communities seeking to exercise their freedom of religion or belief. For example, the Religion Law does not allow religious communities to meet outside their registered address, and such meetings can face police raids. In March 2024, Navoi Police raided the local Jehovah's Witnesses' commemoration of the Memorial of Jesus' Death – the most important annual event for Jehovah's Witnesses. Five police officers between 07.00 am and 09.30 'pounded on the door and windows of the flat'. The head of Navoi Police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department', Yusufbek Ismoilov, refused to explain to Forum 18 on 26 November why his officers raided the meeting, claiming that he could not hear well. The Jehovah's Witness community in the capital Tashkent has long tried to gain state registration – so far in vain. During the latest registration attempt in 2024, Tashkent City Administration refused an application for a building to be designated as the Tashkent community's legal address. Such an address is necessary for a state registration application. The regime claimed that urban planning construction regulations prevented the building from being the community's legal address, and that 'a number of [unspecified] neighbours of the Jehovah's Witnesses in their mahalla [local district] had in the [unspecified] past made [unspecified] complaints against the community.' On 6 February, Judge Olimjan Shamsiyev of Tashkent Inter-District Administrative Court rejected the Jehovah's Witnesses complaint against the decision. He claimed that as local authorities have 'discretionary powers' to refuse a request to use a building as their legal address, 'the contested decision cannot be considered illegal'. Shamsiyev also defended the use of alleged 'complaints' by unspecified 'neighbours' as a reason for Tashkent Administration to reject the Jehovah's Witness application. He refused on 23 April to discuss his claims with Forum 18, or to explain what religious communities could do when faced with arbitrary regime decisions. Jehovah's Witnesses have many times sought to meet officials to discuss how to solve the problems caused by the regime's human rights violations. One such meeting was on 5 July with Dilnoza Muratova, Deputy Director of the state-controlled National Human Rights Centre. Muratova claimed that Uzbekistan could not implement United Nations Human Rights Committee Concluding Observations (such as those from May 2020) 'since there are no tools in Uzbek law'. Uzbekistan ratified both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its Optional Protocol (OP1) (under which individual complaints are made) in 1995. By voluntarily doing this, Uzbekistan took on both the binding international human rights law obligations of the ICCPR, and the obligation to correct any violations of its obligations – such as violations found by the UN Human Rights Committee. Muratova did not explain why, when her state-controlled Centre was drafting the Religion Law, it was not drafted in a way that provided 'tools' to implement human rights obligations instead of 'tools' to violate them. On 26 November 2024, Forum 18 asked the Centre's Chief Specialist, Amir Khamidov, to explain this. He refused to answer. 'I need to get permission from the leadership to answer you,' he claimed. He could not specify when he might get permission and then refused to talk more to Forum 18. Will Tashkent officials honour their promise to the Buddhist community? The grounds of the only functioning Buddhist temple in Uzbekistan, the Chaynsa (Compassion) temple in Tashkent, has long been under threat from the local authorities. In 2018, Zangiota District Administration wanted to seize most of the temple grounds to expand a road. In Buddhist belief this is a serious matter, as each part of a temple grounds has a sacred significance. A compromise was eventually reached, Cabar news agency reported on 30 January 2019, under which a plot of land of equivalent size will be given to the Buddhist community to build a new temple. However, the expansion of the Circle Line of Tashkent's metro was initially planned to include the demolition of the Chaynsa Temple. The Temple was not demolished, but in early 2023 a 12 meter wide overpass for the metro line was built 5 meters above the Temple grounds and close to the Temple itself. 'Although the noise from the metro line is not loud, a lot of dust from the line collects in the grounds and on the temple every day,' members of the Buddhist Community told Aleksei Volosevich, the editor of Asia Terra independent Tashkent news website, in November 2024. Aleksandr Kheqay of the Buddhist community on 13 July 2022 met a Religious Affairs Committee official and Almardon Karshiyev, head of Tashkent City Administration's section responsible for work with religious organisations, to discuss the relocation of the Temple. The community wanted the existing Temple to be not demolished, but moved to another location and reconstructed according to Buddhist beliefs. They also wanted any agreement to be made in writing and signed by relevant officials, as well as published immediately. Contrary to their previous agreement, Zangiota District Administration has not given the Buddhist community a plot of land for a new temple and no agreement was reached at the July 2022 meeting. Tashkent Administration officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November 2024. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why they have not honoured their promise to the Buddhist community to provide them with another plot of land for their Temple.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum2ZUeETBuXim	2024-12-01T16:21:07-08:00	
Reaching The Unreached To Find Missing TB Cases – OpEd	Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has,' had said the famous anthropologist, Margaret Mead. Imbibing these values, a small group of people in India and Philippines have changed the lives of many people affected by tuberculosis (TB) – especially those who were being missed or left behind by public services. TB, despite being preventable and curable, continues to be the deadliest of infectious diseases in high TB burden countries. In 2023 TB infected 10.8 million people and killed 1.25 million people worldwide. Globally almost a third of people who get active TB disease every year are missed. The number of people with TB who are missed in high burden settings (almost all in the Global South) is alarmingly higher than the global average. More worryingly, we also miss TB among those who take a TB test. Almost half of those who get a TB test worldwide, are tested through sputum microscopy – an outdated test that underperforms and is likely to miss finding TB in around half of those who take this test. But when we see the numbers in high burden settings, use of underperforming microscopy is higher. For example, in India - a country with highest TB burden worldwide - as per India TB Report 2024, 79% of TB tests in 2023 were done using the underperforming microscopy (which misses around half of them). That is why the World Health Organization (WHO) had called upon in 2018 to replace all microscopy with upfront molecular testing by 2027. Selfless doctor on a #HealthForAll mission in Philippines In multiple islets of Bantayan in the northernmost part of Cebu, Philippines, only around one-third of the estimated TB cases could be notified before the pandemic. But after the introduction of new TB screening and diagnostic tools, now almost all the TB (99%) is found in 2024. Bantayan has 25 barangays (small townships) and one district hospital which is understaffed and undersupplied. These areas are also marked as geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA). Pump boats are the main form of transportation here. Most of the residents there are fisherfolk or farmers and their income is a humble 300-350 Pesos (USD 6-7) a day. Using latest and state-of-the-art TB screening and diagnostic tools in the Philippines was made possible in 2022 through the Introducing New Tools Project (iNTP) of the Stop TB Partnership, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and FHI360. These new diagnostic tools included computer and artificial intelligence aided ultraportable handheld X-ray machines of Fujifilm (to screen for TB) and point-of-care, laboratory independent and decentralised WHO-recommended molecular test Truenat of Molbio Diagnostics (to diagnose TB). Both, Truenat and ultraportable X-ray machines, are battery operated, and can be deployed at point of need, even in remote and hard to reach areas like the Bantayan islets. When these new tools were deployed in Bantayan islets, new TB case notifications, as well as treatment success rate, increased manifold. But the journey was not easy. Braving inclement weather and carrying these new innovative diagnostic tools for TB in moulded plastic tubs, Dr Samantha Tinsay, the Municipal Health Officer of Bantayan, leads her team from islet to islet on pump boats, to screen and diagnose people with TB. She was speaking at a session in the world's largest TB and lung disease conference this year (Union World Conference on Lung Health in Indonesia 2024). Her untiring efforts have resulted in a tremendous increase in TB case finding: the number of persons screened for presumptive TB went up from 187 (in 2019) to 2506 (in 2022), 2027 (in 2023), and 5679 people in 2024. The target for presumptive TB screening for 2024 was set at 2248 people, but Dr Samantha's team has already screened 253% more than the target this year. Before the pandemic, 187 people with active TB diseases were found (39% of the estimated cases). After introduction of new TB screening and diagnostic tools, Dr Samantha's team found 458 people with TB in 2022, 341 in 2023 and 394 in 2024 so far. Before the pandemic, 39% of estimated TB cases were found but after introduction of new tools, 99% of estimated TB cases are found by Dr Samantha and team. All people found with TB were linked to TB treatment on the same day. 'TB treatment success rate has also increased to 97% in 2023,' she confirmed. Average TB treatment success rate in the Philippines was 78% in 2023 as per the WHO Global TB Report 2024. Imagine the difference it can make in the Philippines' response to end TB if such interventions can be scaled up and become a norm. As per the latest WHO Global TB Report 2024, out of the estimated 739,000 people with TB in the Philippines, around 77% (575,800) were notified to the national programme, and over 37,000 lives were lost due to TB in 2023. Also, only 65% of those reached, got a WHO recommended molecular test diagnosis. 'When the going gets tough, the tough gets going' When Dr Samantha Tinsay embarked on her journey to find TB with new tools in September 2022, extreme climate events- such as typhoons and storms- compounded the challenge. But it was sheer determination on her and her team's part to hop on a pump boat and brave the storms and typhoons to go from islet to islet and find TB, treat TB and prevent TB. The X-ray and Truenat molecular test were brought to the Bantayan Rural Health Unit and packed in a suitcase with wheels for transportation. Both these machines fitted well in a moulded plastic tub and were transported via pump boats. On 29 October 2022, Tropical Storm Nalgae, locally known as Paeng, hit the Philippines, and affected around 4.8 million people within a week. On that fateful day, Dr Samantha Tinsay and her team were enroute to one of the islets with the diagnostics tools in tow. 'As we were out of the range of mobile signal, we did not know that a storm signal had been raised, and that nobody should be travelling or working. Nevertheless, rain or sunshine, we were working and could not have stopped as patients were already waiting for us at the clinic,' said the spirited Tinsay. Integrated healthcare 'We bundle a lot other health services, and not just focus on TB', says Dr Samantha. Her team delivers a range of healthcare services when they go from islet to islet, such as HIV testing, hepatitis testing, dental, laboratory and diagnostics, psychiatric, psychological and mental healthcare services, among others. Those with TB, HIV or hepatitis, are linked to treatment care and support on the same day. Dr Samantha is also leveraging technology, an example of which is the setting up of a Starlink (a satellite constellation system that provides satellite-based internet service) in the middle of a basketball court. In recognition of her efforts to strengthen local health systems, Municipality of Bantayan received three Awards- (i) Excellence in Newborn Screening, (ii) Andres Bonifacio Award, and (iii) Nominee, Best in Local Health Systems- in November 2024. Making a difference where it is needed most: Reaching the homeless and migrant people with TB services CNS team has met and listened to the intense journeys of almost a 100 homeless people, unauthorised slum dwellers, and migrants who could only access TB services (and get cured) because of a novel initiative implemented by Humana People to People India. Despite living in the proximity of the best of TB and healthcare facilities in major metropolitan cities of India, homeless and migrant people often slip on the blindspot. Poor and congested living conditions, alcoholism, tobacco smoking, stigma and comorbidities (such as malnutrition and chronic lung diseases) increase their TB risk. Lisbeth Aarup, Programme Head, Humana People to People India said that her team developed a model called LEAD (Leveraging, Engaging, Advocating for Disruption of TB transmission). Its first phase was implemented in 2023-2024 in 4 cities of India: Delhi, Hyderabad, Howrah and peri-urban Mumbai. LEAD was supported by USAID, JSI India, and Government of India's National TB Elimination Programme. Lisbeth's team at Humana had trained several frontline healthcare workers (mostly women) who worked with a range of experts to help support homeless people and migrants access existing public healthcare services (as well as some private or non-profit healthcare facilities, for instance for x-rays, nutrition support, etc). Lisbeth was speaking at a session at Union World Conference on Lung Health 2024 in Indonesia. Humana helped those most in need (and most likely to be left behind) to access health and social support services with dignity and rights. Standard quality TB screening and diagnostics, treatments, care and support became accessible to those who could not even get a TB test earlier. Diagnostic delays and catastrophic costs often go in tandem and get more pronounced in marginalised populations. Humana's entire team deserves a salute for their dedication in ensuring that a person is supported in every possible way in his/ her/ their journey from TB diagnosis to cure. With those CNS could speak to, a lot of them (after completing their treatment) were actively involved as TB survivors, championing the cause of helping support the drive to raise awareness, dispel myths and misconceptions, find more TB, and help support them through the treatment. No wonder 'lost- to- follow up' (when people drop off from care and are unable to complete treatment) was almost negligible. This stands out because of two reasons: one, none of them would have been reached with TB services sans approaches on line with Humana model, and second, risk of left to follow up would have been probably the highest amongst them! Thank you Humana. Humana's team also leveraged upon new technologies, such as artificial intelligence aided cough sound-based TB screening app, as well an upfront x-ray to screen those with presumptive TB. 'During the last year we have reached out to more than 150,000 people,' said Lisbeth Aarup of Humana. 'We should test the people who do not have symptoms because in the slums where we have many homeless people and migrants, we find people with TB too late. We should have found them long before!' Lisbeth is right: if we find people with TB when they are asymptomatic and link them to effective treatment, we can stop the spread of pulmonary TB. Breaking the chain of transmission is key if we are to end TB. Learning from experience, Lisbeth's team goes to the people when they are more likely to be available (early morning, evening or night). Along with LEAD, Humana People to People India is also implementing Project SWEET (Street Women Empowered and Engaged to Stop TB) that is focussed on reaching and engaging female homeless people and migrants with quality TB services, with support of Stop TB Partnership. About 25-30% of people tested for TB (as part of LEAD's first phase) could get an upfront molecular test in public services so far. 100% of those who get a TB test should get upfront molecular test. This is necessary if we are to stop missing TB cases. As early and accurate TB diagnosis is the gateway to TB care pathway (and breaking the chain of infection transmission), all of us must ensure that: * All TB services are people-centred, human rights-based and gender transformative * We screen everyone in high burden settings (regardless of TB symptoms) with WHO recommended TB screening tools * All those who are screened as presumptive TB cases should get upfront molecular test, and be linked to effective treatment, care and support - preferably on the same day * TB programmes must integrate other healthcare and social support services too as needed and appropriate (for example, nutrition, shelter, quitting tobacco and alcohol, HIV and hepatitis test and treatment, NCDs, among others) * We must reach out to those who are likely to be on the blindspot of routine public services in a sustained manner, with models such as those developed by Humana. Initiatives led by Lisbeth and Samantha and their team are sterling examples that change is possible despite obstacles. Would governments scale these initiatives up at mass level?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum3sOUTITgv_b	2024-12-01T16:18:28-08:00	
Armageddon Is Not Just A War, It Is Also A Global Warming – OpEd	The word Armageddon does not appear in the Hebrew Bible, and appears only once in the Greek New Testament, in Revelation 16:16 which makes no mention of armies being predicted to one day gather on or near Mount Megiddo; but instead seems to predict only that 'they (will gather) the kings together to ... Armageddon'. The text does however seem to imply, based on the text from the earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the 'place called Armageddon' is 'for the war of the great day of God Almighty' which is the ongoing battle against Global Warming. Both Judaism and Islam teach their followers to take care of the earth. Muslims and Jews also believe that humans should act as guardians and trustees (stewardship and khalifah) off our planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. So what will a half degree Celsius of warming do to our planet? Europe is the world's fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. Parts of Earth's ice sheets that could lift global ocean levels by several meters will crumble with another half degree Celsius of warming, according to new research. New research suggests that the number of people threatened by sea level rise has been underestimated by tens of millions due to poorly-interpreted satellite data and a lack of scientific resources in developing countries. More than 90% of the world's population is projected to face increased risks from the compound impacts of extreme heat and drought, potentially widening social inequalities as well as undermining the natural world's ability to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere—according to a study from Oxford's School of Geography. And communities around the world emitted more carbon dioxide in 2022 than in any other year on records dating to 1900, a result of air travel rebounding from the pandemic and more cities turning to coal as a low-cost source of power. Warming is projected to intensify these hazards ten-fold globally under the highest emission pathway, says the report, published in Nature Sustainability. In the wake of record temperatures in 2022, from London to Shanghai, continuing rising temperatures are projected around the world. And Antarctic sea ice shrunk to a record low at the end of February 2023 in the 45 years of satellite record-keeping. That exceeded the previous record low set in 2022 An international team of researchers has found that approximately 90% of all marine life on Earth will be at risk of extinction by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed. High-severity wildfire is increasing in Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascade forests and has been burning at unprecedented rates compared to the years before Euro-American settlement, says a study from the Safford Lab at the University of California, Davis. High-severity burns are those where more than 95% of aboveground tree biomass is killed by fire. If humans will not reduce man made carbon magnification, not even the coming of Mahdi and Messiah may be able to overcome human unwillingness to reverse human pollution. God demands that humans fulfill their God given responsibilities. The incidence of adult diabetes in the United States has doubled over the last 20 years, afflicting 37.3 million people, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The total economic losses caused by natural disasters hit an estimated $72 billion in the first half of 2022, fueled by storms and floods, Swiss reinsurance giant Swiss Re estimated. And according to a 2020 Oxfam report, the richest 10% of the global population produce half of the Earth's fossil-fuel emissions, while the poorest half contribute a mere 10%. And for the first time in two decades, there are now more closed autocracies than liberal democracies in the world according to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-Dem Institute) at the University of Gothenburg. The democratic decline has taken place globally, and an increasing number of people are living in closed autocracies. The level of democracy enjoyed by the average world citizen in 2022 is back to 1986 levels. This means that 72 percent of the world's population, 5.7 billion people, now live under authoritarian rule. Liberal democracies do not automatically overcome autocracies. Democracies must be supported and defended. Like Judaism and Christianity, Islam has a powerful eschatological strand. Islam anticipates the end to the world as we know it, a final historical confrontation between the forces of good and evil; after which human life will be transformed in a positive way. Many Islamic traditions (Ahadith) say that Prophet Jesus, will return and will join forces with the Islamic messiah, the Mahdi, in a battle against a false messiah, the cruel one eyed Dajjal, called Armilos in Jewish tradition. Now would be a good time for one or more Messianic figures to get to work. As a Reform Rabbi who believes that the world wide upheavals we see are part of the birth pains of the Messianic Age, I offer Christians and Muslims some positive insights from the Jewish Prophets and the Rabbinic Sages. Many millions of Jews, Christians and Muslims believe the wars of Gog and Magog (Gog u-Magog in Hebrew and 'Yajuj and Majuj' in Arabic) which started in the 18th to 20th centuries will come to an end in the 21st century. It is true that human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last 250 years than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations are exploding in Africa and populations are declining in Europe. Technology produces both worldwide prosperity and worldwide pollution at the same time. Should we look upon the future with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation? Is the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday? Or are both occurring almost concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Jews, whose Biblical prophets were the ones who first wrote about a future Messianic Age, recognize that the birth of a Messianic Age must be preceded by its birth-pangs. But the prophets of Israel also emphasize the glories of a future world living in peace and prosperity with justice for all. Ancient Jewish prophecies did proclaim that there would be an end to the world as we know it. But they did not prophesy that the world will come to an end, nor did the Prophets of Israel offer an exact date for the transition. The exact advent of the Messianic Age is not knowable because humans have free will and thus the exact time and manner of redemption cannot be determined in advance. Much depends on what we humans do. The beginning of the Messianic Age is a time of transition from one World Age into another. How we move through this transition, either with resistance or acceptance, will determine whether the transformation will happen through cataclysmic changes or by a gradual reform of human society; which will lead to a world filled with peace, prosperity and spiritual tranquility. The Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the Jewish community. This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves have helped bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come about through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps and most obvious of all climate change which will affect both nature and the economy-society. The Messiah (Mahdi) refers to one or more human agents of God who help bring about a non-destruction positive transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (together with several forerunners and many disciples) will be a human being, a descendant of Prophets Abraham and David, with great qualities of national leadership similar to Prophet Moses and Prophet Mohammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Islamic 1400s we are now living in, is the age of the coming of Hazrat Mahdi. Prophet Jesus will also return to Earth in this century. As Prophet Micah states: 'In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; and exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. 'The Torah will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken. All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we (Jews, Christians and Muslims) will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.' (Prophet Micah 4:1-5) One of the signs of the End of Days is the arrival and defeat of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj or Ajuj and Majuj). Gog and Magog appear in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Quran as individuals, tribes, countries and catastrophic acts of nature. The Quran mentions Gog and Magog twice: 'He said: 'This (barrier) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the warning of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to dust (and Gog and Magog—the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists would be released into the world); and the promise of my Lord is true.' (18:98) So Gog and Magog are destructive groups like the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists, who near the time of the end of days will penetrate into every part of the world. Many of the disasters of Yajuj and Majuj have been occurring over the last few centuries. Their appearance is one of the signs of the end times. Gog and Magog are sometimes personified as individuals, sometimes identified as nations, or as terrible nature catastrophes. All references in the Bible, Qur'an and Hadith clearly indicate that human caused Gog and Magog are very numerous in number, and nature caused catastrophes will come from the northern hemisphere, at the end of times, before the Days of Judgement: The very worst period of human caused spread of Gog and Magog was the 30 years between the autumn of 1914 and the summer of 1945, when 150 million people were killed in World War I and World War II. In addition, the nature caused spread of Gog and Magog according to Patterson and Pyle (1991) added between 24.7 and 39.3 million people worldwide who died from the Spanish flu pandemic. The classical rabbinic exegetical text Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, attributed to the late first century Jewish sage, Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, contains references that prophesied the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple not just by Jews; but also by bnei Yishmael, (the sons of Ishmael). The Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer final chapter 30, lists 15 things that the sons of Prophet Ishmael will do in the holy land at the End of Days. One is particularly interesting: 'Rabbi Ishmael said: The sons of Ishmael will do fifteen things at the end of days.... They will rebuild the breaches in the wall of the beyt hamikdash (bayt al maqdis); and build a broadcast structure near the heiykal (the central sanctuary of the Holy Temple)' This broadcast structure could be in the near future, a virtual reality broadcast station from a small physical building on some open space near the Dome of the Rock. Just as millions of Muslims can join every day with tens of thousands of Muslims pilgrims praying and circling around the cube-shaped Kaaba at Islam's most sacred site; Jews would be able to strap on a headset and enter the holy city of Jerusalem, and see and hear Jewish prayers at the Western Wall, and someday God willing, as broadcast from the virtual reality Jerusalem Temple, without ever leaving their own homes. The end generation of Yajuj and Majuj may be coming soon, so it would be best if all monotheistic religions stopped being rivals, and became allies who know and respect each other: 'O mankind, We created you from male and female, and made you peoples and tribes, that you may know (respect) one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted. (Quran 49:13) The other mention of Gog and Magog in the Quran is: 'But there is a ban on a town which We have destroyed: that they (the people of the town) shall not return (to reclaim that town as their own); until Gog and Magog are let through (the barrier), and swiftly spread out in every direction.' (21:95-96) This verse refers to Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, and only reclaimed 18 centuries later as Israel's capital, following the era of the defeat of the Nazis, the Communists, and the Colonialist Empires, who had been Gog and Magog for generations. Thus, humanity has so far passed through the most devastating era of human history. However, we have not yet reached the goal of the Messianic Age when 'They (all nations) will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken.' (Prophet Micah 4:2-4) This era will begin when Israelis and Palestinians make a long lasting two state partnership of peace; thus fulfilling the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...

Similarities In The Plight Of Tibetans And Hindus In Bangladesh –...	In the last four months after the toppling of Sheik Hasina government on August by a new regime in Bangladesh, attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh appear to have become the order of the day. Not a day passes without media reporting that some temples have been attacked or some Hindus have been beaten up. Hate campaign against Hindus in Bangladesh As it appears now, the hate campaign against Hindus in Bangladesh has been allowed to go on by a government led by Mohammed Yunus, a Nobel prize winner. Recently, the Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Prabhu was arrested on sedition charges. Later on, two more Hindu monks were arrested. Now, there has been demand that Iskcon, an organisation to promote the Hindu culture and philosophy operating in Bangladesh, should be banned immediately. The above developments clearly indicate that some Islamic extremists harbouring huge animosity against Hindus are behind this 'exterminate the Hindus in Bangladesh' campaign. Dwindling population of Hindus in Bangladesh In the year 1947, Hindus constituted around 23% of the population in Bangladesh. Now, the Hindu population has shrunk to 8%, as many Hindus have left Bangladesh with their families to go to India and other countries. Obviously, the Islamic extremists and some misguided students in Bangladesh do not seem to be satisfied with the declining Hindu population trend and want it to decline further. Plight of Hindus no different from Tibetans The ground reality in Bangladesh is that the Hindus live in fear and are frustrated and feel helpless. They really do not know as to whether they would get effective and sympathetic support from other countries and from civilized people belonging to various religions across the world. In short, the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh today is no different from the plight of Tibetans when China entered Tibet and occupied the country around seven decades ago. While Tibetans resisted the Chinese invasion in the then Tibet that had no worthwhile army, China massacred the protesting Tibetans and China is now sitting pretty ruling Tibet with an iron curtain. Many Tibetans have left Tibet as refugees to other parts of the world including India. The similarity in the plight of Tibetans and Hindus in Bangladesh is that the world conscience virtually remain silent and has not taken note of the plight of Tibetans and the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. Will India deal with Bangladesh Hindus and Tibetans in the same way? For Tibet, India is a neighbouring country and India is a neighouring country for Bangladesh also. When China occupied Tibet, India did not protest and just remained silent and later on went to the extent of recognizing Tibet as part of China. Certainly, this was a historic mistake on the part of India and history will not forgive India for its recalcitrant attitude towards the plight of Tibetans. Unlike the case of Tibetans who were attacked by another country namely China, in the case of Hindus in Bangladesh, the attack seem to be carried out by Bangladesh government itself by keeping its eyes closed to the attack and vicious campaign against Hindus in Bangladesh by Islamic extremists. However, the feeling of helplessness of Tibetans and Hindus in Bangladesh are just similar in extent and intensity. In the case of Bangladesh Hindus too, India has expressed only lip sympathy so far, just in the case it did for the suffering Tibetans earlier. Though government of India has protested to Bangladesh government and insisted that it should protect minority Hindus there, government of India appears to be unwilling or hesitant to go beyond this verbal protest. Difference in approach of Muslims and Hindus / Tibetans In contrast to the reaction of the Hindus in Bangladesh and Tibetans, one should recall the protests by the Muslims all over the world when Prophet Mohammed was criticized in some European countries earlier. This shows that Tibetans who traditionally believe in peaceful co existence and are wedded to Buddhist philosophy of non violence and Hindus in Bangladesh who too share such values like Tibetans, have become whipping boys, unlike the muslims who vigorously defended their cause. What future now? The question now is will the future of Bangladesh Hindus become as uncertain as the future of Tibetans still living in Tibet and in other parts of the world. In any case, the United Nations Organisaiton, which is supposed to be a peace keeping body, is conspicuous by silence and has reduced itself to the level of mere observer ,as far as the plight of Tibetans and Bangladesh Hindus are concerned. Ultimately, it appears that the world would always be controlled by the aggressors, extremists and violent prone groups. This is a sad scenario indeed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum4N3fZ3Joimp	2024-12-01T16:02:47-08:00	
Seabed Mining: The Final Frontier Of Geopolitical Dominance – OpE...	The seabed or the 'final frontier' for resource exploration is increasingly evolving into a strategic axis for the major nations in constant pursuit to gain economic viability and regional dominance by securing strategic minerals. Recently, China and India have made substantial headway in the deep seabed mining efforts, motivated by their interests to enhance and modify their supply chains and industrial capacity, respectively. Conversely, Article 76 of UNCLOS grants Pakistan rights to exercise sovereignty on the maritime territory expanding up to 290,000 square kilometers. This expansion appoints the nation as a critical player in regional maritime affairs, having a significant legal victory Pakistan has the leverage to unveil the untapped potential for the exploration and exploitation of seabed resources. Subsequently, an emerging avenue for economic growth and resource development awaits a productive exploration. In this regard, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the International Seabed Authority (ISA) provide the legal framework for deep seabed mining exploration. However, laws to regulate the sustainable extraction of resources are underway. Primarily, Articles 140 and 143 of UNCLOS highlight that the conduct of mining activities in high seas will bear equitable benefit for mankind as a whole keeping in view the regulation of environmental protection of marine resources. As states, especially those along the coast, attempt to define the boundaries of this 'Area' of uncertainty, the high seas serve as a battlefield for their strategic interests. One potential avenue for claiming sovereignty is thought to be underwater resources. Although the deep seafloor is considered a 'common heritage of mankind,' it has the same problems with fair sharing as other res nullius. ISA is criticized, meanwhile, for its lack of objectivity across its operations. For instance, the organization's finance strategy prevents it from ceasing to give licenses without endangering its own survival. ISA mostly depends on the revenue from the exploration licenses it issues to support itself, receiving $500,000 for each license granted and an annual fee of $47,000 per contractor. Because of the way it operates, it is more likely to function as a regulator than a protector. Additionally, it prioritizes its regulatory goal over its protective one in its operational mode. The organization has come under fire for its lack of openness and for not taking scientific advice seriously enough. China's veto of a proposal to put a prohibition on granting exploitation licenses until regulations are adopted on the agenda has raised concerns that it may silence opponents of deep-sea mining within the ISA. There are two opposing viewpoints: on the one hand, nations like China and Nauru favor expediting the approval process (fast track); on the other hand, nations like Canada and Peru favor a moratorium of 10 to 15 years; Brazil and Ireland support a 'precautionary pause'; and France calls for a ban. Within established alliances, whether they are strategic (OPEC, MSP, etc.), geographical (CELAC, African Union, AOSIS), or economic (G7, BRICS+, EU), deepwater mining creates a new rift. States are forced to create new and more ad hoc alliances to defend their interests as a result of the complexity of international affairs. States use four different narratives that conflict in the media to support or oppose seabed mining. By lowering environmental pressures on land, the first two highlight the potential advantages of mining: a) access to metals required for the ecological transition; and b) revenues made in the Zone that would be shared with poor nations, serving as a mechanism for redistributive justice. However, the next two stories highlight c) our ignorance of the seafloor and the ecosystem services it offers to the earth, and d) the necessity of a stringent conservation strategy that prioritizes metal recycling over a new extraction front. Three division lines within allied blocs—between small island states, Western nations, and what is referred to as the Global South—can be seen as these arguments collide, illuminating these new tensions. Deep seabed mining signifies a $20 trillion prospect to extract critical minerals to drive green technologies. Taking note of the preceding framework, deep seabed mining activities have become more relevant lately due to the continuous depletion and dislocation of terrestrial resources such as nickel, aluminium, manganese, lithium and cobalt. Additionally, increased dependence on valuable minerals, economic interests, and strategic opportunities stimulate the sustainable exploration of yet-to-be-explored rare earth metals and minerals. This endeavor offers a potential alternative to land-based exploration opening new frontiers of mineral discovery. Therefore, the world has shifted its eyes towards deep-seabed resources. China’s seabed mining expeditions fueled by advanced technologies and institutionally centralized governance make it a leading nation in this venture. In contrast, India is demonstrating its intent to secure the 'seabed hegemony' driven by a multi-institutional approach within the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as a counterbalance to China. Regrettably, despite having established bodies like the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Maritime Affairs, and the National Institute of Oceanography, Pakistan remains notably behind in this program. Concerning this, Pakistan is over-hauled by numerous challenges encapsulating technological limitations, weak or no concerned regulatory framework, poor environmental preservation techniques, and marginal investments. This deep seabed mining industry calls for advanced technologies coupled with complex regulations to ensure sustainable practices further supported by crucial funding- areas where Pakistan currently lags. To sum up, the seafloor is becoming a new geopolitical theater with its own fault lines and justifications. The function of states is under scrutiny, as is common in contemporary geopolitics. In such a field, businesses play a crucial role - as to run million dollar venture Metal companies would advocate for the use of the seabed, which will directly profit them. Nevertheless, they can also limit the economic benefit of these new resources by opposing their usage, as evidenced by the 49 multinational corporations who have endorsed a moratorium. Additionally, some states, beginning with France, have changed their minds and are now in favor of a ban on seabed mining due to the proactive engagement of NGOs under the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition and the mobilization of the scientific community and civil society. It is unclear if this spectrum of opinions will be represented in the ISA negotiations that are scheduled for this summer.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum0uCgId_5wJd	2024-12-01T15:59:40-08:00	
Permanence And True Legacy: From Autocrats’ Greed For Wealth To T...	Nothing is permanent. The transformative and consuming power of time gradually erases or alters everything. In this transient world, even the traces individuals leave behind often fade quickly. Yet many people consider leaving behind only material wealth as sufficient. Unfortunately, this approach falls short of creating a truly lasting legacy. The insatiable drive of autocrats to accumulate wealth and property is the most striking example of this. Their attachment to material possessions prevents them from pursuing what is truly enduring. To share a personal example, after the passing of my parents, everything they had accumulated over the years was quickly dispersed. Books went to secondhand bookstores, belongings were sold to thrift shops or street vendors. The disappearance of these items, which held meaning beyond their monetary value, led me to question the permanence of what we possess. True permanence is found in written legacies. Works by thinkers like Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius, written over 2,000 years ago, still reach us today. These writings not only reflect the conditions of their times but also convey universal ideas about human existence. In doing so, they defy the passage of time and illuminate the future. Among the writings that hold special meaning for me are the letters my parents wrote to me. Reading them from time to time allows me to remember them and open a window to the past. The power of writing lies not only in what it expresses but also in its ability to create emotional connections and preserve the memories of an era. The wise words of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius' reflections on life guide not only their contemporaries but also address the challenges of our times. These works are not just books but enduring imprints on the history of humanity. Angela Merkel serves as a wonderful example in this regard, having documented her 16 years in office in a 746-page memoir. Through her narrative, we gain insight into previously undisclosed decisions and moments shrouded in darkness. For this invaluable contribution, we owe her gratitude. What is permanent is neither money nor possessions. True permanence lies in profound thoughts, philosophical teachings, and writings that withstand the test of time. While material things may vanish, ideas and writings carry forward into the future. Thus, the most powerful symbol of permanence is writing, as it transcends time and continues to guide us.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyumy2qH8mln-IZ	2024-12-01T15:56:36-08:00	
The Heartland Theory: More Relevant Than Ever? – Analysis	Sir Halford Mackinder’s famous Heartland Theory was first formulated in the early 20th century, but it holds renewed relevance and importance today, especially when analyzed though a critical lens of the current geopolitical system, one that emphasizes individual freedom, limited government intervention, and skepticism of centralized power. Mackinder’s theory posits that control over the 'Heartland' — roughly the region of Eastern Europe and Central Asia — grants substantial power over global politics and commerce due to its geographic centrality, strategic importance and resource abundance. This seemingly simple, but potent, core idea, highlights both the dangers and opportunities posed by state power struggles and emphasizes the need for decentralized and voluntary approaches to international relations and global geopolitical power balances. Mackinder argued that whoever controls the Heartland, also referred to as 'the pivot area' in his 1904 analysis 'The Geographical Pivot of History', could eventually control the world’s very trajectory. Historically, command over this central position has allowed a nation or an alliance of nations to exert immense influence over global affairs. Clearly, for liberty-loving individuals and independent thinkers, this level of dominance raises serious concerns due to the concentrated power it affords a central authority, potentially undermining individual freedoms and self-determination. It also raises very legitimate fears over the potential for coercive policies that threaten individual autonomy both domestically and internationally. What’s more, the fierce competition over the Heartland not only encourages interventionist policies, but also indirect hostile actions or even outright aggression, usually ending up in 'unholy' alliances and in devastating and costly wars. We’re seeing this all play out in real time in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As opposed to what the mainstream media propaganda and Western political leaders would have the public believe, Russia didn’t invade Ukraine out of nothing or because President Putin is some kind of comic-book madman like he is so often portrayed. Without wishing to defend any sort of aggression, especially of a military nature, and without being a Moscow apologist (for it is crystal clear that the Russian government is very far from benign and freedom-loving), there is a solid case to be made against the Western allies too, for their part in instigating this war NATO’s eastward expansion and increasing U.S. presence in Eastern Europe indicate a renewed geopolitical interest in countering Russia and China in the Heartland area and reinforcing its influence in a clearly threatening way. The West’s actions prior to and after the Ukraine invasion raise questions about interventionism’s costs and its potential for unintended consequences, as well as about the political and strategic lines that nations are willing to cross in order to expand their power and control. It goes beyond the very obvious and catastrophic impact of this war in terms of human losses (lest we forget about the more that 500,000 souls that perished after being forcibly conscripted by the Ukrainian government, many of them teenagers, civilians with little to no prior military training, or even mentally disabled individuals) and the infrastructural and economic destruction of the two warring parties. There has also been a very high price paid indirectly by the citizens of the allied nations, who never voted for or in any way consented to participating this conflict. They all just got dragged into yet another prolonged war that has already drained resources, increased national debt, and curtailed freedoms through increased surveillance, freedom of speech restrictions, military spending and direct encroachments on individual financial sovereignty. In a world that is brutally dividing itself between East and West – the Ukraine war will likely be remembered in history books as a key catalyst. Naturally, the desire to control the Heartland is not some bizarre obsession unique to the West, as Russia also fully recognizes and appreciates the power that comes with it. Moscow’s hold over Ukraine would allow the nation to secure critical land access points, obtain influence over transit routes for natural resources, and project power over Europe. Ukraine’s geographic position bridges Europe with the resource-rich lands of Central Asia, and it provides access to the Black Sea, making it a key strategic asset in Mackinder’s Heartland framework. A Russia with control over Ukraine and, by extension, control over more of the Heartland, would destabilize Europe and make the continent more dependent on Russian resources, thereby reducing Western influence and relevance on the global power balance. This is especially relevant and quite clear to see when it comes to the all-important energy market. Mackinder’s theory emphasizes the strategic value of resources in the Heartland, and indeed, today, Russia uses its energy exports as a geopolitical tool, while the West uses its sanctions as a counter-offensive weapon. With control over the substantial oil and gas reserves and key pipeline routes, Russia can exert leverage over European nations that depend on its resources, especially since so many of them have for so long adopted catastrophic energy policies (premature transition to 'green' initiatives) that have all but guaranteed this near-absolute dependence. This current dynamic demonstrably confirms Mackinder’s prediction that control over the Heartland could allow a power to dominate through resource control. Europe’s reliance on Russian gas, for instance, has exposed significant energy security vulnerabilities, particularly as Russia has intermittently restricted exports in response to sanctions and military aid from the West to Ukraine. The Heartland Theory implicitly assumes a globalist system, where powerful states vie for control and seek to influence others through centralized strategies, which clearly contradicts libertarian values, which prioritize the sovereignty and self-determination of communities and especially of the individual, the smallest minority of all. This is particularly relevant in a world where centralized, global institutions, such as the United Nations or the World Economic Forum, are forcing upon us another Cultural Revolution, and as they are increasingly involved in geopolitics, often coercing smaller nations into decisions that go against the interests of their own people, jeopardizing their security, their prosperity and regrettably, even their very existence. Of course, none of this new or even surprising to the observant students of history. Countless lives have been lost since time immemorial due to this endless and largely vain competition between nation states and alliances to gain control over the Heartland. The last time we saw a serious escalation was, of course, WWII, and we all know how that ended… Or do we? 'The virtuous Allies crushed the evil Nazis and saved the world from fascism.' That’s pretty much the summary of every history book taught in schools all over the world, of every mainstream documentary ever produced on that period and of every political speech that seeks to criticize opposing views and rivals by accusing them of being 'literally Hitler'. We see this political messaging strategy at work today, in real time, too: Victor Urban in Hungary, the AFD party in Germany, Nigel Farage in the UK, Marine LePen in France, and last but certainly not least, President Elect Trump in the US, all of them have been decided as 'literal Nazis' – though the irony of the true meaning of the term, namely 'National Socialist' is most of the time totally lost on the name-callers. What is also entirely lost on them are the circumstances that led to WWII and the rise of Hitler himself, namely the Heartland-theory-underpinned WWI (an effort to prevent a Russo-German alliance) , which ended with the callous humiliation of the Germans and the Treaty of Versailles that clearly sowed the seeds for the next World War. However, unfortunately for those of us seeking to understand history, the truth is always more nuanced than a children’s bedtime story. Or as comedian Norm MacDonald concisely put it: 'It says here in this history book that, luckily, the good guys have won every single time. What are the odds?' Take Winston Churchill for example. There has hardly ever been a more revered, nearly deified human in modern history, to the extent that one couldn’t be blamed for forgetting that he was in fact, human. We do need to remember this though, that he was just that, human, in order to provide a balanced view, one that scrutinizes actions often overlooked or sanitized in popular narratives. For instance, for all his widely celebrated strategic genius, Churchill’s leadership was also tainted by several decisions that led to catastrophic failures, resulting in unnecessary loss of life and resources, including the Gallipoli Campaign and the The Norway Campaign. Most shamefully, Churchill’s approval of area bombing campaigns is also often brushed aside in many historical accounts, even though they cost the lives of around 600,000 civilians and left around 800,000 seriously injured. The most (in)famous example of these is, of course, the firebombing of Dresden. Its barbarity, even though it was not the first of its kind nor the last, shook Churchill’s moral core – as he put it, immediately after the attack: 'Are we beasts? Are we taking this too far?…. It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed. Otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land. We shall not, for instance, be able to get housing materials out of Germany for our own needs because some temporary provision would have to be made for the Germans themselves. The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing. I am of the opinion that military objectives must henceforward be more strictly studied in our own interests rather than that of the enemy.' These raids targeted civilian populations and caused massive destruction, with questionable strategic value. One can easily argue that such actions blurred the moral distinction between the Allies and Axis powers. Of course, the consequences of twisting or 'spinning' history to match a certain narrative go far beyond the obvious, namely creating generation after generation of ill-informed, biased and naive citizens. It also shapes the policy direction of the future. As Ralph Raico explained in an analysis for the Mises Institute: 'In more recent decades, the Churchill legend has been adopted by an internationalist establishment for which it furnishes the perfect symbol and an inexhaustible vein of high-toned blather. Churchill has become, in Christopher Hitchens’s phrase, a 'totem' of the American establishment, not only the scions of the New Deal, but the neo-conservative apparatus as well—politicians like Newt Gingrich and Dan Quayle, corporate 'knights' and other denizens of the Reagan and Bush Cabinets, the editors and writers of the Wall Street Journal, and a legion of 'conservative' columnists led by William Safire and William Buckley. Churchill was, as Hitchens writes, 'the human bridge across which the transition was made' between a noninterventionist and a globalist America. In the next century, it is not impossible that his bulldog likeness will feature in the logo of the New World Order.' It is vital to keep this in mind today, as we are going through an extremely important, tectonic shift in the global geopolitical order. We need to look at history through a critical lens, to question every 'received wisdom' and to ask as many questions as possible, even if (or perhaps, especially if) they are uncomfortable. Mackinder’s Heartland Theory remains highly relevant as it highlights the ongoing struggle for control over the region and all that it implies for the world at large. For freedom-loving individuals, the theory serves as a stern warning against the dangers of centralization and interventionism. In today’s global climate, where large states aim to leverage geographic influence, military might and economic warfare, rational and decent individuals must resist convenient and simplistic narratives that paint humanity as entirely good or entirely evil, and must instead stand for non-aggression, non-intervention, decentralized cooperation, and free-market-led initiatives, as the only ways to promote stability and prosperity without the need for coercive control over any strategic 'Heartland.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YS8IVFqloM7X	2024-11-30T15:59:43-08:00	
South Sudan’s ‘Game Of Thrones’ Continues – Analysis	By Peter Fabricius After the fourth extension of South Sudan’s first post-independence elections, it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine how Africa’s youngest state will ever become a democracy. The polls were scheduled for December, with the transition ending in February 2025. But on 18 September, signatories to the 2018 peace agreement postponed elections until December 2026 because almost no progress had been made in undertaking the necessary preparations since the last extension. It is becoming ever clearer that the leaders of the bloated transitional government – most notably rivals President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Vice-President Riek Machar – do not see any self-interest in rushing into elections. As long as the transition remains in force, they remain in power, unelected but willing and able to plunder public resources. As Major General Charles Tai Gituai, Chairperson of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission, said in October, ‘many recurring challenges’ delayed implementation of the 2018 agreement by six years. These included ‘insufficient political will, trust deficit, lack of sufficient, dedicated and predictable funding, and capacity gaps.’ Gituai’s commission was set up to monitor the execution of the peace deal. This time around, he said, ‘There is unprecedented need to do things differently. A clear demonstration by the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) to mobilise sufficient resources to implement the agreement would be a strong indication of political will and commitment.’ It is becoming ever clearer that Kiir and Machar don’t see any self-interest in rushing into elections However, in his address to the United Nations Security Council, Nicholas Haysom lamented that despite the urgent need to hold elections, ‘Implementation of the revitalised agreement and its roadmap has, yet again, been relegated to the back burner while political interests play out at the national level.’ Haysom is a Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). Given the lack of preparation, he said the postponement was ‘inevitable but regrettable’. The troika of countries giving the transition most support – the United States, United Kingdom and Norway – expressed ‘profound disappointment’ at the postponement. They said South Sudan leaders had ‘demonstrated a lack of political will and have instead conserved power in the hands of a small elite’ while neglecting citizens’ welfare. By contrast, African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat merely noted the postponement and called for ‘concrete steps’ to realise the 2018 peace agreement. Workneh Gebeyehu, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Executive Secretary, actually welcomed the ‘consensual manner’ in which the postponement was decided. He called on South Sudanese to spare no effort to meet the new deadline. That effort has not been helped by the stalling of the Tumaini Peace Initiative. The initiative is a negotiation hosted by Kenya in Nairobi between the transition government and various small groups and factions who didn’t sign the 2018 agreement, about bringing them into the government. Serious compromises will be needed if South Sudan is to meet the new December 2026 deadline Machar quit the initiative in July, apparently suspecting that Kiir was exploiting the admission of new parties to dilute the powers allocated to Machar’s party in the 2018 peace deal. After an intervention by Kenyan President William Ruto on 6 November, there have been faltering efforts to revive the stalled initiative. Haysom called for serious compromises if South Sudan was to meet the December 2026 deadline. ‘Decisions, actions, realism and benchmarks associated with an implementation plan are needed,’ he declared. He said UNMISS had proposed six immediate actions. First, deploy the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF), continue their joint training and decide on command structures. Second, launch civic education and third, prepare for voter registration. Fourth, amend the National Security Services Bill to expand civic and political space and fifth, develop a code of conduct for political parties, civil society and the media. Last, clarity was needed on sharing responsibility for security during elections. Given their past deadly clashes, forming and deploying the Necessary Unified Forces that integrate Kiir and Machar’s combatants is vital. As Daniel Akech, Senior Analyst on South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, told ISS Today, ‘South Sudan doesn’t have one commander-in-chief. There are about [six].’ Haysom’s to-do list could kick-start a train of actions enabling elections in two years. But will Kiir, Machar, and the other transitional government leaders jump into action at last? It seems unlikely. Instead, the government parties ‘are likely to continue with the same 'game of thrones' mindset around the power-sharing arrangements rather than seeking legitimacy through the ballot box,’ writes Luka Biong Deng Kuol, Director of Juba’s Sudd Institute. The technical prerequisites for holding elections in 2026 are unlikely to be met in time In any case, he believes the technical prerequisites for holding elections are unlikely to be met in time. He notes that National Constitution Review Commission (NCRC) Chairperson Dr Riang Yer Zuor recently said it would take at least 18 months to make a new Constitution – if the NCRC had the necessary resources, which was unlikely. That would leave only six months to prepare for voting. Likewise, he believes it will be impossible to complete the necessary census before elections. Also, he says even if the NCRC and National Election Commission were given the resources to do the job, they were too politicised and partisan to do it properly. Akech shares his misgivings. He also notes that the eruption of civil war in neighbouring Sudan aggravates the problem. It has cut off the pipeline carrying South Sudan’s oil to port, depriving the country of most of its revenue. If South Sudan could not manage the 2024 elections when oil and money were flowing, how would it do so now? Deng proposes a neutral caretaker government of bureaucrats to administer the 2026 elections, bypassing the squabbling politicians. But the politicians would have to agree to be bypassed. Akech thinks Kiir’s firing last month of his spy chief General Akol Koor Kuc, attempts to arrest him, and last week’s subsequent shootout in Juba, were ominous. He blames that partly on the interrupted oil exports, compromising Kiir’s ability to pay his security chiefs. So far, despite localised skirmishes, the country has not relapsed into civil war. But the peace is relative and fragile.

Asia Must Brace For Impact And Opportunities Of Trade Tensions – ...	By Takashi Onoda Since August 2024, there has been a wave of new tariffs on China-made products. The United States finalised a review of Section 301 tariffs, increasing the tariffs on a range of Chinese-made products. Canada also announced 100 per cent tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs), alongside 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium products, while the European Union voted in favour of 45 per cent tariffs on EVs from China. Trade tensions may further escalate between the United States and China. US President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a 60 per cent tariff on Chinese imports alongside a universal tariff of 10–20 per cent. US consumers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, facing higher prices on imported goods. Potential Chinese retaliation could further aggravate the economic strain. Increased tariffs on Chinese imports will likely have negative global spillover effects, reducing real expenditures by US and Chinese households and dampening demand for foreign-made final goods. Damage to Chinese industries will propagate through global supply chains, decreasing demand for intermediate goods produced in third countries. This spillover effect is expected to be more pronounced in countries with strong economic ties to China. The impacts of an extreme trade war between the United States and its allies — such as the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea and Australia — and China have been studied with quantitative general equilibrium international trade models. In the study, I assumed a 30 per cent increase in trade barriers between the two groups with no change in trade barriers against third countries. The findings revealed that South Korea and Taiwan’s electrical and optical equipment sectors would shrink significantly due to their deep input–output linkages with Chinese industries, leading to a real income decline comparable to that in China. Countries closer to US and European markets with weaker input–output relations with China — such as Brazil and Turkey — could experience net positive effects by capturing market share from China, depending on model parameters. Though this scenario was more extreme in terms of the breadth of the US group and product coverage than the current conflict, it suggested that Asia is likely to experience more severe negative spillover effects. While the negative consequences are clear, rising tariffs on Chinese goods also present opportunities for other Asian countries. These countries’ products may face higher tariffs due to Trump’s proposed universal tariff increase. But their relative competitiveness compared to Chinese products improves, potentially enabling them to replace Chinese exports to the United States. Asia has already felt the impact of US–China trade tensions, reflecting this force. In 2012, the United States announced anti-dumping duties against washing machines imported from Mexico and South Korea. In response, major Korean appliance brands, Samsung and LG, shifted their export bases from Korea to China. In 2016, when the United States announced another anti-dumping duty — this time on China — these firms shifted their export bases againto Thailand and Vietnam. These shifts took place within their existing production networks, but they nonetheless boosted production and exports to the US market from each country. Beyond the reallocation of production within existing networks or specific products, manufacturing supply chains in Asia are being re-optimised, as indicated by a surge of foreign direct investment in Malaysia. Manufacturing investment in Malaysia has increased significantly. The three-year average of approved capital investment from 2021 to 2024 more than doubled compared to between 2015 and 2017. The surge is unlikely to end soon. A Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) survey conducted in 2023 with Japan-based firms revealed that approximately 10 per cent of firms with establishments in China felt that the US import restriction on Chinese products had affected their business and were concerned about trade developments. Nearly 60 per cent of firms expressed concern about the restriction, suggesting a large pool of firms could be prompted to relocate their facilities outside China if the trade war escalates further. Southeast Asia has the potential to become a focal point in this re-optimisation, with this preference also being reflected by Japanese investors. In the same 2023 JBIC survey, Vietnam surpassed China for the first time, becoming the second-most promising country for Japanese firms’ overseas business. Among firms selecting Vietnam, 22.2 per cent attributed their choice to ‘risk diversification’ and some firms identified Vietnam as a potential relocation destination from China. 20.6 per cent of voters for the Philippines — ranked eighth-most promising country for Japanese overseas business — highlighted the same factor. The escalation of the US–China trade war may further elevate risk diversification as a priority, enhancing these countries’ attractiveness. Not all Southeast Asian countries stand to benefit equally from these shifts. According to the JBIC survey, firms consistently rank ‘stable political and legal practices’ among the top factors — alongside product quality, supplier capacity and existing relationships — when selecting suppliers. Countries with political instability and weak institutions may miss the opportunity to acquire buyers seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers. Such business-friendly conditions are also critical in investment decisions. Strengthening these conditions will not only benefit the countries’ economies but also support the efficient functioning of global supply chains.

Chinese Companies Not Showing Sufficient Presence In FII – Analys...	By Zhou Chao On October 29, the 8th Future Investment Initiative (FII) officially opened in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. This event is considered one of the kingdom's most important economic activities and is often touted as the 'Davos in the Desert'. The conference brought together prominent figures from global business, finance, and technology sectors, and during the FII meetings, transactions worth billions of dollars were announced. Initially, Saudi Arabia designed the FII to support and align with the implementation of the 'Vision 2030', aiming to promote the diversification and transformation of the national economy. The goal was to establish FII as a gateway for the outside world to enter Saudi Arabia, attracting intellectual and production support to offer advice and guidance for the kingdom's development. However, as the FII has evolved, this institutional event has shifted from focusing solely on Saudi Arabia to addressing global issues, seeking solutions to tackle worldwide challenges. The theme of the 2018 FII was 'A Blueprint for the 22nd Century', under which three parallel sub-themes were established. In addition to topics related to Saudi Arabia itself, two global themes were added: 'Technology as Opportunity' and 'Advancing Human Potential'. The theme for 2019 was 'What is Next for Global Business', while in 2021, it was 'The Neo-Renaissance', followed by 'Enabling a New Global Order' in 2022, and 'New Compass' in 2023. The theme for this year is 'Infinite Horizons: Investing Today, Shaping Tomorrow'. The sub-themes under each year's main theme have gradually expanded from climate change to healthcare, finance, education, and other areas, covering various aspects of global development and governance. In addition to the themes, the organization of the FII has increasingly incorporated elements from Davos. In 2020, the hosting rights of FII became independent, managed by the newly established FII Institute, a global nonprofit foundation. The FII Institute has been advancing its 'go global' strategy, holding priority summits in locations such as Hong Kong, Miami, and Rio de Janeiro. The composition of the board of directors of the FII Institute further reflects its global trend. In addition to the chairman, Yasir al-Rumayyan, other members include the CEO of the FII Institute, Richard Attias from Morocco, former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Saudi Ambassador to the United States Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, and Mohammed al-Abbar, founder and chairman of EMMAR Properties in the UAE. However, industry professionals have noted that as the FII increasingly adopts the characteristics of Davos, the presence of China at FII has gradually diminished. Industry professionals have pointed out that in the early years of FII, Chinese companies had high levels of participation and enthusiasm, to the point where some even made a living off attending FII. However, this year, the participation of Chinese companies at the FII conference has noticeably declined. After consulting industry experts with years of experience attending the event, three main reasons were identified. Firstly, there is the rising costs of attending the conference. In addition to adopting a Davos-like format in terms of its agenda and organizational structure, FII introduced a membership model in 2023. This model selectively invites elite thinkers, investors, and business leaders handpicked by the FII Institute, with the aim of enhancing the quality of both the participants and the event itself, thus strengthening the international influence of FII. Members not only gain access to the annual flagship FII conference in Riyadh each October, but also to four international summits held throughout the year, exclusive research reports from the FII Institute, and unique investment opportunities available on the FII platform. However, becoming an FII member requires an annual fee, with basic attendance costs for both companies and individuals set at USD 15,000. It is worth noting that while Chinese investment in Saudi Arabia reached a new peak in 2023, the overall pace of business cooperation between Chinese companies and Saudi Arabia has been relatively slow this year. For these companies, the high cost of attending FII may make it difficult to justify spending tens of thousands of dollars to participate. Secondly, there are differences in management systems. In terms of annual fees, for top Chinese financial institutions and large construction companies, this would not be an astronomical figure. However, due to existing financial regulations, it is challenging to find a suitable expense category for allocating these funds. In contrast, Western investment banks and consulting firms are keen to explore opportunities within public investment fund (PIF) offices to grow their businesses, while the approach of Chinese companies is notably different. Experts say that these leading Chinese institutions, whether financial organizations or large construction companies, are mostly state-owned entities, and the approval process for overseas business trips follows public management procedures. Specifically, at least one month or 45 days in advance, approval is required before departure. If there are any changes in the itinerary, a letter of clarification may need to be written, and the approval process might even need to be restarted. Even if the trip proceeds as planned, for example, in the Gulf Arab countries, according to current regulations, the maximum duration of a visit to one country is 5 days (including international travel time), and to two countries is 7 days. Under such a management system, it would be difficult for Chinese companies to replicate the operational models of Western institutions. Furthermore, there is a deep divergence in cooperation philosophies. Saudi Arabia's international economic and trade cooperation philosophy is largely a continuation and development of the ideas from Western countries like the U.S. and Europe. This can be seen from the development of the FII, which has been deeply influenced by Davos. This reflects the widening, rather than narrowing, gap in the cooperation philosophies between China and Saudi Arabia, as well as other Gulf Arab countries. FII does not directly generate cooperative projects, hence when approval is sought for Chinese companies' participation, the approval departments often question its tangible outcomes. Similarly, when hosting forums and exhibitions in China, there is always a requirement to arrange project matchmaking and outline the results achieved. This results-oriented approach has its clear limitations. Looking back at the evolution of FII's topic selection, it is clear that FII, as a high-end showcase promoted by Saudi Arabia, is not focused on specific projects but rather aims to lead trends or create concepts and standards. Whether it is trends, waves, or ideas and standards, they are not converted into concrete projects at the present moment, but instead lay the conceptual foundation for future projects or categories of projects to emerge. The biggest difference between Chinese companies and Western firms in exploring the Gulf market is that Chinese companies tend to focus on 'projects', while Western companies focus on 'markets', leaving the former to lag behind even at the earlier conceptual design stage. The information from FII shows that during this conference, Saudi Arabia's renowned energy developer ACWA Power announced on October 29, 2024, that it would invest USD 54 million to jointly establish a new energy technology research and development center in Lujiazui, Shanghai, in partnership with the Lujiazui Administration. Additionally, it will invest USD 800 million to co-develop Morocco's wind power market with Gotion High-Tech. Private enterprises have demonstrated significant advantages in their efforts to attract Saudi capital, showing great flexibility and strength, and their vitality and practical impact should not be underestimated. Final analysis conclusion: In the past two years, cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia, as well as other Middle Eastern countries and capital, has been continuously strengthened. Recently, Saudi Arabia announced its agreement to establish a Saudi-China Special Economic Zone, which is seen as a sign of deepening cooperation. However, at Saudi Arabia's most prestigious economic forum, the presence of Chinese enterprises has been shrinking, which is not a positive sign for China's future influence and interests in the broader Middle East-Gulf region. Meanwhile, private enterprises have shown clear vitality in expanding cooperation with Gulf capital, and this is something that should be recognized.

Indonesia: Case Against Ex-Minister Seen As Gauge Of Democratic P...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus For many Indonesian democracy activists, a former trade minister’s upcoming corruption trial will test whether Prabowo Subianto, the new president, upholds the rule of law or uses legal mechanisms to suppress political criticism. They are concerned that the 53-year-old ex-minister, Thomas Lembong, a Prabowo opponent, was arrested and charged for political reasons. The Oct. 29 arrest came just nine days after Prabowo was sworn in as president. Who is Thomas Lembong: The former trade minister, popularly known as Tom Lembong, had backed an opponent of Prabowo in the 2024 presidential election. He was also an outspoken critic of policies of Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Prabowo’s immediate predecessor who had backed his presidential run. Lembong, who became known for reportedly writing some of Jokowi’s celebrated speeches, including the memorable 2018 'Winter is Coming' address that evoked the 'Game of Thrones' TV series, will stand trial for corruption in a controversial sugar import case. On Tuesday, a Jakarta district court rejected Lembong’s pre-trial motion challenging his arrest, and ruled there was sufficient evidence to bring him to trial nearly 10 years after his alleged offense. Why the issue matters: Indonesia transitioned to democracy in 1998 after more than three decades of authoritarian rule. Jokowi, who served two terms as president until Oct. 20, was criticized for curbing opposition voices. Some fear that stifling criticism of the government could worsen under Prabowo, a former general accused of human rights abuses during his time in the military. Democracy watchers see the case against Lembong as a potential bellwether for Indonesia’s democratic trajectory under the new administration. A Harvard graduate, businessman and former investment banker, Lembong served as trade minister under Jokowi in 2015-2016, and was his close ally until 2019. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in his 2020 autobiography, in fact credited Lembong as helping him build a close bond with Jokowi, The Sydney Morning Herald reported last month. Lembong later turned into a fierce critic of Jokowi’s policies and towards the end of 2023 joined then-presidential candidate Anies Baswedan’s campaign team as 'co-captain.' Analysts believe Lembong’s outspokenness and his close association with Anies make him a target. The charges: The attorney general’s office has accused Lembong of authorizing the import of 105,000 metric tons of raw sugar through a private company while he was trade minister (2015–2016), despite a domestic surplus of the commodity. This decision allegedly caused state losses totalling 400 billion rupiah (U.S. $25.19 million). The attorney general’s office further claims that Lembong’s actions violated regulations stipulating that only state-owned enterprises could import the commodity. Lembong said during a pretrial hearing that he had consistently consulted with then-President Jokowi on import policies, including those for sugar. The ex-trade minister’s lawyer, Ari Yusuf Amir, said the prosecution’s case lacked the foundation to move forward, and specifically questioned the source of the 400 billion rupiah number. What the pundits say: Political analysts note that Lembong’s arrest comes amid strong buzz about Anies launching an organization that will morph into a political party ahead of the next general election, with a key role for the ex-trade minister. Anies is seen as the most viable presidential hopeful in the 2029 polls and Lembong, his right-hand man, is perceived as indispensable to him. Ambang Priyonggo, of Multimedia Nusantara University, said the arrest suggests an attempt at weakening Anies’ candidacy by leaving him without his prime asset. 'I believe the political undertones behind Tom Lembong’s arrest cannot be dismissed,' Ambang said. He added that other ministers who adopted similar policies as Lembong is being faulted for have not been investigated. 'This certainly gives the appearance of a witch hunt,' Ambang told BenarNews. He warned that selective enforcement of the law could fuel perceptions of Prabowo’s authoritarian tendencies. A political analyst at the National Research and Innovation Agency, Poltak Partogi Nainggolan, concurred. Limiting the investigation to Lembong risked damaging the credibility of Prabowo’s administration, he said. '[A]ny facts that emerge must be acted upon, including the potential investigation of the other five trade ministers [after Lembong] who were allegedly aware of the questionable practices now labeled as corruption,' he told BenarNews. 'The continuation of [Jokowi’s] repressive political and legal practices will only hinder the creation of an environment conducive to economic progress,' Partogi said. What the government says: Attorney General Sanitiar Burhanuddin dismissed claims that the case was politically motivated. 'There is absolutely no political agenda in the case of Tom Lembong,' he said during a parliamentary hearing on Nov. 13. 'It is purely a legal matter, and that is the basis on which we are proceeding.' What’s next: Lembong was ready to seek justice, he said in a handwritten statement published by the Indonesian media on Wednesday. 'I remain committed to uncovering the truth and upholding justice. I love Indonesia, and my determination to dedicate my life to this country is stronger than ever,' his statement said. He just may seek inspiration from the Avengers, comic book superheroes referenced in another speech he penned for Jokowi, which the ex-president delivered in 2018 at a forum in Hanoi.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWTUo6Khsq2P	2024-11-30T15:52:37-08:00	
Atlanticists Mobilize To Salvage NATO As Russia Toughens Its Stan...	The American film maker and philanthropist who created the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, George Lucas, once said, 'Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.' Within a week of Russia 'testing' the Oreshnik hypersonic missile in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, against which the NATO has no defence, the Western alliance is already transiting through the Dark Side from fear to hatred and hurtling toward unspeakable suffering. The Russian Defence Ministry has disclosed that since the Oreshnik’s appearance in the war zone, Ukraine carried out two more attacks on Russian territory with ATACMS missiles. In the first attack on November 23, five ATACMS missiles were fired at an S-400 anti-aircraft missile division near the village of Lotarevka in Kursk Region. The Pantsir missile defense system, which provided cover for this division, destroyed three of them while two missiles reached the target damaging the radar. There are casualties among the personnel. In the second attack by 8 ATACMS missiles at the Kursk-Vostochny airfield on Monday, seven were shot down while one missile reached the target. The falling debris slightly damaged the infrastructure facilities and two servicemen suffered minor injuries. The Russian MOD stated that 'retaliatory actions are being prepared.' The Russian military experts estimate that the attacks were planned for sometime and the Americans handled the targeting. On November 25, White House acknowledged for the first time the shift in policy allowing the use of ATACMS to attack Russian territory. Admiral John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, revealed during a press gaggle on Monday, inter alia, saying that 'well, obviously we did change the guidance and gave them [Kiev] guidance that they could use them, you know, to strike these particular types of targets.' Following the attack on Monday, Ukraine sought an emergency meeting of the NATO–Ukraine Council in Brussels at the level of permanent representatives. Oreshnik was the main topic, and the need to strengthen air defence system. The NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said later, 'Our support for Ukraine helps it fight, but we need to go further to change the trajectory of this conflict.' No doubt, NATO is very concerned about the emergent situation but still won’t accept a Russian victory. Hotheads in the West are once again talking about the deployment of troops by NATO countries to Ukraine for combat operations, which was originally mooted by French President Emmanuel Macron in February. But plainly put, unless the US is willing to put boots on the ground, the rest of NATO simply run around like a headless chicken. The UK with a 80000-strong army has very few combat units; the 175,000-strong German army has forgotten how to fight; and France is in deep political and economic crisis. As for the US, the public opinion opposes wars and president-elect Donald Trump cannot ignore it. However, petrified that Trump may turn his back on the war, there is a school of thought in Europe that they could offer something interesting to incentivise him other than the carrot of Ukraine’s vast stores of critical minerals that Americans lack — eg., more trading incentives for America; greater spending on NATO; more pressure on Iran; 'peacekeeping boots on the ground' inside Ukraine; help in Trump’s upcoming economic skirmishes with China and so on. Meanwhile, much brainstorming is going on in the US too as to how to save NATO from Trump’s scalpel. A Guardian columnist wrote, 'If the EU and UK seize the $300bn of Russian state assets sitting in Euroclear, money Putin has long written off, we can bring serious funding to the table. Trump does not need to spend any more money on Ukraine – we can buy the weapons. America can even make a profit while securing peace in Europe. Trump would be able to show how he got those parasitic Europeans to cough up, prove his detractors wrong by rebooting America’s most traditional alliances – all while putting 'America first'.' All this testifies to the angst in the European mind that Oreshnik has forced a paradigm shift in the Ukraine war. The triumphalist betting that Russia would be bluffing on nuclear deterrence has given way to fear, since Russia now may not need nuclear weapons to retaliate against attacks on its territory. Oreshnik is a non-nuclear weapon, it is by no means a weapon of mass destruction but is a high-precision weapon of immense destructive power that annihilates its targets — and Europeans have no means to defend against it. Succinctly put, if Biden’s plan to 'Trump-proof' the Ukraine war has put Europe and Ukraine in a royal fix making them a punch bag for Russia. Make no mistake, Oreshnik will soon make sure that there won’t even be a proxy regime in Ukraine for the West to 'support'. It is humiliating to watch the proxy’s nose being rubbed in the dust. A punishing Russian retaliation is imminent for the two latest ATACMS attacks. The sharp deterioration in Russia’s ties with the UK suggests a high probability that Britain could be in Moscow’s crosshairs. The station chief of the British intelligence in the embassy in Moscow has been expelled; western reports cite significant supplies of Storm Shadow missiles (numbering 150) to Ukraine lately after the election of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The top Russian military expert Alexei Leonkov told Izvestia newspaper, 'Here is the fact of the US targeting, here are the fragments of the ATACMS missile, by which it can be clearly identified. We have the right to strike back. Where and how will be decided by the Ministry of Defence and the Supreme Commander—in-Chief. He [Putin] said that they would be warned about the impact. Our enemies must prepare for an answer. The big question is at what point Russia may strike the NATO military hubs in Romania and Poland. The former Russian President and Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday that all bets are off. 'If the conflict develops by the escalation scenario, it is impossible to rule out anything, because the NATO member states have effectively got fully involved in this conflict,' he said in an interview with Al Arabiya. Medvedev added in chilling words, 'The Western states must realise that they fight on Ukraine’s side… Meanwhile, they fight not only by shipping weapons and providing money. They fight directly, because they provide targets on Russian territory and control American and European missiles. They fight with the Russian Federation. And if this is the case, nothing could be ruled out… even the most difficult and sad scenario is possible. 'We would not want such scenario, we have all said that repeatedly. We want peace, but this peace must take Russia’s interest into consideration in full.' Indeed, the only logical explanation for Biden’s brinkmanship in collusion with the Atlanticists in Europe in the lame duck phase of his presidency is that Oreshnik has upstaged his best-laid plans. Saner voices in Europe are speaking up. In a hugely symbolic act of defiance, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico disclosed on Wednesday that he has accepted an official invitation from Putin to the events in Moscow in May commemorating the 80th anniversary of Victory in World War II. Slovakia is a member country of both EU and NATO. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer in a telephone conversation with Trump, reaffirmed Austria’s readiness to serve as a platform for international peace talks on Ukraine. During the conversation, Trump reportedly evinced interest in Nehammer’s previous exchanges with Putin on Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YQpyW97guT9A	2024-11-30T15:50:59-08:00	
An Austrian Perspective On Tariffs – OpEd	Tariffs have been a key instrument in government trade policies for centuries. For instance, one of the wealthiest ancient countries, Khazaria (7th-10th centuries CE), did not tax its citizens directly but instead imposed tariffs on all passing caravans due to its strategic location along major trade routes. In the United States, before introducing the federal income tax (1913), the government generated revenue primarily through tariffs. The role of tariffs is widely debated today, especially during election periods. What Are Tariffs? A tariff is, in essence, a tax imposed by a government on goods and services imported from other countries. The main purpose of tariffs is to make imported goods more expensive, thereby protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, to raise government revenue, and/or to influence trade policies. Tariffs can be broken down into two main types:Specific tariffs: a fixed fee imposed per unit of imported goods (e.g., $100 per ton of imported steel) Ad valorem tariffs: a percentage of the value of the imported goods (e.g., 10 percent on imported electronics). Historically, tariffs were one of the primary sources of revenue for governments. Today, although their revenue-generating role has diminished, they are still used to protect domestic industries, control trade balances, and as leverage in international negotiations. How Tariffs Work When a company imports goods subject to tariffs, it must pay the tariff at the border, typically to customs authorities, before the goods are cleared. This means companies often pay the tariff upfront before selling the goods in the domestic market. When a tariff is imposed, it raises the cost of imported goods at the point of entry, which has several effects on the economy: Raising Prices for Consumers The most direct effect of tariffs is that they often make imported goods more expensive. Importers—facing higher costs because of tariffs—typically attempt to pass these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. For instance, if a 10 percent tariff is placed on imported cars, the price of those cars may rise by a similar amount. However, this increase is not always guaranteed, as market dynamics often prevent the transfer of the additional costs to consumers. Protecting Domestic Producers By making foreign goods and factors more expensive, tariffs create a protective barrier for domestic industries. Domestic producers can try to increase their prices, as the cost of imported alternatives rises. For instance, if tariffs are imposed on imported steel, domestic steel manufacturers benefit because the higher price of imported steel makes their products more attractive, even if they are more expensive than they would be in a fully open market. Retaliatory Tariffs and Trade Wars Tariffs can also spark retaliatory measures from trading partners, leading to trade wars. When one country imposes tariffs, affected nations may respond by placing tariffs on goods exported by the initial country, which escalates the situation. Trade wars can disrupt international supply chains, raise costs for businesses and consumers, and reduce economic growth. Market Dynamics and Tariffs: Passing on Costs Often, however, the costs of tariffs cannot be truly passed on to consumers. The extent to which the burden of tariffs is transferred depends on market dynamics, such as competition and consumer demand. In highly-competitive industries, companies may absorb the costs of tariffs to maintain their market share, sacrificing profit margins rather than risking losing customers to competitors. This pushes up production costs, hampers market dynamics, and may even push firms out of business. The Austrian Approach to Tariffs and Comparative Advantage The Austrian School of economics advocates for minimal government intervention in markets, promotes free trade, and supports individual liberty. Austrian economists view tariffs as detrimental to the natural efficiency of the market, because they distort price signals and lead to the misallocation of resources. Murray Rothbard explained that 'Tariffs injure the consumer with the ‘protected’ area, who are prevented from purchasing from more efficient competitors at a lower price.' The Austrian critique of tariffs is heavily rooted in the concept of comparative advantage, which argues that countries should specialize in producing goods where they are relatively more efficient. Even if a country is more efficient at producing all goods than another country, both can still benefit from trade if each specializes in goods for which it has a comparative advantage. This principle—originally developed by David Ricardo—emphasizes that trade allows for a more efficient allocation of global resources, lowering production costs and increasing prosperity for all participants. In the context of comparative advantage, consider two countries—Country A and Country B—both of which produce electronics and textiles. Suppose Country A requires 8 hours to produce 1 unit of electronics and 4 hours for 1 unit of textiles. Country B, however, requires 10 hours to produce 1 unit of electronics and 8 hours for 1 unit of textiles. Even though Country A is more efficient in producing both electronics and textiles, the principle of comparative advantage suggests that each country should specialize based on where they have a relative advantage. For Country A, the opportunity cost of producing 1 unit of electronics is 2 units of textiles (8/4). For Country B, the opportunity cost of producing 1 unit of electronics is 1.25 units of textiles (10/8). Thus, even though Country A is absolutely better at producing both goods, it is relatively better at producing textiles, while Country B is relatively better at producing electronics. If both countries specialize accordingly—Country A in textiles and Country B in electronics—and then trade, they can both enjoy more of each good than if they tried to produce both themselves. However, if Country A imposes a 20 percent tariff on imported electronics from Country B, the cost of those imported electronics increases, making them less competitive in Country A’s market. This could cause Country A to shift resources inefficiently back into electronics production, even though it is less cost-effective than focusing on textiles. This illustrates how tariffs can disrupt the natural efficiency of trade and specialization, leading to suboptimal outcomes for both countries. In general, from an Austrian perspective, tariffs distort price signals, which are essential for the efficient allocation of resources in a market economy. Prices in a free market reflect the underlying scarcity of goods, consumer preferences, and production costs. Tariffs, by artificially inflating the price of imported goods, disrupt these signals and lead consumers and producers to make inefficient choices. Imposing tariffs for the sake of addressing a trade imbalance will not resolve the underlying cause, which is typically a loss of competitiveness in the entire industry or in specific goods. Tariffs make these industries even less competitive than they were before tariff imposition. Moreover, creating a 'protective area' will force other companies to flock into protected industries, essentially depriving established firms of their initial monopolist benefits while leaving the overall misallocation of production and harm to consumers intact. Rothbard explained, 'In the long run, therefore, a tariff per se does not establish a lasting benefit even for the immediate beneficiaries.' Austrian Approach and National Security Concerns While Austrian economists emphasize the efficiency of free markets and the advantages of comparative advantage, the case for free trade becomes more nuanced when national security concerns arise. Unfortunately, when national security is at stake, economic priorities often yield to political and strategic imperatives. Throughout history, political instability and conflicts have led governments to emphasize self-sufficiency over market efficiency, particularly in industries vital to defense. During such times, the state assumes its primary role—to defend the nation—and under this pretext, interference in the economy becomes profound and widespread. There is no perfect strategy for managing a wartime economy; any approach will inevitably diverge from the Austrian preference for minimal intervention. However, it is hard to imagine that war preparation would go unnoticed, and if a nation depends completely on a particular resource from an unfriendly country, the market price of that product would skyrocket. This, in turn, would signal entrepreneurs to either stockpile large quantities of the resource at current prices, seek alternative suppliers that were previously ignored because of prohibitive costs, or seize the opportunity to revive domestic production. To lessen the challenges posed by such shifts, countries should carefully select their trading partners. For instance, trade with authoritarian or totalitarian regimes should be limited, and dependencies on these nations should be avoided to reduce strategic risks. Trade relations should primarily focus on allies who share similar values of open markets, respect for private property, and sound economic principles. When such alignment exists, political relationships tend to support the economic efficiency that the Austrian School advocates, fostering a more resilient and mutually beneficial trading environment. The reliance on administrative measures often stems from a belief that market forces cannot respond quickly or effectively to crises, leading to policies that distort incentives and stifle innovation. By undermining price signals, governments often create monopolies or grant undue privileges to certain industries, consolidating power in ways that harm overall economic efficiency. This skepticism of market mechanisms reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of their adaptability and the profound role they play in dynamically coordinating resources, even under the pressures of wartime.

IAEA Warns Of Impact On Nuclear Safety Of Attacks On Ukraine’s En...	International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said that Ukraine's three operating nuclear power plants have had to reduce their electricity generation as a result of attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. In the agency's latest update it said that the nuclear power plants - Khmelnitsky, Rivne and South Ukraine - had to lower their power levels on Thursday for the second time in two weeks as a precautionary safety step. The three plants have a total of nine reactors between them. One reactor at Rivne was disconnected from the grid and all three plants continued to receive off-site power, although Khmelnitsky lost connection to two of its power lines. Grossi said: 'Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is extremely fragile and vulnerable, putting nuclear safety at great risk. Once again, I call for maximum military restraint in areas with major nuclear energy facilities and other sites on which they depend.' IAEA teams visited seven substations located outside the nuclear power plants in Ukraine in September and October to assess the situation after strikes on the energy infrastructure in August. Grossi reported to the IAEA board of governors earlier this month that there had been 'extensive damage' and concluded that the reliability of off-site supply to nuclear power plants had been 'significantly reduced'. In his statement issued on Thursday, he said: 'The IAEA will continue to assess the extent of damage to facilities and power lines that are essential for nuclear safety and security. The IAEA will continue to do everything in its power to reduce the risk of a nuclear incident during this tragic war.' The IAEA has had teams stationed at each of Ukraine's nuclear power plants, and it said there had been no reports of direct damage to nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants need to have an electricity supply to ensure necessary safety functions can take place as well as reactor cooling, and they also need reliable connections to the grid to be able to distribute the electricity they produce. In addition to Ukraine's three operating nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been under Russian military control since early March 2022. Its reactors are all shut down and it has had to rely on emergency diesel generators on occasions when it has lost all access to off-site power. The IAEA has set out its seven rules for nuclear safety and security during the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which have been adopted by the United Nations Security Council. They include the core principles that no-one should fire at, or from a nuclear power plant, or use a nuclear power plant as a military base.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YQ7v6L8moPO_	2024-11-30T15:48:04-08:00	
Greater Energy Levels By GOP Produce Victories Over Democrats – O...	Over thirty years ago, Republican historian and political analyst, Kevin Phillips, remarked that the 'Republicans go for the jugular while the Democrats go for the capillaries.' This serious disparity in political energy levels is rarely taken into account to explain election turnouts. The voluntary enfeebling of the Democratic Party started long ago. In 1970, writing in Harper’s Magazine, economist John Kenneth Galbraith, a co-founder of Americans for Democratic Action, wrote an article 'Who Needs Democrats? And What It Takes to be Needed?' He argued that if the Democratic Party does not take on the corporate and political establishment, it has no purpose at all. In 2001, long after the 1980 Reagan landslide of Jimmy Carter, Labor Secretary under Clinton, Robert Reich, wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post which declared, '…The Democratic Party. It’s Dead.' In the following years, while the Democrats were accelerating their abandonment of half the country as 'red states,' and became more out of touch with blue-collar workers and unions, whom they took for granted, the Republicans were becoming more energized by the year. Their mouthpieces dominating talk radio – e.g., Rush Limbaugh – were directly sowing unrebutted discord, day after day, among blue-collar workers against the Democrats. Why? It’s because the Democrats essentially gave up on Talk Radio and didn’t bother listening to how these corporatist radio bloviators were turning hard working listeners into Reagan Democrats. While the GOP was eroding the core base of the Democratic Party and taking total control of red state legislatures, governorships, and courts, the Democrats, starting in 1979, were plunging into enticing and taking corporate PAC money, as urged by then Rep. Tony Coelho (D-CA). This reliance on corporate campaign money weakened the Party’s positions and actions on behalf of workers, consumers, the environment, and the need for an expanded social safety net for the populace. Western nations have provided their citizens superior health care, family support and education programs for decades. The comparative energy levels were exhibited in the 2010 state gerrymandering drive. While the Democrats were snoozing, a laser beam effort in several states, like Pennsylvania, took the Dems to the cleaners. The result: majority GOP Congressional delegations for a decade even though the Democrats won the popular vote there. (See: Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America’s Democracy by David Daley.) Recall, in 2009 Obama had a large majority Democratic advantage in the House and Senate as a result of his win over John McCain in November 2008. Instead of going forward full throttle with this mandate, Obama chose extreme caution. He focused on Obamacare, after giving up right at the beginning the crucial 'public option' allowing people to opt out of the corporate health insurance grip. He gave it up unilaterally before negotiations began with the obstructive GOP. For the rest of his term, Obama appeared to be resting. He promised a $9.50 federal minimum wage in his 2008 campaign but didn’t lift a finger for it during his first term. It is still at a poverty wage of $7.25 per hour to this day. He didn’t really put up a grassroots fight for his stimulus bill following the Wall Street collapse and the great recession starting under George W. Bush, (the war criminal against the Iraqi people.) Obama even declined to prosecute the Wall Street crooks. In the meantime, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, managed to lose the House to a reactionary GOP in the 2010 elections, the 2012 elections, the 2014 elections and the 2016 elections, straightjacketing any possible Obama agenda in the Congress. The Dems had the popular New Deal agenda update in their grasp, but let it slip through their fingers while the GOP had a corporatist anti-worker, consumer, and women’s agenda and with ferocious energy blocked improvements supported by a majority of people in the US. Even more inexplicable was the Democratic Party’s refusal to strongly support the galvanizing political civic movement to cancel the Electoral College (see NationalPopularVote.com). This organizing effort has led so far to the passage of state laws (California, New York, Illinois, etc.) handing the Electoral College vote to the presidential candidate who wins the national popular vote. The Democrats won the popular vote in 2000 (Al Gore) and 2016 (Hillary Clinton) but lost the Electoral College vote to G.W. Bush and the surprised Donald Trump. Still, the Democrats stay on the sidelines though this movement already has enabled state laws totaling 215 Electoral College votes, needing only to get to 270 to neutralize this anti-democratic vestige from the historic era of slavery. Almost everywhere you look you see this huge disparity in energy levels. Compare the smaller Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives with the Pelosi-toady Progressive Caucus. The difference is that between thunder and slumber over the years. Compare the Tea Party’s slamming impact on the established GOP in Congress with the tepid attitude of most labor unions and the AFL-CIO deferring to the Democratic Party. Compare the over-the-top corporate judges to the so-called liberal judges, as relating to federal cases against Trump. Compare the comprehensive ghastly Heritage Foundation’s 900-page 2025 blueprint directed toward the GOP expansion of the corporate state and the stripping away of services to the people and their rights with the agenda advanced by the progressive citizen groups. No comparison. The media notices this difference in energy levels which is one reason it gives more coverage to the right-wing messianic bulldozers who show in every way that they are hungrier for taking power as they take no prisoners. Partisan energy disparities even extend to the right-wing vs. left-wing media. The former has the brazen Fox News network. The left has nothing like that. Bill Moyers told me he urged mega-rich George Soros and allies to start a competing progressive network after Fox became quickly formidable. No way. The right-wing magazines cover the actions of their right-wing allies, plus those gatherings and books. While the progressive media mostly ignores reviewing progressive books and what citizen groups are driving for against corporate power in Washington, DC, and at the state level. The Progressive media prefers publishing their opinions and exposé pieces. That’s one reason why there are more non-fiction right-wing corporatist books which become best sellers, while progressive tomes gather dust. Further weakening the energy gap in favor of the GOP are the Democrats who look for scapegoats like the Greens to account for their disgraceful losses. They rarely look at themselves in the mirror. Democrats like Norman Solomon (See, Roots Action) issue 'autopsy reports' following Party defeats. The 2017 report documented the Democratic Party’s arrogant, entrenched leadership which ignores the progressive base. After the November 5th debacle, have you heard about mass resignations by Democrats responsible for this victory by the convicted felon, chronic liar, bigot, corrupt, phony promisor Trump? Well, the DNC chair, Jamie Harrison is resigning but that is pro forma. Other Democratic leaders are still on board at the state and federal level, in addition to, astonishingly enough, the failed corporate political/media consultants who enriched themselves while wasting away the biggest flood of campaign money in American history on the Kamala Harris campaign. Younger Democrats who raise the need to displace the failed Democratic apparatchiks, and who want popular vigorous progressive agendas, as espoused by the naturally popular Senator Bernie Sanders, get ignored or worse pushed out of contention, visibility and, importantly, respect. The Party’s losing elders have assured the absence of farm teams, of successors. Speaker Pelosi and her deputy Rep. Steny Hoyer are experts at this geriatric supremacy despite their track record of losing to the aggressive Republican plutocrats. Energy counts, matters and wins the political battles. There isn’t even any adrenaline around the Dems’ capillaries.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YSms0NF0o9qz	2024-11-30T15:45:58-08:00	
Russia Increases Ties With Iran’s Axis Of Resistance – Analysis	On November 19, Israel announced it found a large cache of Russian arms at the hand of Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. Reports show that many of the weapons were initially owned by the Syrian military, to which Russia has supplied weapons for years (Times of Israel, November 19). This indicates growing cooperation between Russia and the militias across the Middle East (see EDM, September 18). While Russia has been opportunistic in the Middle East, it does not have a blueprint for an overarching peace in the region, nor does it genuinely strive to achieve it by portraying itself as a substitute for the United States (see EDM, October 7). Russia seeks a measured increase in its geopolitical influence via bilateral deals with key Middle East actors. These are enhanced through close military, security, and economic ties and are especially valuable in the age of Russia-West rivalry following the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia turned to the Middle East and wider Asia to withstand the pressure of sanctions by seeking alternative trade routes and sources of foreign investments. One such enhanced relationship is Russia’s ties with Iran in the international consequences of the war in Ukraine (see EDM, November 4). Yet what largely fell out of focus is how this alignment allowed Moscow to deepen relations with Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' a network of militias across the Middle East that the Islamic Republic operates. From Houthis to Hezbollah to Hamas, Russia has increased its diplomacy and, in some cases, military cooperation over the past couple of years (see EDM, August 8). Russia has been actively engaged in expanding security and military ties with the Houthis, including providing weapons to the organization. Media reports indicate that Russian intelligence officers were spotted in the Houthis-held territory, and Moscow has even considered sending significant military support to the Iran-backed militia (Iran International, September 25). Moreover, political contacts became more common, with Houthi and Russian officials holding regular meetings (TASS, July 2). In Gaza, where Israel has waged a massive military campaign, Russia has considered Hamas as a legitimate ruler (see EDM, October 16, November 1, 2023). This February, Moscow hosted an intra-Palestinian conference where officials from Hamas, along with those from Fatah and Islamic Jihad, participated (Al Jazeera, August 13). Russia also abstained from criticizing Hamas for the attack on Israel and was somewhat critical of the latter throughout the past year (see EDM, October 23, 2023). Moscow knows the limits of its power in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and especially in internal Palestinian affairs. Its response, however, is about how it will be perceived internationally, presenting itself as a reliable and, most of all, largely pro-Arab power in the Middle East (see EDM, February 22, October 15). This fits into Moscow’s overall strategy of pivoting to Asia and the Middle East, especially closer ties with the Arab states. This posture concerns messaging that the United States has failed as a responsible actor in the Middle East (see EDM, October 21). Hezbollah is another critical player within Iran’s Axis of Resistance with which Russia has maintained close contact. Russia has been critical of Israel’s campaign of targeting high-ranking Hezbollah leaders. When Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr was killed in late July, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry issued concern that Israel’s attacks would complicate the regional situation (Atalayar, September 15). Moscow has also been vocal about how resilient Hezbollah has been in the face of the Israeli onslaught (MEMO, October 9). There is also a security and military aspect to the Russia-Hezbollah engagement. Both Hezbollah and Russian forces cooperated during the civil war in Syria. The two were instrumental in helping Bashar al-Assad to retain power from 2015 onwards. In addition to Israel’s claim about finding extensive caches of Russian arms supplied to Hezbollah on November 19, some media outlets have previously suggested, however unlikely, that Hezbollah sent fighters to Ukraine to aid Russia’s war effort (Israel Hayom, March 27, 2022). Moscow sees these contacts as a powerful leverage not only against the United States but also the regional countries such as Saudi Arabia and Israel. In the case of the Houthis, close cooperation allows Moscow to acquire a powerful leveraging tool against Riyadh if the latter chooses a more pro-US position. This is especially pertinent as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term is eagerly anticipated among the Arab states, which expect more transactional relations with the United States (Anadolu Ajansı, November 6; Middle East Eye, November 7). The Houthis also allow Moscow to put pressure on the collective West and distract it from the war in Ukraine. Similarly, close ties with Hamas and Hezbollah enable Russia to signal to Israel that should it shift its approach over Ukraine or attack Iran’s nuclear program, Moscow is ready to increase cooperation with the two militias (see EDM, February 22). This approach is a result of cooling in Moscow-Tel Aviv relations since the war in Ukraine began and especially so after the hostilities in Gaza. Russia is an opportunistic power in the Middle East. It benefits from the United States’ failure to bring an end to the war in Gaza and conclude the normalization process between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Moscow equally recognizes the limits to what it can do in the region, but over the past couple of years, Russia’s posture in the Middle East has increased, and a big part of it is due to the close ties with Iran’s Axis of Resistance.

Rapid Collapse Of Syrian Forces Around Aleppo Stuns Many	By Edward Yeranian The rapid collapse of Syrian government forces inside and around the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, has caught many observers by surprise and is causing a domino effect on many parts of the country. Rebel fighters, who oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad and include those from the terrorist Jabhat al Nusra group, fired weapons Saturday inside Syria's northern 'economic capital' of Aleppo after the withdrawal of government forces from the city. Amateur video showed rebel fighters in control of Aleppo's central Saadallah Jabari Square, in addition to Aleppo University and the city's provincial government headquarters. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported that Syrian government forces also withdrew from Aleppo's civilian and military airports. Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia showed amateur video of rebels apparently in control of the military airport. Britain-based Syrian analyst Rami Abdulrahman, of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told Arab media that Iranian forces and their proxy militia allies have withdrawn from many positions in and around Aleppo. Abdulrahman said that Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces withdrew from the region after a drone attacked them and their allies, including Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militia fighters, who pulled out alongside them. Arab media reported that the entire region between Aleppo and the rebel-controlled province of Idlib had fallen and that large towns south of Aleppo on the main Aleppo-Damascus highway, including Saraqib and Maarat al-Numan, also were captured. It was not clear if other large Syrian cities would fall, but Joshua Landis, who heads the Middle East studies program at the University of Oklahoma, told VOA that all eyes are now on Hama, which is Syria's fourth-largest city. Landis said he believes it is possible the capital of Damascus may fall, because government supporters are dispirited and have lost the will to fight. Despite Turkish government denials, Landis says the entire operation has 'Turkish fingerprints written all over it,' since 'all the arms and food and money that enter Idlib come from Turkey.' 'I'm sure Turkey wanted to give Assad a slap in the face and bring him to the [negotiating] table,' Landis said, 'but it's clearly set off dominoes that I don't think anyone expected [to fall].' Landis said there are several reasons for Assad's weakness, including Israel's 'pulling the stuffing out of [his ally] Hezbollah' and the 'relentless Israeli pounding of Syrian government positions' and those of their allies inside the country since the outset of the Gaza conflict on October 7, 2023. Syrian analysts also told Arab media that the Iran-Syria axis 'has been weakened since the road from Tehran to Beirut is no longer open and arms are no longer able to reach Iran's proxy militia allies. In addition, Syrian ally Russia 'has its hands tied at the moment because of its conflict with Ukraine.' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan denied that his government had any responsibility in the Syrian rebel onslaught on Aleppo. 'Turkey is playing an increasing role in trying to achieve peace in the region.' Russian forces reportedly pulled out of several strategic positions in the region overnight, but Russian and Syrian warplanes bombed rebel forces in Aleppo and other parts of the region, causing numerous rebel casualties, according to the Syrian military.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-11-30T15:41:41-08:00	
M23 Rebels ‘Version 2’ Seeks To Build Stronghold In DRC	Heavily armed M23 rebels sat in trucks and on motorcycles at a checkpoint along the Sake-Kilolirwe-Kitshanga road in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They stopped every traveler, took stock of their inventory, demanded a tax payment and issued a hand-written receipt. In a recent report, a cohort of researchers estimated that M23’s extortion of civilians along this single trade route could amount to $69,500 per month. 'Control of roads is a significant strategic issue for obvious military reasons, but also for financing armed groups,' the authors wrote. 'The M23 made significant progress in 2022 along major roads and sought to occupy key crossroads, bridges and commercial hubs in North Kivu. In 2023, the group occupied such crucial commercial centers as Kilolirwe, Kitshanga and Mushaki.' Economic control has been one of the hallmarks of the M23 rebel group as it has seized large swaths of land in the eastern provinces of the DRC. In conducting investigations and surveying locals, the researchers sought to label what they say has been an evolution of the insurgent group, calling it 'Version 2' of the M23. A report published in April by the International Peace Information Service (IPIS) and the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) was based on 57 interviews conducted by the Goma-based civil society organization Association pour le Développement des Initiatives Paysannes. 'The current M23 crisis … is seen as an extension of a war based on the objectives of occupying land and undermining power, particularly customary power,' the report stated. 'In addition to external support from the Rwandan army, the M23 uses several revenue-generating activities within North Kivu.' The researchers concluded that the M23 rebel group is seeking long-term local political power in eastern DRC using historical land disputes, political marginalization and illicit taxation schemes to expand and solidify their authority. Those interviewed included members of M23, as well as Congolese Soldiers, members of armed groups fighting the M23, local chiefs, teachers, traders and farmers who live on the conflict’s frontlines. The United Nations on October 30 reported that 6.9 million people have fled the conflict in eastern DRC, making it one of the world’s largest displacement and humanitarian crises. After lying dormant for 10 years, a unified and resurgent M23 rebel group launched sustained attacks in 2022 in the province of North Kivu and has since fought against Congolese troops, local militias and multinational forces. M23 officials have said their attacks were designed to seize control of and protect land acquired by the ethnic Tutsi community. 'M23, however, has been accused of not just human rights abuses by groups like Human Rights Watch but has also on at least one occasion attacked U.N. peacekeepers who had been tasked with protecting civilians,' security analysis website Geopolitical Monitor wrote in an October 30 situation report. In addition to detailing M23’s elaborate tax scheme in their report, IPIS researcher Ken Matthysen and DIIS senior researcher Peer Schouten examined the insurgent group’s practices of forced labor and illegal exploitation of natural resources, such as timber and charcoal trafficking. 'M23’s disruptive strategy aims to replace Congolese authorities and overhaul local governance in areas it controls in eastern DR Congo,' they wrote in an October 26 article for The Conversation Africa magazine. 'Many Congolese we spoke to perceive M23’s main aim to be control of power at the local level — undermining the existing authorities. 'The group has indeed sought to replace customary authorities with M23-appointed ones, at times assassinating Congolese chiefs. Local sources said M23 even burnt chiefdom archives, destroying evidence of claims to customary authority.' The researchers warn that instability in eastern DRC has deepened since M23’s revival in 2022, as more tribal and ethnic groups have gotten involved. In fighting against M23, the Congolese military has aligned with and given new life to a host of local armed groups under the banner of 'Wazalendo, which is Swahili for 'patriots.' But these fragmented groups also interfere in local governance and extort citizens. 'Instead of curbing the rise of these armed groups, the DRC government has rather legitimized the Wazalendo phenomenon,' the report stated. 'These trends have led to a militarization of the local governance context, which risks jeopardizing future disarmament efforts and pacification in eastern DRC, beyond the current crisis.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YS4bcCK3KK5Z	2024-11-30T15:39:07-08:00	
Georgian President Calls Parliament ‘Illegitimate’ As US Suspends...	(RFE/RL) -- Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, an ardent critic of the ruling Georgian Dream party, called the nation’s parliament illegitimate and vowed to remain in office when her term ends next month, while Washington said it was suspending its 'strategic partnership' with the country. Georgia has been thrown into turmoil since parliamentary elections in October -- in which Georgian Dream secured 54 percent of the vote -- with the opposition and Western governments arguing that the poll was marred by violations and Russian influence. Zurabishvili on November 30 said the 'illegitimate' chamber does not have the right to choose her successor following the end of her term in December and vowed to remain in office. 'There is no legitimate parliament, and therefore, an illegitimate parliament cannot elect a new president,' Zurabishvili said. 'Thus, no inauguration can take place, and my mandate continues until a legitimately elected parliament is formed,' she added, setting up a likely showdown over the office with Georgian Dream. Separately, Washington blasted the security measures used against Georgians who have taken to the streets following the disputed elections and after a November 28 announcement by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze that his government was suspending EU accession talks and would reject budgetary grants from Brussels 'until the end of 2028.' 'The United States condemns the excessive use of force by police against Georgians seeking to exercise their rights to assembly and expression, including their freedom to peacefully protest,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. 'By suspending Georgia’s EU accession process, Georgian Dream has rejected the opportunity for closer ties with Europe and made Georgia more vulnerable to the Kremlin,' he said. 'Georgian Dream’s various anti-democratic actions have violated the core tenets of our U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership, which was based on shared values and commitments to democracy, rule of law, civil society, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and anti-corruption efforts. As a result, the United States has suspended this mechanism.' 'We reiterate our call to the Georgian government to return to its Euro-Atlantic path, transparently investigate all parliamentary election irregularities, and repeal anti-democratic laws that limit freedoms of assembly and expression,' Miller added. More than 100 people were detained in a massive pro-EU rally in Tbilisi on November 29 as Georgian police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters. Georgia's Interior Ministry said protesters had 'verbally and physically' assaulted police officers and had thrown various objects at security forces. Various videos from the rally showed police officers beating protesters. Reacting to the crackdown, Kobakhidze suggested on November 30 that there were 'isolated' incidents of police brutality but 'systemic violence' against security forces by protesters. 'On one side, there was violence, on the other side there were incidents,' he said in a press conference. The opposition called for renewed protests on November 30, with several thousand demonstrators gathering near the parliament waving EU and Georgian flags. Officials said protesters damaged walls of the legislative building using stones and other objects. Police in riot gear used water cannons and tear gas to subdue the crowd shortly after midnight on December 1. Fires were also reported at the parliament grounds. On the first night of protests, some 43 demonstrators were detained 'as a result of illegal and violent actions,' according to the Interior Ministry. Kobakhidze on November 30 said that a 'difficult' few months lay ahead of Georgia but added that he expects relations with the West to 'reset.' Zurabishvili, who has long sided with the protesters, condemned the 'brutal and disproportionate attacks on the Georgian people and media,' likening the crackdown on November 29 to 'Russian-style repression.' The next day, she urged the Georgian diaspora to 'wake up' and help protesters by speaking to the media and appealing to the authorities where they live. '[You] can no longer be silent and pretend nothing is happening in the homeland,' she wrote on Facebook. On November 28, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for new legislative elections in Georgia and sanctions on senior members of the Georgian Dream party. In its resolution, the European Parliament said the election result election did 'not serve as a reliable representation of the will of the Georgian people.' It also called on the European Union, which froze Georgia's EU membership application last month, to place sanctions on key officials within the ruling party, including Kobakhidze, Georgian Dream Chairman Irakli Gharibashvili, billionaire power broker and party founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, and Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YZl7ON-xCkAw	2024-11-30T15:35:43-08:00	
Trump’s Already Rewarding Fossil Fuel Executives For Funding His ...	During his campaign, Donald Trump publicly promised to reward oil and gas executives handsomely in exchange for funding his campaign. Within weeks of winning the election, he’s making good on his promise by tapping oil and gas executive Chris Wright to lead the Department of Energy. Wright has zero experience in running a federal agency. And as the Associated Press reports, he’s 'been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change.' To lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump has picked another crusader against the climate: former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin, who voted in lockstep with fossil fuel interests during his time in Congress. Poll after poll shows a majority of Americans believe climate change is real, human-caused, and needs to be urgently addressed. Trump’s billionaire oil buddies — who will shape national energy policy for the next four years — offer precisely the opposite. Trump has promised to make fuel and energy more affordable for consumers by steering massive profits to energy producers — but those profits will come at our expense. He’s pledged to end federal subsidies for electric vehicles, even though many Americans want zero-emission vehicles but can’t afford them yet. And he’s vowed to bring gas prices under $2 a gallon — a wild claim that economists don’t buy. Oil profits and production are already sky-high under President Biden and haven’t led to lower gas prices. Indeed, Biden has been more of a friend to oil and gas than to climate justice groups. In spite of the White House’s boasts about historic climate policies, Biden’s actions have been relatively toothless. Among them are setting goals posts to reduce emissions years from now — anywhere between 2030 and 2050 — well after he leaves office. He’s touted his signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, as a historic victory for the climate. The law did make significant climate investments, but the majority of it tinkered around the edges of what’s truly needed. And it ended up giving away billions to the fossil fuel industry for unproven technologies such as 'carbon capture.' Indeed, if Trump wants to 'drill baby, drill,' he could thank Biden for paving the way. Biden has overseen the transformation of the U.S. into one of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers, both during his presidency and during the Obama years, when he was vice president. According to the Energy Department, the U.S. has 'produced more crude oil than any nation at any time… for the past six years in a row.' So the last thing the fossil fuel industry needs is more favors. Consumers will pay the price if Trump makes EVs and renewable energy more expensive, lets oil companies dismantle regulations, and accelerates the climate crisis. But he’s relying on ordinary Americans not noticing he’s throwing them and their planet under the bus because of the chaos he’ll bring with mass deportations, anti-LGBT bigotry, and other madness. With the time he has left, Biden could still declare climate change a national emergency — a step many environmental groups are begging him to take, but which he’s resisted throughout his presidency. They’re also calling on him to stop the expansion of export infrastructure for liquefied natural gas. If Biden wants to make any sort of claim to be a climate champion, he’ll take those steps. But ultimately, it will be up to the rest of us to watch what Trump is doing and fight for better climate policies in our own states and communities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YUnurwHCmMdU	2024-11-30T15:33:48-08:00	
Turkish Energy Markets: 2025 Forecasts – OpEd	Turkey's energy sector has witnessed remarkable growth as of 2024. According to data released by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Turkey's installed energy capacity reached 115 MW by the end of November 2024. This reflects the continuous expansion and diversification of the country's energy production capabilities. Distribution of Resources and Energy Plans As per the National Energy Plan, the distribution of installed capacity by source as of July 2024 is as follows: Hydropower: 28.5% Natural gas: 21.9% Coal: 19.3% Wind: 10.9% Solar: 15.6% Geothermal: 1.5% Other sources: 2.4% This distribution underscores the increasing reliance on renewable energy sources while fossil fuels, although declining, still play a significant role. Additionally, landslides in the Afşin-Elbistan coalfields have disrupted operations at the A and B thermal power plants, causing setbacks in coal-based energy production. International Energy Events One of the most significant international energy events of 2024 was the Enlit2024 energy conference and exhibition, held in Milan in November. Despite limited participation from Turkish firms, their expertise in thermal power plant construction provided valuable contributions to the event. The upcoming Enlit2025 will take place next year in Bilbao, Spain, from 18–20 November. Meanwhile, the COP29 Climate and Environment Conference in Baku faced criticism for prioritizing fossil fuels, drawing attention to the urgent need for global energy policies to shift towards sustainability. Notably, COP30 will mark its debut in an Amazonian city, as it is set to take place in Belém, Brazil. Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant and Energy Independence A cornerstone of Turkey's energy strategy, the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, holds significant potential to reduce energy dependence. However, concerns about potential security threats in the region necessitate enhanced safety measures. Moreover, delays in the procurement of critical equipment due to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the European Union have adversely impacted project timelines. While nuclear energy offers significant advantages, the associated risks must be carefully evaluated. Turkey's Natural Gas Supply and the Ukraine War The war in Ukraine has had a direct impact on Turkey's energy relations with Russia. With approximately 40% of Turkey's annual natural gas demand of 56 billion cubic metres supplied by Russia, payment disruptions caused by the conflict have raised energy security concerns. This situation has underscored the necessity of exploring alternative supply routes. Future Outlook The forecasts for 2025 indicate that developments in the energy market will extend beyond production resources, linking directly to the following areas: Energy efficiency Energy storage systems Digitalisation, smart grid technologies, and artificial intelligence applications With its dynamic and innovative structure, Turkey is poised to maintain its position as a strong regional player in energy markets. Increased investments in renewable energy and the acceleration of digital transformation will further strengthen the country's standing on the international energy stage.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YR2gyrfXWndR	2024-11-30T15:27:59-08:00	
China Probes Top Military Official For ‘Serious Violations’	By Qian Lang The ruling Chinese Communist Party has placed Miao Hua, a high-ranking defense official, under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline,' a phrase often used to denote an internal party corruption probe. 'Miao Hua, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the Political Work Department of the Military Commission, is suspected of serious violations of discipline,' defense spokesperson Col. Wu Qian told a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. 'After research by the Party Central Committee, it has been decided to suspend Miao Hua from his duties pending investigation,' Wu said. The announcement came a day after the Financial Times newspaper reported that Admiral Dong Jun, who was named as successor to Li Shangfu in December 2023 after Li was fired for corruption, was himself being investigated for graft. Wu dismissed the report on Thursday as 'pure fabrication and rumor with ulterior motives.' 'China does not accept such reports,' he said, but gave no further details of the investigation into Miao Hua. Current affairs commentator Cai Shenkun said Miao was taken away for investigation on Nov. 9, adding that Dong Jun is his former subordinate. 'Dong Jun was put forward [for defense minister] by Miao Hua, who recommended him to Xi Jinping,' Cai told RFA Mandarin in an interview on Thursday. 'There was a lot of controversy over his appointment, because he had only ever served in the navy, and had never fought on the front line.' He said any corruption on Dong Jun’s part was unlikely to be serious. 'He has never worked in a particularly lucrative department, and naval cadres don’t have that much power anyway,' Cai said. He said if Dong was assisting party investigators with their inquiry, it would like be in the role of Miao’s former subordinate, and that close associates of Miao could fall with him. Refused to meet Austin A former admiral and commander of the Chinese navy, Dong was appointed minister of national defense in December 2023, replacing Li Shangfu who was removed in October 2023 after just seven months in office. The last time Dong appeared in public was on Nov. 21 when he attended the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus in Vientiane, Laos. While holding talks with the defense chiefs of New Zealand, India, and Malaysia, as well as the ASEAN secretary-general, Dong refused a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Beijing blamed it on Washington for undermining China’s 'core interests' by providing weapons to Taiwan. A native of Shandong province from where Xi’s wife Peng Liyuan also hails, Dong –- as well as his predecessor Li Shangfu -– was believed to be appointed by Xi. Yet Dong wasn’t promoted to the Central Military Commission, the top military leadership of the Communist Party, nor was he appointed to the State Council, or the national cabinet. In China, defense ministers are usually members of both those bodies and Dong’s non-appointment had raised questions about his position. Former ministers Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe were expelled from the Communist Party for 'grave discipline violations' such as taking bribes and causing great damage to the images of the party and its senior leaders, according to official statements. Series of sackings The investigation into Miao follows a slew of sackings at the highest levels of the People’s Liberation Army in recent months. Just after Dong was appointed, China expelled nine military officials from its parliament, including three former commanders or vice commanders of the PLA Rocket Force, one former Air Force chief and one Navy commander responsible for the South China Sea. Analysts said they believed that the expulsions were related to the corruption over equipment procurement by the rocket force. But they also link the purges to ongoing dissent within the Chinese military about its readiness to stage an invasion of democratic Taiwan, which has said it has no wish to submit to 'peaceful unification' under Beijing’s territorial claim on the island. An academic who gave only the surname Song for fear of reprisals said Xi’s enthusiasm for an invasion may not be shared by actual military commanders, who fear China may not win such a war. 'Even if the current boss [Xi] wants to attack Taiwan and work with Putin to change the global order for a century to come, real soldiers and generals know whether or not such a war can be won,' Song said. 'The actual military commanders are the ones who know whether their forces are up to the fight, and whether the morale is there.' 'The last two defense ministers, Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, were removed because they knew it couldn’t be won, and mustn’t be fought,' he said. 'That, I think, is the most important reason.' China froze top-level military talks and other dialogue with the U.S. in 2022 after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. official in 25 years to visit Taiwan. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People’s Republic of China, and its 23 million people have no wish to give up their sovereignty or democratic way of life to be ruled by Beijing, according to recent opinion polls. China, which hasn’t ruled out an invasion to force reunification, was infuriated by the Pelosi visit and canceled military-to-military talks, including contacts between theater-level commanders. President Joe Biden persuaded his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to resume contacts in November 2023, when they met on the sidelines of an APEC summit in Woodside, California.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWaXoVfxaADz	2024-11-30T15:23:48-08:00	
A Path Towards Unity: Pope Francis Proposes Joint Catholic-Orthod...	Pope Francis has proposed celebrating the 1,700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea together with Orthodox leaders, in a personal letter to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. The letter, published by the Vatican on Saturday, was delivered by Cardinal Kurt Koch — who heads the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity — during a visit to Istanbul for the patronal feast of the Orthodox Church. 'The now imminent 1700th anniversary of the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea will be another opportunity to bear witness to the growing communion that already exists among all who are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,' Francis wrote in his message dated Nov. 30. Reflecting on six decades of Catholic-Orthodox dialogue while looking ahead to future possibilities for unity, the pope acknowledged the progress made since Vatican II’s Unitatis Redintegratio decree marked the Catholic Church’s official entry into the ecumenical movement 60 years ago. Speaking to EWTN News about this anniversary on Nov. 21, Cardinal Koch emphasized that unity efforts must focus on 'the innermost center of self-revelation in Jesus Christ.' The Swiss cardinal also highlighted what he called an 'ecumenism of blood,' noting that 'Christians are not persecuted because they are Catholic, Lutheran or Anglican, but because they are Christians.' Building peace in a time of war While celebrating the 'renewed fraternity' achieved since Vatican II, Pope Francis noted in his message that full communion, particularly sharing 'the one Eucharistic chalice,' remains an unfulfilled goal. In a pointed observation about contemporary global tensions, the pontiff connected ecumenical efforts to peace-building. 'The fraternity lived and the witness given by Christians will also be a message for our world plagued by war and violence,' he wrote, specifically mentioning Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and Lebanon. The pope also highlighted the recent participation of Orthodox representatives in October’s Synod on Synodality. The traditional exchange of delegations between Rome and Constantinople occurs twice yearly, with Catholic representatives traveling to Istanbul for St. Andrew’s feast on Nov. 30, and Orthodox delegates visiting Rome for the feast of Saints Peter and Paul on Jun. 29. Cardinal Koch led this year’s Vatican delegation. He was accompanied by Archbishop Flavio Pace, Secretary of the Dicastery, Monsignor Andrea Palmieri, Undersecretary, and Archbishop Marek Solczyński, Apostolic Nuncio to Turkey. The delegation participated in the Divine Liturgy at the Patriarchal Church of St. George, Phanar, and held discussions with the synodal commission charged with relations with the Catholic Church.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YcLHTWZQzrvG	2024-11-30T15:20:51-08:00	
The Birmingham Blade: World’s First Geographically Tailored Urban...	AI design specialists EvoPhase and precision metal fabricators Kwik Fab Ltd have unveiled the world’s first urban wind turbine designed by AI, and tailored to the unique wind conditions of a specific geographic area. The team has called it the Birmingham Blade. The collaboration between EvoPhase and Kwik Fab provides a solution to one of the most pressing issues in the green energy landscape – how to produce small-scale, affordable, generators of clean wind energy. EvoPhase used its AI-driven design process to generate and test designs for their efficiency at wind speeds found in Birmingham, which, at 3.6 metres / second are substantially lower than the 10 metres per second rating for most turbines. 'We needed a turbine that could capture Birmingham’s relatively low wind speeds while managing turbulence caused by surrounding buildings,' explained Leonard Nicusan, Chief Technology Officer of EvoPhase. 'The design also had to be compact and lightweight to suit rooftop installations.' EvoPhase found the optimal design for curved blades which spin around a central point, and confirmed that that it will be up to seven times more efficient than existing designs used in the Birmingham area. Leonard explained why it was necessary to use AI to generate the design: 'Using AI was essential for breaking free from the long-standing biases that have influenced turbine designs for the past century. AI allowed us to explore design possibilities beyond the scope of traditional human experimentation. We were able to generate, test, and refine over 2,000 wind turbine designs in just a few weeks, significantly accelerating our development process and achieving what would have taken years and millions of pounds through conventional methods.' 'Our evolutionary simulations have confirmed the Birmingham Blade is up to seven times more efficient than existing designs in Birmingham’s wind speeds and urban environment. The final design is not just a prototype — it is a predictive solution that is ready for real-world use.' Developed by a research group led by Dr Kit Windows-Yule at the University of Birmingham, EvoPhase’s AI-led evolutionary design process mimics natural selection, this approach allows for simultaneous optimisation of many different parameters, avoiding traditional trade-offs between performance factors. Kwik Fab produced the first iteration of the Birmingham Blade to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing the design. An aluminium version will be sited on a roof space in Birmingham for evaluation and testing, and the final product is expected to be available by late 2025. The EvoPhase – Kwik Fab collaboration provides a rapid design and prototyping service, and the team is now working on another design for the very different conditions in Edinburgh. Paul Jarvis from Kwik Fab is confident that there is sufficient talent and space in Birmingham to deliver quick turnaround from design to prototyping for wind turbines that are geographically tailored to specific local conditions around the rest of the world. He said: 'We can take a complex design, and manufacture and ship a prototype for testing within weeks. We’d like to work with organisations that want to make the most of wind power, a source of sustainable energy that is free, and present in every country.' Since its launch in 2023, EvoPhase has expanded its AI-powered evolutionary design approach to industries beyond wind energy, including the optimisation of equipment for mixing, blending, and storing granular materials in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical manufacturing sectors. EvoPhase’s collaboration with Kwik Fab demonstrates the broad applicability of their predictive designs. It was made possible in part by the Manchester Prize which named the team as a finalist in the inaugural year of the prize in May 2024. The Manchester Prize is a multi-million-pound challenge prize from the UK’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to reward UK-led breakthroughs in artificial intelligence for public good.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWqHR2pT8OjE	2024-11-30T15:19:49-08:00	
Scientists Reveal Possible Role Of Iron Sulfides In Creating Life...	An international team of scientists recently published a study highlighting the potential role of iron sulfides in the formation of life in early Earth’s terrestrial hot springs. According to the researchers, the sulfides may have catalyzed the reduction of gaseous carbon dioxide into prebiotic organic molecules via nonenzymatic pathways. This work, which appeared in Nature Communications, offers new insights into Earth’s early carbon cycles and prebiotic chemical reactions, underscoring the significance of iron sulfides in supporting the terrestrial hot springs origin of life hypothesis. The study was conducted by Dr. NAN Jingbo from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dr. LUO Shunqin from Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science, Dr. Quoc Phuong Tran from the University of New South Wales, Australia, and other researchers. Iron sulfides, abundant in early Earth’s hydrothermal systems, may have facilitated essential prebiotic chemical reactions, similar to the function of cofactors in modern metabolic systems. Previous studies on iron sulfides and the origin of life have focused primarily on deep-sea alkaline hydrothermal vents, which provide favorable conditions like high temperature, pressure, pH gradients, and hydrogen (H₂) from serpentinization—factors thought to support prebiotic carbon fixation. However, some scientists have proposed terrestrial hot springs as another plausible setting for life’s origins, due to their rich mineral content, diverse chemicals, and abundant sunlight. To explore the role of iron sulfides in terrestrial prebiotic carbon fixation, the research team synthesized a series of nanoscale iron sulfides from mackinawite, including pure iron sulfide and iron sulfides doped with common hot spring elements such as manganese, nickel, titanium, and cobalt. Their experiments showed that these iron sulfides could catalyze the H₂-driven reduction of CO₂ at specific temperatures (80–120 °C) and atmospheric pressure. Gas chromatography was used to quantify the methanol production . The study found that manganese-doped iron sulfides exhibited notably high catalytic activity at 120 °C. This activity was further enhanced by UV-visible (300–720 nm) and UV-enhanced (200–600 nm) light, suggesting that sunlight might play a role in driving this reaction by facilitating chemical processes. Additionally, the introduction of water vapor boosted catalytic activity, further supporting that vapor-laden terrestrial hot springs may have served as key sites for nonenzymatic organic synthesis on early Earth. To further investigate the mechanism behind the H₂-driven CO₂ reduction, the team conducted in-situ analyses using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Results indicated that the reaction likely proceeds via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) pathway, in which CO₂ is first reduced to carbon monoxide (CO), which is subsequently hydrogenated to form methanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided additional insights, revealing that manganese doping not only lowered the reaction’s activation energy but also introduced highly efficient electron transfer sites, thereby enhancing reaction efficiency. The redox characteristics of iron sulfides make them functionally analogous to modern metabolic enzymes, providing a chemical foundation for prebiotic carbon fixation. This research underscores the potential of iron sulfides to catalyze prebiotic carbon fixation in early Earth’s terrestrial hot springs, opening new directions for exploring life’s origins and supporting efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4Yc7LdlTCiexP	2024-11-30T15:19:06-08:00	
A New Approach To Predicting Malaria Drug Resistance	Researchers at University of California San Diego analyzed the genomes of hundreds of malaria parasites to determine which genetic variants are most likely to confer drug resistance. The findings, published in Science, could help scientists use machine learning to predict antimalarial drug resistance and more effectively prioritize the most promising experimental treatments for further development. The approach could also help predict treatment resistance in other infectious diseases, and even cancer. 'A lot of drug resistance research can only look at one chemical agent at a time, but what we’ve been able to do here is create a roadmap for understanding antimalaria drug resistance across more than a hundred different compounds,' said Elizabeth Winzeler, Ph.D., a professor at UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Department of Pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine. 'These results will be useful for other diseases as well, because many of the resistant genes we studied are conserved across different species.' Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, is a major public health threat in many tropical and subtropical regions. Despite considerable progress toward controlling the disease, malaria remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in Africa, where 95% of malaria deaths occur according to the World Health Organization. First-line drugs have repeatedly failed due to the spread of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. 'The need for new, more effective malaria treatments is urgent, but funding for malaria research and drug development is very limited,' said Winzeler, who in addition to her role at UC San Diego is director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Malaria Drug Accelerator. 'However, the malaria research community is organized and highly collaborative, and our study was able to leverage these strengths to create a resource that will make the process of identifying and prioritizing new malaria treatments significantly easier.' The researchers analyzed the genomes of 724 malaria parasites evolved in the lab to resist one of 118 different antimalarial compounds, including both established treatments and new experimental agents. By looking for patterns in the mutations that were associated with resistance, the researchers were able to identify unique features of these genetic variants, such as their physical location within genes, that could be used to predict which variations are likely to contribute to drug resistance. 'Our ultimate goal is to use machine learning to help us understand which compounds have the most risk of being compromised by resistance so that we can streamline the early drug development process and ultimately get treatments into clinical trials faster,' said Winzeler. 'This study gives us the data needed to train these new tools.' 'The study also uncovers how networks of genes come together to mediate resistance across chemical classes, and provides a road map as we search for resistance-refractory compounds,' adds David Fidock, Ph.D., coauthor and a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. While the findings have significant implications for the development of new antimalarial drugs, the researchers also highlight that their approach could be relevant across different diseases. This is because the genetic machinery driving drug resistance is consistent across different pathogens and even within human cells. For example, many of the resistance-driving mutations identified in the study were from a protein in P. falciparum parasites, called PfMDR1, that can move substances between various parts of the cell, including transporting drugs away from their site of action. PfMDR1 has an exact counterpart in humans, and mutations in the human version are one of the key drivers of treatment resistance in cancer. 'The potential impact of this study is huge and extends well beyond a single disease,' said Winzeler. 'Studying malaria gave us the opportunity to put this resource together, and we hope that these findings will help change the way we study drug resistance as a whole, not just in malaria.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWR-gT2ZIAJz	2024-11-30T15:18:02-08:00	
EU-Turkmenistan: New Strategic Partners	Central Asia is increasingly drawing the attention of Europeans, particularly in the aftermath of the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. Since 2022, European countries have been striving to diversify their energy partners, among which are the nations of Central Asia. One of the key players in this gas-rich region is Turkmenistan. This country has the potential to become a major gas exporter to Europe. This is precisely why interactions between the EU and Turkmenistan are growing, especially in Brussels, the heart of the European Union. The EU frequently meets with Turkmen representatives, including the ambassador, to strengthen cooperation in the energy sector. This Central Asian country has the potential to supply large volumes of gas in all directions in the coming years. The South Yolotan gas field, believed to be the second-largest in the world, boasts reserves of 21 trillion cubic meters. According to Ibrayeva et al. (2018:152), Turkmenistan is the only Central Asian source capable of exporting significant amounts of gas to Europe. Furthermore, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that the region will become a major gas exporter, with total production rising from 143 billion cubic meters in 2009 to 265 billion cubic meters by 2035 (Gas Trade Flows in Europe, 2010; Teleuyev et al., 2017).

Statistical Review of World energy Turkmenistan: A Strategic Energy Partner for the European Union Turkmenistan pursues a multi-sector diplomacy strategy, with the European Union being one of its many partners. In the coming years, this Central Asian nation is poised to supply significant quantities of gas in various directions. The South Yolotan gas field, with estimated reserves of 21 trillion cubic meters, is regarded as the second-largest gas field in the world. Revenue from gas exports constitutes a significant portion of Turkmenistan’s national budget, prompting Ashgabat to seek diverse energy partners while bypassing Russian territories. Since its independence, Turkmenistan has worked to reduce its reliance on Moscow’s energy policies, initially exporting gas to Iran and subsequently to China. The government remains proactive in diversifying its partnerships. Ambassador Palvanov presented NE Global with various examples of the growing cooperation between his country and the EU, starting with trade, connectivity and energy. Speaking about the level of bilateral cooperation this year, the Ambassador wished to highlight the recent visit of Rashid Meredov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan to Brussels and his meetings with EU leaders, as well as a round table with the participation of European businesses and various institutions. These interactions led to the launch of a working group on energy in April and increased interest of European businesses and investments in the Turkmen market. According to Sapar Palvanov: Turkmenistan and Europe have significant potential for cooperation in many key areas, such as sectors from energy to transport and regional security. Turkmenistan is actively working on diversifying its energy policy. That is why Turkmenistan wants to intensify its exchanges with Europe on the topic of green economy (Grandesso, F. 2024, June 4). A Strategic Energy Partner for the EU On May 26, 2008, Andris Piebalgs, then European Commissioner for Energy, signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Turkmenistan in the presence of the country’s then-President, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. The agreement aimed to strengthen mutual cooperation in the energy sector. 'Turkmenistan can be an attractive destination for EU investments in the development of new oil and gas fields, while the EU offers an appealing consumer market for Turkmen energy products. Today’s agreement clearly demonstrates the mutual benefits of a constructive and mutually beneficial energy relationship,' said Mr. Piebalgs. EU-Turkmenistan: Multilevel Cooperation Under its Central Asia strategy, the EU collaborates with Turkmenistan across various fields, including education, environmental protection, and economic development. The EU’s Central Asia Strategy of June 2019 and the accompanying Council Conclusions provide a comprehensive framework for regional engagement. Bilateral relations between the EU and Turkmenistan are governed by the Interim Trade Agreement, which came into effect in August 2010. The European External Action Service (EEAS) highlights the EU’s intention to deepen its dialogue and cooperation with Turkmenistan. Interparliamentary relations are conducted through EU-Turkmenistan Inter-Parliamentary Meetings, the latest of which (7th) was held in Brussels on November 14, 2024. Neutrality as a Tool for Regional Stability The Status of Permanent Neutrality as a Regional Stabilizer Turkmenistan’s status of permanent neutrality has significantly contributed to its role in promoting regional stability and combating shared threats such as terrorism, drug trafficking, violent extremism, and transnational organized crime. On December 12, 1995, the United Nations General Assembly officially recognized this neutrality through a resolution. This status has enabled Turkmenistan to maintain positive relations with major powers, becoming a cornerstone of its foreign policy. It allows the country to navigate complex international dynamics with a degree of independence. Cooperation in Sustainable Development The Turkmen government, fully aware of the urgency of climate action, is committed to advancing environmental and climate initiatives in collaboration with the European Union. For example, the EU launched the 2024-2028 Political Dialogue and Climate Action initiative for a greener Turkmenistan following a meeting in Ashgabat. In his opening remarks, Borislav Dimitrov, Program Director at the EU Delegation to Turkmenistan, highlighted the Turkmen government’s dedication to climate agendas. He expressed confidence that this mutually beneficial project would foster dialogue and establish a strategic partnership. The European Union is committed to supporting Turkmenistan’s transition to a sustainable, green economy while simultaneously improving its business environment. This commitment is reflected in the EU-Turkmenistan Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters, which has been in effect since August 2010. This agreement lays the groundwork for the anticipated ratification of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) by the European Parliament. Climate Commitments Turkmenistan recognizes the importance of the global climate agenda and has implemented measures at national, regional, and international levels, as noted by the Green Central Asia initiative, launched by Germany in 2020. Internationally, Turkmenistan has ratified key climate-related conventions, supported the Paris Agreement, and committed through its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels under a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. The Ambassador said that Turkmenistan and the European Union aim to attract advanced European technologies to Turkmenistan to diversify and modernize their economy. During an interview for neglobal.eu, Turkmen Ambassador Sapar Palvanov stressed that Turkmenistan considers the EU Green Deal as an important and commendable initiative that is in line with their commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection. He said that his government recognizes the importance of the transition to green energy and is actively investing in renewable energy projects, especially hydrogen and solar energy (Grandesso, F. (2024, June 4). Interview: EU and Turkmenistan are getting closer. Retrieved from Conclusion In July 2019, the European Union established a full-fledged delegation in Turkmenistan, signaling mutual strategic interest in enhancing relations. Since then, the number of business and official delegations visiting Turkmenistan has grown significantly, reflecting the strengthening ties between the two. In summary, energy relations between the European Union and Turkmenistan have intensified over the past decade. Amid the Russo-European 'energy chess game,' the EU has recognized Turkmenistan as a strategic partner for developing economic relations. Since the Russia-Ukraine war, Turkmenistan has emerged as a potentially decisive player in supplying gas to the EU. BIBLIOGRAPHY Admin. (2024, September 16).

Post-Hasina Bangladesh: Realigning Parties? – OpEd	Configurations of political parties in Bangladesh now carry multiple drifts---they are still inchoate after a long hiatus under an authoritarian stretch of fifteen plus years. But the parties got a new lease of life since a populist revolt ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s (Hasina) repressive regime. Now they are optimistic, alive, and thrusting. The expected contestants are mobilizing resources for the future electoral race. Bangladeshis love politics, even though their success in institution-building fell short of expectations on multiple occasions. Historically, parties 'formed 'with a great ease in colonial and post-colonial Bengal; then bulk of those outfits did not grow for long. Factional and personal rivalries are still so strong in Bengali political culture. Single party domination, personalistic hegemony and the familiar dynastic claims characterized the rise and fall of parties in the past. Among the squirming parties in post-Hasina Bangladesh, I sense an ideological jolt. The Awami League (AL)-centric secular-liberal nationalism, with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib) as the 'Jatir Pita' has lost its pitch since the July-August’s tectonic discontent.A fresh sense of patriotism is, however, yet to come out lucidly ---it is even short of catchy slogans and rhetoric to attract public attention. Anti-Indian and anti-AL postures are the twins in the new mood in Bangladesh, which, of course, have their challengers—both internal and external. India is important to Bangladesh; on the other side, Bangladesh is too crucial for Indian security in the Northeastern states. So, New Delhi might try to reinstate Hasina or her AL allies back in Bangladesh. Nostalgia for the bygone Hasina regime among her surviving beneficiaries is still amongst the AL leftovers, anxious to return to power by hook or crook. The troubled AL will really have its own existential crisis if a band of its leaders, not directly associated with Hasina’s tyrannical regime, would jettison the old guards---the Mujib family, and recycle themselves as the new-fangled AL. Neither the caretaker regime nor the BNP or Jamaat is ruling out such possibilities. AL gained its historic thrust in 1971, which, of course, went adrift after the 1975 violent coup. Much later, it regained vigorously first since the 1996 election victory and then more solidly after the 2008 electoral triumph. Has the one-time mighty AL lost its previous momentum? Hasina’s prolonged autocracy destroyed a large and established party from within itself. Neither Mujib nor Hasina fully trusted the party though both used the party to climb the ladder of power. Mujib stabbed the party on the back by creating the BKSAL single party system, and Hasina preferred to rule by creating an oligarchy of corrupt businesspeople, crony politicians, sycophants, politicians, politicized bureaucrats, police, and henchmen. Will post-Hasina Bangladesh wipe out the Mujib-Hasina brand of politics? In that case, the AL might lose its deceptive Indian patronage. India is the dominant power in the region and the regional actors are careful in dealing with the neighborhood juggernaut. The BNP, now buoyant about its impending return to power, would avoid any direct confrontation with the next-door giant. Even the Jamaat-e-Islami (Jamaat) has sent 'soft' messages to India. None of the leaders of those two major parties aggressively demanded AL’s ban. Rumors floated that the AL leadership would change, and it was willing to connect with the BNP for certain areas of common concerns. The BNP wanted legal actions and punishments for Hasina, and her associates for their tyrannical intransigence, and wanton deaths and destruction in July-August 2024. So far, the BNP did not strongly demand for the AL’s ban, but the leaders of the unbridled civil unrest denounced AL as a fascist outfit that did not deserve a slot in a democracy. A disconnect exists between the majority Bangladeshi parties and the student leaders who steered the furious anti-Hasina crusade---they want a radical change with a 'revolutionary' zeal by upending the entire post-1971 political narrative including its historiography and the sense of identity. They condemn the AL’s exclusionary path and its alleged collusion with New Delhi to turn Bangladesh into a 'vassal state' of India. The timeworn Bangladeshi consensus, so long defined by the AL-delineated post-1971 Chetona that deified late Sheikh Mujib and sustained Sheikh Hasina’s prolonged tyranny is all but shattered since the July-August revolt. The conventional parties, including the BNP, the Jamaat and the lessor parties, would prefer to return to power soon by a majoritarian party rule or by sharing power by a coalition of like-minded parties. The smaller parties, however, want a proportional representation, which ordinarily gives better power-sharing opportunities to the minor parties. The protest leaders and the smaller parties also want the proportional representation (PR) as a tool to fight against the single party hegemony in Bangladesh. But the larger parties, both the BNP and the AL, are reluctant to give up the existing majority-style voting system. If Bangladesh switches to a proportional representation, the world of political parties will change substantially. The student leaders of the July-August upheavals opposed the main parties’ dynastic leadership, which turned them against both the ousted AL and the BNP. Both the parties carry the family names at their highest echelon. The simmering encounter between the BNP and the protest leaders was clear recently when the BNP turned down the student leaders’ demand for the Bangladesh president’s immediate resignation. Senior BNP leaders are trying to establish the party’s relevance to post-Hasina Bangladesh politics. BNP’s front runners are active in the media. Out of her contrived jail sentence, Begum Khaleda Zia (Khaleda) is looking for a better health care abroad and Tarek Zia, the BNP’s president-in-charge is more visible on social media. More prospective candidates are lobbying for the BNP tickets in the next election, for which no date came out, so far. Will the Samannayyakari (coordinating) student leaders float a party, as the rumor goes on? Neither the student campaigners nor Dr. Mohammad Yunus’s cabinet, so far, produced a clear political vision about their future. Spectacular political changes resulted from the student-led protests in the bygone. I remember the massive events that goaded East Pakistan Chief Minister Abu Hossain Sarker’s government to resign in 1956; it was the AL leader Ataur Rahman Khan who headed the succeeding government. Now, the caretaker authority is running the administration until the next election. There was a time when the digits of '1971' carried the 'short-handed' message for pruning Jamaat out of politics, as I read this in the past. Now, Jamaat’s greatest achievement is that the party, as a movement, could survive undercover, when necessary, and still explode as a big blow to its political adversaries. Jamaat’s student front, the Shibir has a place in the student Samannya committee that has worked with Dr. Yunus. BNP has maintained its unity during its trying times. And now, it is the largest party in Bangladesh with bright electoral prospects ahead. No longer, dependent on the BNP’s mercy, Jamaat has moved from the periphery to the center of Bangladesh politics. Islamic politics is not the monopoly of Jamaat, although it is the largest party upholding political Islam in Bangladesh. Few can predict now if Jamaat will go to the poll alone or as a coalition of the Islamic parties. Smaller parties also hope for its share in the Bangladeshi arena of politics. Evolving configuration of the BNP and Jamaat will substantively impact the future Bangladeshi party politics. What happened earlier this year ripped through the Bangladeshi psyche while people feel empowered by the populist stump that ejected the Hasina rule. That colossal uprising worked like a referendum against Hasina’s unbending authoritarianism and crimes against humanity. But the main discourse of the revolt is yet to appear as a coherent institutional expression. Which of the established parties would embrace the July-August protest’s counter-narrative? The perceived relief is that the AL’s archaic single party ascendency is not on its brutal rampage in Bangladesh now. And the rhetorical temperature against the Jamaat and the old fearmongering about Islamic terrorism have significantly subsided. Bangladeshis, however, still acknowledge that parties are the essential vehicles for the parliamentary democracy that they cherish so much. The lingering polarization, periodic lawlessness, disagreements and discontent over constitutional and institutional reforms and the absence of a roadmap for the next election are creating a chasm between the parties and the interim regime. Fear of internal instability and external interference on different pretexts wrestles a necessary consensus before the return of an elected and stable governance.

VIT Bhopal University Hosts An international Conference On Humani...	A two-day international conference on 'Humanities and Beyond Humanities: A Critical Approach to Language, Literature, Media, and Management Studies (ICHBH - 2024)' was organized by the School of Advanced Sciences and Languages (SASL), English Division, VIT Bhopal University, M.P, India, in collaboration with AAB College, Prishtina, Republic of Kosova, academic partner Emerald Publishing, media partner Conference Alert. The Conference took place on the main campus of VIT Bhopal University on 21-22 November 2024. This intellectually inspiring event encompassed speeches and statements by University Professors coming from South America and other regions of India. A highlight of keynote speeches, discussions follow: Prof. Benjamin Fernandez Bogado, a journalist and university Professor, Republic of Paraguay, addressed the growing concern of new technologies and how the world has become smaller and isolated, challenges faced by people along with the need of comprehending the sense of humanism and even more by excelling, going beyond humanities to live in a society. In his speech, Prof. Benjamin Fernandez Bogado, stated: 'The world has become even smaller, and people are more isolated in their individualism, and it must restore a reinvention of socialization, which is the only human experience that is new and distinctive from other living species. Fascinated by technology, we have lost closeness and social proximity. We must recover interpersonal communication and face-to-face dialogue, for the social good and for the very human dimension of these times.' According to Fernandez Bogado, 'Our life, in many cases reduced to algorithms capable of recognizing our tastes and tendencies, has served well to place commercial products and some politicians with greater success, in our daily lives. We have become spies of ourselves, as Byung-Chul Han, a South Korean-born philosopher and cultural theorist living in Germany, has defined very well. We are feeding a monster that, with artificial intelligence, is nothing other than the accumulation of data and information, but that has no feeling, does not project itself onto others, but rather strengthens the individual experience that does not require anyone else to develop this knowledge. An artificial intelligence that does not need anyone else to understand and to project itself. This indeed is a mistake.' Fernandez Bogado noted that, 'As never before, the failure of commercial globalization must lead us to reinvent a world with deeply ingrained values where we recognize ourselves in other people. Let us achieve what Hannah Arendt, a German American historian and philosopher, has stated: otherness. Putting ourselves in the dimension of the other in order to be the other. The new globalization cannot be reduced to the trade of products, it must be the human conquest in its projected dimension associated with the other.' In the keynote session, Prof. Peter M. Tase, Chief Guest and Keynote speaker, from National University of the East (Universidad Nacional del Este), Ciudad del Este, Republic of Paraguay, addressed the challenges faced by humanism and social sciences, asserting that such international conferences revitalize research and promote understanding of these fields. He attended in present this conference. Dr. Amitabh Kodwani, IIM Indore, emphasized the importance of integrating humanities and engineering. He explained that while both embrace different approaches to problem-solving, their convergence fosters new perspectives and better ways of living. Dr. Sumit Narula, Emerald Publishing House, highlighted the growing significance of digital humanities, emphasizing its bright future. He stressed the need for humanities professionals to acquire coding knowledge, given the changing dynamics of education. Prof. K.M. Pandey, BHU, Varanasi, delved into the philosophical and practical aspects of life, underscoring the importance of self-inquiry and balance. Prof. Dr. Robert H. Bishop, Vice Chancellor for Engineering, The Texas A&M University System and Dean of Engineering (Texas A&M University), USA, was the Guest of Honor who joined (Online).

Engaging North Korea: Prospects And Challenges Of Another Trump-K...	The potential for President-elect Donald Trump to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un presents a unique opportunity to tackle two critical global issues: North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its expanding military alliance with Russia, which has significant implications for both the Ukraine conflict and stability in Northeast Asia. This essay examines the challenges and prospects of such a meeting, juxtaposing Trump's direct engagement approach with President Biden's multilateral strategy. It also considers the roles of South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia in shaping outcomes, arguing that Trump’s use of 'carrot and stick' diplomacy must be carefully balanced to achieve meaningful progress. Success hinges on harmonizing incentives with firm deterrence while addressing North Korea’s destabilizing actions, particularly its military support for Russia. The results of this engagement could reshape U.S.-North Korean relations and influence broader regional security dynamics in 2024 and beyond. Background: U.S.- North Korea Relations and Current Challenges Historical Context The U.S. relationship with North Korea has fluctuated between periods of heightened tension and cautious diplomacy. Trump's historic summits with Kim Jong-un in 2018 and 2019 aimed to establish trust and negotiate denuclearization. However, the absence of substantive agreements and North Korea’s continued weapons development highlighted the limitations of these discussions. North Korea’s Strategic Shift North Korea has increasingly aligned itself with Russia, supplying military aid—such as ammunition and troops—to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. This partnership enhances Pyongyang’s access to resources and advanced technology, undermining international sanctions. North Korea's military activities, including missile launches and advancements in satellite technology, further threaten regional stability. The Significance of Trump Engagement Trump’s diplomacy offers a chance to reframe negotiations. His readiness to directly engage with adversaries distinguishes him from Biden’s focus on building multilateral alliances and applying pressure. However, critics warn that Trump’s approach risks legitimizing Kim’s regime without securing meaningful concessions. The Problem: Risks and Barriers to Progress North Korea’s Role in Global Conflicts North Korea’s military partnership with Russia complicates diplomatic efforts. By providing ammunition and personnel, Pyongyang not only supports Russia’s campaign in Ukraine but also strengthens its military-industrial complex. This dual advantage empowers North Korea to resist international pressure while advancing its nuclear ambitions. The Deadlock on Denuclearization Achieving denuclearization remains a significant challenge. North Korea views its nuclear program as essential to the survival of its regime and as a means to counter perceived U.S. aggression. Previous negotiations have stalled due to Pyongyang's refusal to dismantle its substantial arsenal without first obtaining sanctions relief. Regional Concerns and Mistrust U.S. allies in the region, particularly South Korea and Japan, worry that unilateral U.S.-North Korea discussions may overlook their security priorities. Both nations emphasize the necessity of a coordinated approach that bolsters deterrence and maintains regional stability. Opportunities: The Potential of a Trump-Kim Meeting Reopening Dialogue A meeting between Trump and Kim could revitalize stalled negotiations, establishing a platform for discussions on denuclearization and regional security. Trump's strategy of direct engagement may ease tensions and create opportunities for gradual progress. Economic Incentives Trump's 'carrot and stick' approach could provide North Korea with tangible incentives, such as partial sanctions relief or economic aid, in exchange for verified steps towards disarmament. These measures may address Pyongyang’s urgent economic issues and promote goodwill. Weakening the North Korea-Russia Alliance By addressing North Korea’s military support for Russia, Trump could undermine this partnership, reducing Pyongyang’s reliance on Moscow and limiting its access to essential resources. Emphasizing the risks associated with continued isolation might spur North Korea to reassess its strategic alliances. Stakeholder Perspectives South Korea South Korea advocates for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and condemns North Korea’s provocations. Seoul highlights the importance of U.S. commitments to its defence and insists that any agreements with Pyongyang must preserve regional stability. Japan Japan's primary concern is North Korea’s missile capabilities, which pose a direct threat to its security. Tokyo supports a firm stance on denuclearization and insists that any concessions be contingent upon concrete actions from Pyongyang. China China's relationship with North Korea is complex, as it balances economic support with a desire to prevent regional instability. While Beijing opposes North Korea’s military provocations, it also views Pyongyang as a buffer against U.S. influence in Asia. Russia Russia benefits from its alliance with North Korea, gaining critical military support while providing Pyongyang with food and resources. Moscow’s role complicates efforts to isolate North Korea and underscores the interconnectedness of global conflicts. Recommendations for Trump Strategy Confront Military Ties with Russia Trump should address North Korea’s arms transfers to Russia, highlighting the global repercussions of these actions. By offering targeted incentives, such as food or economic relief, he could potentially weaken the Pyongyang-Moscow partnership. Clear Incentives and Penalties A balanced approach that combines economic incentives with enforceable penalties for non-compliance is crucial. Clear benchmarks for progress, such as a freeze on missile tests should guide negotiations. Reinforce Regional Alliances Involving South Korea and Japan in the negotiation process will ensure regional support and strengthen collective security. Maintaining transparency and coordination with allies is essential for building trust and deterring North Korean aggression. Engage Multilateral Stakeholders Involving China and Russia in discussions could help reduce their support for North Korea and encourage compliance with international norms. Multilateral forums provide a platform to address the broader implications of North Korea’s actions. Conclusion Trump’s proposed meeting with Kim Jong-un presents a unique opportunity to tackle some of the most urgent security challenges for 2024. By utilizing his personal diplomacy style and adopting a balanced 'carrot and stick' approach, Trump can work towards reducing tensions, promoting denuclearization, and undermining North Korea’s destabilizing alliance with Russia. Success will depend on careful coordination with regional allies, strategic engagement with China and Russia, and a commitment to actionable outcomes. The stakes of this engagement are significant, but with a clear strategy, it could represent a pivotal moment in U.S.-North Korea relations and overall regional security.

Growing Hindu-Muslim Tension In Bangladesh Widens Rift With India...	Since the issues involved have domestic implications, domestic politics in the two countries tend to vitiate the atmosphere and exacerbate the tension. Relations between Bangladesh and India, which nosedived following the ouster of the Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August, appears set to deteriorate further. A sharpening of Muslim-Hindu conflict in Chittagong, the second most important part of Bangladesh after capital Dhaka, has exacerbated tension with India further. The Hindu-Muslim conflict, which is at the root of the tension now, is embedded in the domestic politics of both Bangladesh and India. That has its own dynamics, exacerbating tension and making it doubly difficult to solve. The port city and trading centre of Chittagong has been a hotbed of ethnic, linguistic and religious conflict for decades. Earlier, the fight was between Bengali Muslims and the indigenous Buddhist Chakma tribe in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). Now it is a fight between the Bengali Muslim majority (87%) and the Bengali Hindus (11%) in the whole of Chittagong. While Muslims are seen by Hindus as being backed by the Bangladeshi State, the Hindus are perceived by the Muslims to be backed by Bangladesh's neighbour and regional power, India, where an aggressive Hindu nationalism is ruling the roost. During the violent mass movement of July-August this year which ousted Sheikh Hasina, agitators attacked numerous Hindu properties as Hindus were seen as Hasina's support base. These attacks instilled mortal fear among the Hindus whose population had already dwindled from about 30% in 1947 to about 8% due to continuous State-backed Islamic intolerance over the years. However, the communal situation in Bangladesh as a whole calmed down in November and this year's Durga festival of the Hindus went off without any incident. But trouble was brewing in Chittagong, which has traditionally been a bastion of Islamic radicalism and also Hindu assertion, according to Afsan Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi social and political commentator. The headquarters of the Hefazat-e-Islam (Protection of Islam) with its large network of Madrasahs, are in Chittagong. The Hefazat stands for Sharia in Bangladesh. Because of its control of the Madrassahs it has been wooed by Hasina's Awami League as well as Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Hefazat for example made Hasina cut off Hindu authors from Bangladeshi school text books. Islamists of Chittagong have been looking at the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) as a proselytizing organization with a strong base in India and Western countries. In the popular imagination, ISKCON is seen as an arm of India. The Hefazat and the Jamaat-e-Islami have even called for a ban on it. The Bangladesh High Court has refused to ban the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). On their part, militant Hindus had recently organized massive demonstrations and threatened to march to Dhaka if the Interim Government failed to protect the community from Islamists and anti-Hasina forces. The recent trouble was sparked off when the Hindu organization Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote held a demonstration in which its flag was seen flying above the Bangladeshi national flag. For this, monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari of the Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote was arrest amidst a skirmish between his followers and the police. In the clash, Assistant Public Prosecutor Sayful Islam Alif was killed. Sayful is said to be a Jammat-i-Islami man who had sought a ban on ISKCON. However, ISKCON made it clear at a press conference that monk Chinmoy had been expelled from ISKCON earlier for misbehaving with a child. Therefore, the organisation would not shoulder any responsibility over his statements. ISKCON Bangladesh's general secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari, in a written statement, said that Leelaraj Gour Das, head of Prabartak Sri Krishna Mandir, Gaurang Das, and Chinmoy Krishna Das, head of Sri Sri Pundarik Dham in Chattogram, were expelled from ISKCON Bangladesh for breaching discipline of the organisation in July. That's why any actions of these individuals do not represent ISKCON Bangladesh, the statement said. However, the allegations stuck to ISKCON and created waves in India. Sayful Islam Alif's funeral was attended by leaders of the students' movement which ousted Sheikh Hasina in August. Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD), demanded the arrest of ISKCON persons allegedly involved in the killing of the lawyer within the next 24 hours. Hasnat Abdulla also demanded a ban on ISKCON, saying: 'There will be co-existence of all religions in our country, and we will work to protect the rights of all. But if an extremist organisation is run in the name of religion, they will not be given space here. My brother Sayful has been murdered brutally. ISKCON must be banned as a terrorist organisation.' Hasnat Abdullah alleged that ISKCON was in favour of the fallen Hasina regime. 'We did not forget how the ISKCON created anarchy in Bangladesh, in favour of dictator Awami League as per the prescription of India. The people of Bangladesh will resist whatever conspiracies are hatched from India. We want to say categorically that Awami League will never be rehabilitated in Bangladesh,' he thundered. As per media reports, Chinmoy is a radical leader too. Speaking at a mass rally in Chittagong's Laldighi ground he had said: 'If anyone wants to evict us (the Hindus) from this country and live in peace, it will become Afghanistan or Syria. There will be no democratic force. Bangladesh will become a sanctuary of communalism.' The arrest of Chinmoy produced reverberations in New Delhi. The Indian External Affairs Ministry (MEA) expressed 'deep concern'. In a statement it said: 'This incident follows multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh'. The MEA called upon the interim government of Bangladesh to 'ensure safety and security of Hindus and all minorities.' New Delhi is annoyed by regular declarations from the leaders of the Interim government, including Chief Advisor Dr.Muhammad Yunus, that Hasina would be brought back from refuge in India, to face trial. However, till date, Dhaka has not formally asked for her extradition, perhaps not to put New Delhi in a fix. Responding to New Delhi's remarks, Dhaka said Delhi's statement was 'contrary to facts.' A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh said that India had remarked 'on a matter concerning the internal affairs of Bangladesh', and said, 'such unfounded statements not only misrepresent facts but also stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighbouring countries'. The Bangladesh government also described the killing of advocate Sayful Alif as 'brutal'. With the Indian media being spiteful about the peoples' movement against Hasina, linking it to Islamic extremism and Pakistan's machinations, and the Bangladeshi media harping on alleged Indian conspiracies to dominate Bangladesh, relations between the two countries have little or no chance of improving in the foreseeable future. However, right thinking Bangladeshi intellectuals rue the turn of events and see the disadvantages of an India-Bangladesh conflict to both countries. They are aware of the geographical location of Bangladesh which is surrounded on three sides by India and on one side by the Bay of Bengal. They also known that Bangladesh is heavily dependent on trade with India. It depends on India for river waters too. India too needs Bangladesh's cooperation to prevent Islamic militants and the North Eastern tribal militants from securing hideouts in Bangladesh to plan attacks on India. Friendship with Bangladesh is also needed to minimize the threat from China which is expanding its footprint in South Asia. Since the issues are deep and formal relations are cold, informal contacts (track-two diplomacy) could help heal the deep wounds inflicted by the cataclysmic events of this year and set the stage for a formal rapprochement. But since domestic political interests influence foreign relations, communal politics in Bangladesh and India will continue to vitiate bilateral relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd4-Qflw7hjL-OUGFZEdowZ	2024-11-29T21:35:14-08:00

Hezbollah Proclaims Tenuous Cease-Fire With Israel ‘Divine Victor...	(RFE/RL) — The leader of Hezbollah has claimed that its cease-fire deal with Israel is a 'divine victory' for the Lebanese political party and militant group. In his first address since the cease-fire took effect on November 27, Naim Qassem said on November 29 that the Iran-backed group had 'won because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah' and weakening the Lebanese 'resistance.' Hezbollah, which controls much of southern Lebanon and has representatives in parliament, is designated in its entirety by the U.S. as a terrorist organization but the EU has blacklisted only its military wing. The cease-fire ended nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel ramped up the pressure by launching a ground offensive in southern Lebanon in October and carrying out massive aerial bombardments of Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut and elsewhere. The truce ends the presence of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Israel, too, must withdraw its ground forces from Lebanon within 60 days of the deal going into force. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on November 26 warned Hezbollah that Israel would take action if it suspected that Hezbollah had violated the agreement. On November 29, hours before Qassem made his speech, Israel said it had struck a Hezbollah rocket launcher in southern Lebanon after detecting militant activity. The United States and France are overseeing the implementation of the truce, which includes provisions for thousands of Lebanese soldiers moving into southern Lebanon to work with UN peacekeepers and keep Hezbollah away from the Israeli border. Hezbollah had been launching rockets at northern Israel since the start of the Gaza war in October 2023. It said it would stop its attacks only after Israel ended its war in Gaza. Over the past 14 months, Israel killed nearly the entirety of Hezbollah's leadership, including Qassem's predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, and decimated the group's military arsenal. Israel has vowed to ensure Iran cannot continue to fund and arm the group, and has warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against facilitating Iranian aid for Hezbollah.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYXku3DGK1llN	2024-11-29T21:30:23-08:00	
China Tests Bilateral Waters With US Prisoner Exchange	By Qian Lang Three Americans who Washington says were wrongfully imprisoned in China have landed back on U.S. soil as part of a rare prisoner swap with Beijing, in a move analysts said could signal China’s willingness to do further deals with the incoming Trump administration. Mark Swidan, of Houston, Texas, Kai Li, of Long Island, New York, and John Leung, a permanent resident of Hong Kong, have been reunited with their families for the first time in years in time for Thanksgiving, Nov. 28 this year, ABC News reported. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke to Li, Leung and Swidan while they were en route back home. 'I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they’ll soon be reunited with their loved ones,' Blinken said via his X account. While the State Department didn’t reveal more details about the deal, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning confirmed that three Chinese citizens had also been returned. 'Three Chinese citizens who were wrongly detained by the United States have returned to their motherland safely,' Mao told a regular news conference in Beijing on Thursday. 'China has always firmly opposed the U.S.’s suppression and persecution of Chinese citizens for political purposes and will, as always, take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens,' she said. Accused of spying Reports named one of the Chinese nationals as Xu Yanjun, an official in the Chinese Ministry of State Security who became the first Chinese spy to be extradited to the United States following his arrest in Belgium in 2018. A jury found Xu guilty in 2021 of attempting to steal designs for an engine fan from Ohio-based GE Aviation. Department of Justice officials said it was part of an organized effort by Beijing to 'modernize' its own economy by stealing U.S. technology. Another was identified as Ji Chaojun, a former graduate student was sentenced in Chicago to eight years in prison for spying for China in January 2023, according to multiple media reports. Mao declined to identify the returned Chinese nationals, but said a 'fugitive' from Chinese justice had also been returned to the custody of the Chinese authorities, warning that the ruling Communist Party would 'continue to pursue fugitives ... to the end.' Sending a signal? Yang Haiying, a professor at Japan’s Shizuoka University, said such prisoner exchanges are rare for China, and could be intended to send a signal to the incoming Trump administration. 'Maybe China is trying to test Trump, whether he will want to do various kinds of deals with China in future,' Yang said, describing the swap as a form of 'hostage trading.' If that works, then maybe China and the United States can make bigger deals in future, including trade deals, political deals, and agreements on international issues like the South China Sea,' he said. 'I think they are sending that signal.' Current affairs commentator Guo Min said the swap was undoubtedly in Beijing’s interest at this time. 'China regards some of its people as so-called patriots for propaganda purposes, saying that the Chinese government has made great efforts to protect patriots and successfully returned them to China,' Guo said. 'Everything the Chinese government does is based on political considerations,' he said. The U.S. State Department on Wednesday downgraded its travel advisoryfor China from Level 3 (reconsider travel) to Level 2 (exercise extreme caution). The advisory now warns U.S. citizens of the possibility of 'arbitrary enforcement of local laws' in mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong, with the possibility of exit bans in mainland China.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYff6SFsl4cye	2024-11-29T21:21:15-08:00	
Jemaah Islamiyah’s Disbandment Appears Irreversible – And Real – ...	By Zachary Abuza At an event orchestrated by Indonesia’s counter-terrorism agency (BNPT) in late June, Abu Rusydan and 15 other senior Jemaah Islamiyah members read out a statement announcing that their militant group was disbanding. Many people, including victims of Jemaah Islamiyah’s past terrorist acts – foremost among them, the 2002 Bali bombings – reacted with suspicion. Abu Rusydan, Para Wijayanto, and JI military chief Khoirul Anam are all currently imprisoned, leading some to speculate whether this decision was coerced or done in the hopes of having their sentences reduced. Yet, evidence gathered in the months that followed suggests this decision was both real and irreversible. There are six reasons for this. First, although institutionally resilient, Jemaah Islamiyah had been militarily dormant since 2011 and weakened by arrests, including the December 2020 takedown of Zulkarnaen (also known as Aris Sumarsono), their head of military operations. His arrest decimated what was left of JI’s training apparatus. The government legally banned JI in 2008, but gave the group space to involve itself in education, charitable work, businesses and other activities, as long as it refrained from violence. Following Para Wijayanto’s 2019 arrest, attitudes towards Jemaah Islamiyah hardened among Indonesian security forces. They saw a well-resourced JI poised to resume violence after a tactical lull. That year, only 8% of total terrorism arrests were of JI members. As many JI suspects were arrested in 2021 and 2022 as were suspected members of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah. In 2023, suspected JI members accounted for 53% of terrorism arrests, including several next generation leaders, Wijayanto’s son amongst them. There was a political rationale as well. There are over 1,000 sharia codes throughout the country. Violence has achieved nothing towards implementing Islamic law, compared to democratic politics. Second, this was a deliberative process that was years in the making. Wijayanto approached Densus 88 following his 2019 arrest and requested a meeting with Abu Rusydan, a former emir of the group who was at large, but the police wouldn’t commit to not arresting him. Wijayanto had already penned a 500-page tract explaining his 42 reasons for disbanding the group. Even after Rusydan’s arrest in 2021, it still took nearly three years for the police to organize the meeting. But this past March, both men concluded that violent jihad was unnecessary because Muslims in Indonesia were not under attack, and the state itself was not holding back the establishment of the sharia. This built on a 2016 ruling by JI’s Fatwah Council that the national ideology, Pancasila, was not anti-Islamic in nature. The two leaders then requested a meeting with Khoirul Anam, who was also incarcerated, and Bambang Sukirno, a party elder and disciple of JI’s founder, Abdullah Sungkar. A video of that May meeting, with their decision to disband based on Rusydan’s 'Conclusion 642' theory, was then shared by Sukirno, who was not incarcerated, with other senior JI members. In a separate video, Koirul Anam announced that JI would immediately end 'tanzim siri' (clandestine organization) and 'tanzim askary' (military organization). That resulted in a gathering of the JI leadership in Solo, on June 29, with party elders and representatives of each of the 42 madrassas controlled by JI. The official disbandment announcement went forward the following day. Third, while deliberations unfolded, Abu Fatih started to build up trust by turning in weapons and explosive stocks, as a show of good faith. Fatih admitted that not all weapons had been turned in or located – unsurprising given the geographic spread of the organization and its cellular structure. A spokesman for Densus 88 acknowledged that while the process was still ongoing, 'The guns and explosives that they kept, including other materials that still reflect the strength of JI, were handed over.' Fourth, as of mid-November, many of the 5,500-6,000 members had attended one of the 42 ceremonies, where they pledged their allegiance to the 'Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia.' The size of the ceremonies has varied depending on the region, focusing on JI’s strongholds. The Java ceremonies have been the largest: Bekasi (400), Kudus (280), Semarang (230), Banyumas Raya (300), Karesidenan Pekalongan (152), Madiun (150), and in Depok. These ceremonies have been held across the archipelago, including in Central and South Sulawesi, Balikpapan, Palembang, Riau, the Malukus, and elsewhere in Sumatra. Almost all of these ceremonies have been attended by several of the 16 senior JI leaders, including Sukirino, Wijayanto, Abu Fatih, Abu Rusydan, Khoirul Anam, Zarkasih, Ustad Hasan Partono, and witnessed by Ustad Imtihan Syafi’i, the former chairman of the JI Fatwa Council and one of JI’s top Islamic law scholars. While not everyone is on board, there’s hope that more will be brought in as the decision and its justifications are disseminated more broadly. Fifth, there has been some initial progress in instituting curriculum reform at JI’s 42 madrassas and boarding schools. This will be the hardest piece, and will involve the constant supervision of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Religion, as well as the BNPT and Densus 88. The rejection of takfiri ideology and an acceptance of Islamic pluralism will be key to this. As important as curriculum reform, will be the commitment of the school leadership and the teachers, because the real radicalization and recruitment took place in after-school sessions. To date, the government has reported no pushback in their talks with the school leaders about curriculum reform. Sixth, Wijayanto opened up a channel to JI members still in Syria, who joined Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a militant group tied to al-Qaeda, to both share the announcement and to work with Densus 88 to bring them home. While not taking away from these positive developments there are reasons for continued concern. While JI leaders have apologized to victims and acknowledged that they went down the wrong path, the denouncement of violence has not been robust enough. One thing that is noticeable from the videos and photographs of the 42 ceremonies is just how old the members are. As such, many younger militants who are committed to using violence to achieve their political aims are likely to defect to other groups. With JAD decimated and leaderless, security forces have recently been focusing on Negara Islam Indonesia (NII), including making two more arrests in November 2024. We also don’t know the stance of prominent JI members who’ve recently been arrested or are currently on trial, including Farid Okbah, Fitria Sanjaya, Anung Al-Hamat, and Ahmad Zain An-Naja. But for now, the onus is on the state to better fund their disengagement programs and work with NGOs and other state actors to secure livelihoods. Thousands of former JI members have pledged allegiance to the Republic of Indonesia, and its 'unity in diversity.' Now, the question is, can the state deliver?

Israel Criticized For ‘Provocative Actions’ In Lebanon Despite Ce...	By Najia Houssari Israel was criticized on Friday for provocative actions in Lebanon, despite the ceasefire agreement currently in force. The Israeli military said Lebanese residents were prohibited from moving south to a line of villages and their surroundings until further notice. The army continued its operations in the border area it had advanced into and where it is still present, continuing actions which included uprooting olive trees, damaging structures, and even firing on mourners at a funeral. On the third day of the ceasefire, security reports — primarily from the Iran-backed Hezbollah — highlighted what were described as 'provocative Israeli violations.' The US general tasked with leading the ceasefire monitoring committee and its members began meetings in Beirut on Friday with the commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces Gen. Joseph Aoun to discuss the implementation of the agreement. Meanwhile, Al-Manar TV reported that Israeli forces 'advanced into the town square of Markaba … and began bulldozing operations and blocking roads.' The Israeli army also opened fire on residents in Khiam, who said that they had obtained permission from the Lebanese military, in coordination with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, to enter the town for a funeral. Footage captured by the mourners, who numbered no more than five or six, showed two of them injured in their legs by Israeli gunfire. The mourners said that they left a woman’s body on the ground after an artillery shell struck nearby. The incident forced them to flee. They also reported that the Israeli army seized the vehicles they had traveled in. Israelis fired machine guns toward Aitaroun and demolished a playground in Kfarkela. The army claimed on Thursday that the areas it had moved into in southern Lebanon were not included in the ceasefire agreement. The deal, which was approved by both Lebanon and Israel on Tuesday, went into effect on Wednesday morning. The Israeli army called on the Lebanese 'not to cross into a line of towns specified by name to enter the border area, extending from Shebaa through Habbariyeh, Arnoun, Yohmor, Qantara, Shaqra, Baraashit, Yater, and Mansouri,' as anyone crossing these towns would endanger themselves. The Israeli army said that it had 60 days to accomplish a 'complete withdrawal from these areas' under the agreement. The Israeli army has advanced into settlements extending 3 km from the border, an area which includes about 20 villages and Bint Jbeil. Israeli forces have also prohibited Lebanese residents in the restricted area from moving around between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. Eyewitnesses spoke of attacks on 'olive groves in Kfarkela, where bulldozers are uprooting olive trees near the Al-Abbara area.' Meanwhile, four Israeli tanks ventured into the western neighborhood of the town of Khiam. An artillery shell fell on the town and the Israeli army conducted occasional sweeping operations with machine guns. Israeli artillery shelling also targeted the outskirts of the towns of Markaba and Tallousa in the Marjayoun district while Israeli drones continued to fly over the western and central sectors. The Lebanese army, which continues to deploy in the areas south of the Litani River and away from the Israeli incursion, blocked the roads leading to the restricted area. Samir Geagea, head of the Lebanese Forces Party, said that 'Hezbollah’s war in support of Gaza destroyed both Gaza and Lebanon,' and criticized the 'unity of battlefields that Hezbollah called for.' He was speaking after a meeting held by the Lebanese Forces’ parliamentary bloc and executive body. Geagea added: 'Hezbollah usurped the Lebanese people by starting this war and took Lebanon to war while the majority of the people were against it. 'Hezbollah committed a great crime against the Lebanese people. We could have avoided the martyrdom of 4,000 people and all the displacement and destruction. '(But) despite all these disasters, Hezbollah MPs are still claiming victory, which is a strange and completely unrealistic logic.' Geagea said that the ceasefire approved by Hezbollah 'is the biggest proof of the illegitimacy of the party’s weapons,' and called on Hezbollah to 'meet with the army command and develop a plan to dismantle its military presence north of the Litani River. Meanwhile, the municipality of Mays Al-Jabal has warned residents returning to their town of the presence of 'landmines, explosives and unexploded shells.' It confirmed that it 'is following up with the Lebanese army and relevant authorities to facilitate the safe return of people on time.' The municipality warned that 'entering the town at present is dangerous as the enemy is firing and launching artillery shells into the town’s neighborhoods and streets to target any civilian movement in the area.' It added: 'Due to the presence of landmines, explosives, and unexploded shells in homes and neighborhoods, and given that some houses are still rigged with explosives and might detonate at any moment, as well as the town’s streets being blocked with rubble and obstacles, we urge you and rely on your awareness to refrain from heading to our town at this time, and await further instructions.' The Israeli army published a summary and data on Friday about the military operations carried out in the last two months against Hezbollah on the northern front. It added that 'orders preventing the return of residents to open areas north of Western Galilee and Upper Galilee remain in effect.' The Israeli army claimed that more than 12,500 targets were attacked, including more than 1,600 military headquarters and more than 1,000 ammunition depots. The Israeli operations included 'more than 14,000 flight hours for fighter jets and about 11,000 targets for attacks.' The army’s statement claimed that 'more than 1,500 offensive infrastructures, about 160 military headquarters, and about 150 ammunition depots were destroyed in the operation against the Radwan Force. 'About 2,500 high-ranking fighters were eliminated, causing significant damage to Hezbollah’s force.' The Israeli army added that it estimated that Hezbollah had less than 30 percent of the drones it had possessed on the eve of the conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYVpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-29T21:10:24-08:00	
Iran Refutes Allegation Of Violating Chemical Weapons Convention	Iran’s UN mission dismissed the accusation that Tehran has violated the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) by enhancing its chemical weapons capabilities. In a post on its X account on Thursday night, the permanent mission of Iran to the United Nations rejected the accusation that Tehran has contravened the Chemical Weapons Convention. 'A victim of Western-donated chemical weapons employed by the Saddam regime, Iran stands as a responsible member of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),' the mission said. 'Over the past several decades, not a single instance of Iranian violation has been recorded,' it added. 'The current unfounded reports are merely an outgrowth of psychological warfare propagated by the Zionist regime in the wake of its recent defeat on the Lebanese front,' the mission stated. It came after the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) cited a November 26 report by the Institute for Science and International Security, alleging that Iran has been focusing on how to produce and deliver pharmaceutical-based chemical agents (PBAs) for use in military attacks, using a variety of delivery systems, including drones.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYUAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-29T21:07:27-08:00	
Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s Speech At Legislative C...	President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan delivered a speech at the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis, emphasizing environmental protection and the green economy. Shavkat Mirziyoyev highlighted the importance of combating climate change and its devastating effects on the environment and public health. This speech takes on particular significance in the aftermath of COP 29. At the COP 29 Summit (Conference of Parties, which are the most important meetings on the international climate agenda), President Mirziyoyev called for global cooperation on climate change. On November 12, 2024, he described climate change as an urgent global threat, calling it a major driver of geopolitical tensions and a direct challenge to sustainable development. In his speeches, it is clear that the Uzbek president is aware of the severity of climate-related consequences. It is useful to emphasize the term 'consequences' because it is not climate change itself that poses a problem to humanity, but rather its dangerous impacts, such as desertification and drought. President Mirziyoyev stressed in his address to the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis that these consequences must be addressed by tackling the root cause: the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, which is the primary driver of global warming. The president also highlighted climate and environmental issues specific to Uzbekistan, such as the Aral Sea disaster, which occurred decades ago. He stated that his government has made the development of the green economy a national priority, supported by a program aimed at improving the ecological conditions in regions suffering from environmental degradation in Uzbekistan. Another key point in his speech was the importance of regional and international collaboration. He showcased a major initiative taken by Uzbekistan to launch a regional climate strategy, which includes the creation of the Central Asian University for Environmental Studies and Climate Change in the capital. According to various academic studies, such as that of Shukhrat & Zebo (2023), Uzbekistan plans to increase the share of green energy to 40% by 2030. This goal was confirmed by Energy Minister Zhurabek Mirzamakhmudov during the 'Russian Energy Week' forum (Ismailov, September 27, 2024). To achieve this, the Uzbek government is focusing on using efficient and energy-saving technologies in the design, reconstruction, and construction of buildings to enhance energy efficiency (reducing energy consumption per building) and renewable energy projects. Finally, a key message of the speech was President Mirziyoyev’s proposal to declare 2025 the 'Year of Environmental Protection and the Green Economy' in Uzbekistan. This proposal is well-founded, as he outlined the government’s plans, led by the newly elected Prime Minister, to develop a comprehensive state program addressing the major environmental challenges identified for the year. The program will prioritize implementing green technologies, responsible water resource management, significantly increasing green spaces, mitigating the consequences of the Aral Sea disaster, waste management, and, most importantly, improving public health. Once again, this conclusion is not without foundation. As academic studies show, such as Akhinjanovna’s (2023), the government has prioritized large-scale energy projects in recent years and made significant investments in green energy, including funding for photovoltaic solar power plants. For example, a project financed by the World Bank Group, Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC (Masdar), and the Uzbek government involves a 250-megawatt (MW) photovoltaic solar power plant with a 63 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) (IFC.org). In conclusion, the Uzbek government is prioritizing energy transition and investing at all levels (environmental protection, education, building insulation, transition to green energy, cooperation with neighbors, the EU, and internationally) to achieve its climate goals. It would be ideal for all countries to work together to combat global warming, which affects people around the world. BIBLIOGRAPHY Akhinjanovna, K. K. (2023).

Why Is Sidestepping Kazakhstan’s Constitution To Suit Minister, P...	In early November, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev paid a state visit to France at Emmanuel Macron's invitation. On this occasion, EURACTIV's Théo Bourgery-Gonse, in a piece entitled 'Kazakhstan president to visit France to talk all things nuclear' ('Le président du Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokaïev, attendu à Paris pour parler nucléaire'), quoted Catherine Poujol, a professor of History and Civilization of Central Asiaat French university Inalco (the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations) and director of the French Institute for Central Asian Studies from 2016 to 2020, as saying: 'There is a ‘Kazakhstan moment,’ which France has been quick to seize'. It's about one of those conventional journalistic accounts, which are usually made ahead of one of the visits by these or those leaders of the developing countries to Paris and to which few mainstream French media outlets and political experts normally pay attention. So, it hardly drew much attention and interest from the French reading public. And we of Kazakhstan, too, might pass by such piece, particularly since it appears to be written in a way that makes it like the publications in pro-government Kazakhstani media about Tokayev's activities domestically and in his country’s foreign relations, if not for its emphasis on the Kazakh President's linguistic talent and his allegedly caring attitude towards the state language of Kazakhstan. Because even the pro-regime Kazakhstani media do not often dare praise Mr.Tokayev in the context of the Kazakh language theme if they ever do. But first things first. The piece by Théo Bourgery-Gonse stated, 'Kazakhstan, finding itself on a thin line, is trying to walk a tightrope' between Russia, China, and the Europeans, eager to engage with all [of them], but wishing to avoid critical dependencies with each, explains Euractiv Catherine Poujol, a French historian and specialist in Central Asia at the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations (INALCO). Astana’s ties with China are also ‘excellent’, she adds. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who speaks perfect Mandarin, was even the first leader to welcome Xi Jinping in September 2022, after Chinese restrictions imposed in the context of COVID-19 had been lifted... Due to the geographical reality and the economic, cultural, and military ties that unite the two countries, 'Kazakhstan is beholden to Russia by nature, but [the president] wants to distance itself from it', emphasizes Catherine Poujol'. When in words, everything sounds good. But this is so only because Théo Bourgery-Gonse and his speaker, Catherine Poujol, a leading French expert on Kazakhstan, promote President Tokayev's image as a Kazakh patriotic-minded statesman and yet a shrewd diplomat and a polyglot who can perfectly speak his native language which, as implied, goes without saying, and also Mandarin, and a few other languages, and at the same time, it was as if they did not notice the fact that he carried out talks not only with Putin but also through interpreters, Xi Jinping, Emmanuel Macron, and other Western leaders just in Russian, but not in Kazakh. The last line in the piece by Théo Bourgery-Gonse is formulated as follows: 'Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's speech in Paris on Tuesday is expected to be symbolically read in Kazakh rather than Russian'. Such an approbation expressed in advance looks like an attempt to gloss over the above-cited fact. But reading seems to be the only thing Mr.Tokayev is capable of where there is а need to use his native and Kazakhstan’s state language. He can also say a few basic welcoming or opening phrases in Kazakh without reading from a piece of paper. Yet the truth is, Kazakhstan’s President Kasym-Jomart Tokayev hasn’t given a single press conference in Kazakh for over 5 years of his being in office and has never been seen speaking at length the state language while talking with his co-citizens in public. He usually favors Russian and, as stated in the above piece by Théo Bourgery-Gonse, 'speaks perfect Mandarin', though knowledge of these languages, unlike Kazakh, is not binding on the one who is in office in Akorda (the residence of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan). Hence, the fact of being a Russian and Chinese speaker does not excuse Mr.Tokayev, as Kazakh President, from the constitutional obligation to be fluent in Kazakh. That may be so according to the mere letter of the law, but in fact, it doesn't look to be. Below's what's happening in real life. How Was Berik Uali Trying To Justify The Fact That Mr.Tokayev Had Not Given An Interview In His State Language? Shortly after the 2022 protest events, now known in Kazakhstan as 'Bloody January', in late January 2022, Kassym-Jomart gave a 50-minute television exclusive interview to Vera Zakharchuk, an ethnic Russian journalist. Such a solution was felt as an oddity. Even more strange appeared the first televised interview given in Russian by the Kazakh president to an ethnic Russian journalist following the January 2022 unrest in Kazakhstan, if one considers the fact that those mass protest rallies involved only ethnic Kazakh people, in particular the Kazakh-speaking youth who had come to the cities from rural areas in search of work and earnings. Here is the comment by Catherine, an ethnic Russian woman who lives near the central square of Almaty (that is, just off the city hall), where the worst of the unrest took place, on the situation in those days: 'As for the very protests, only Kazakhs participate in them. There are no Russians among them'. Before these people, Kazakh President Tokayev spoke in Russian and through the mediation of an ethnic Russian journalist in the wake of the January 2022 unrest. This got the Kazakh-speaking audience wondering why he had made that choice. His press secretary, Berik Uali, had to stand out and speak in explanation of why a choice in favor of the Russian language had been made. He claimed that the global viewers had been meant to be the main audience of that interview. The implication was that the Russian language is recognized and spread throughout the world, unlike Kazakh. Such an explanation only fueled more questions. Dos Koshim, a Kazakh political analyst, said: 'An interesting response. Does this mean that the world community has switched to Russian[?]… Well, one cannot cast aspersions on the entire world community trying to justify the fact that our president did not give an interview in his state language'. It was then announced that Tokayev would soon give a television interview in Kazakh. On February 17, Kazakhstan TV broadcasted an interviewwith President Tokayev in Kazakh. Here is how it was commented on in a video material entitled 'The question is whether Tokayev wasn't 'reading' his interview?' by Radio Azattyk's Nurgul Tapayeva and Yerzhan Amirkhanov: 'Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has given his first ever Kazakh-language interview since taking office. The interview mostly focused on the [2022] January events. However, some viewers are questioning the authenticity of the questions and answers. The [text of the] interview held at the Akorda residence was written in advance. After watching it, the audience began to speculate that the President read the answers to the journalist's questions from a screen like this one [Radio Azattyk's Nurgul Tapayeva points at a rather small monitor]. Journalists call it a teleprompter… Radio Azattyk asked the journalist of the Kazakhstan TV channel, Zhaina Slambek, who had conducted the interview, whether the questions were or were not in advance sent to the President. The journalist refused to answer'. The latter's status as a journalist enables her not to disclose the terms on which she has been granted consent to the interviews. Is There Another Such High-Ranking Official In The World Who Is Not Fluent In His Country's State Language? It's quite a different thing when it comes to the press secretary of the Kazakh President, Berik Uali, who preliminarily announced this very interview of Tokayev in the Kazakh language and most probably, in one way or another, participated in organizing and arranging it. By the way, on February 14, 2022, three days before the interview by his chief, President Tokayev, was due to be aired on the Kazakhstan TV channel, he was elected as that TV company's chairman of the board of directors. That is, at the moment of that interview's airing, Berik Uali simultaneously represented Kazakhstan's President's Staff and the Kazakhstan TV channel. But, be that as it may, he was a public officer at that time. And his oath of office, with the words, 'I solemnly swear to uphold the country's Constitution and laws', requires him not to allow any action or inaction that may be perceived as deviating from the constitutional model and the constitutional norms. Paragraph 2 in Article 41 of the present Constitution of Kazakhstan states that not only the incumbent President but any Kazakhstani citizen who wants to try to run for presidential office must be 'fluent in the state language', which means that Mr.Tokayev needs, first of all, to speak Kazakh fluently and not just to read it. So, even now, it is not too late for the Kazakh journalists to ask Berik Uali, who is still Mr.Tokayev's press secretary, whether there was any basis for speculations that 'the president read the [prewritten] answers to the journalist's questions from a screen' during 'his first ever Kazakh-language interview since taking office'. Should he fully refute such speculations and assure them that the incumbent Kazakh Kazakh President speaks fluently the state language of Kazakhstan, he will immediately have to face the need to arrange and hold a press conference with the participation of Mr.Tokayev. Otherwise, his assurances will remain words. As it here is a question of a constitutional matter, he, as a state official, is supposed not to make any statement that may be perceived as deviating from the constitutional model and the constitutional norms. Yet, the question of the Kazakh President publicly proving his state language proficiency at the level of the requirements of Kazakhstan's Constitution has long been on the agenda. It has become particularly pertinent following Mr.Tokayev's first-ever Kazakh-language interview, and it still is. Ethnic Kazakhs, who make up more than 70 percent of Kazakhstan's population, want their president to be able to speak Kazakh in public without reading from a piece of paper. The requests from the public then sounded appropriate and regular: the incumbent Kazakh President should give a live interview on Kazakhstan television or, better yet, give a multi-hour press conference to domestic and foreign journalists in the same way as Russian President Putin and Belorussian President Lukashenko usually do. But none of these was ever done. Hence, the conclusion is begged that, contrary to the requirement of Paragraph 2 in Article 41 of the present Constitution of Kazakhstan, the incumbent Kazakh President is not 'fluent in the state language'. That is, his Kazakh, to be polite, leaves much to be desired. To judge this by actual observation, with his knowledge of the state language of Kazakhstan, he may probably be compared with a first-year student learning some foreign language. It turns out that he can read Kazakh but cannot lead a spontaneous and fluent conversation with the audience in his nation's state language. Not only that, he began promoting people without sufficient knowledge of the State language to ministerial posts. Here is just one example of how this is being done. On April 11, 2023, Lenta.ru, in a piece entitled ‘In Kazakhstan, Russian-speaking minister is being compelled to learn Kazakh’, reported: 'On April 6, [Almassadam] Satkaliyev [who had been appointed the new Minister of Energy of Kazakhstan just two days earlier] was presenting the bill ‘On Heat Power Engineering’ to the members of the Majilis [lower chamber of the Parliament of Kazakhstan]. MP Bakytzhan Bazarbek remarked that the minister had to speak the official state language of Kazakhstan. 'If you cannot speak Kazakh, you must have an [Kazakh-speaking] assistant', he said'. What Is The Difference Between Russian Coach Cherchesov And Kazakh Minister Satkaliyev? After the remark by the MP, the head of the Energy Ministry was not at a loss and promised to learn the Kazakh language in 6 months [i.e. by October 6, 2023]. For more than a quarter of a century, Almassadam Satkaliyev had been working for state companies and in the civil service. In the fifty-third year of his age, he promised to engage seriously in learning the official State language of Kazakhstan. Now, when it has been not just 6 months but a year and a half since then, let's see what has come out of Mr.Satkaliyev’s pledge to make himself fluent in Kazakh for half a year. Ulysmedia.kz, in a report entitled 'Arrogance or unprofessionalism? The Energy Minister refused to answer a journalist in Kazakh' and published on November 25, said: 'A Ulysmedia journalist asked the Minister to comment on the situation in Zhanaozen, where workers have been on strike for more than 10 days. It should be noted that all residents of Zhanaozen speak mainly Kazakh. Therefore, the official was asked to answer in Kazakh, as well, so that the striking workers could listen to the Minister's answer without misunderstanding. In a dismissive tone, the Minister declined to answer the question posed in the state language. The behavior of the head of the Ministry of Energy surprised the media representatives present. It must be said that Satkaliyev has been holding the post of minister for 1.5 years already, and in that time, he still apparently has not learned Kazakh'. Honestly, in conformity with his country's Constitution and laws, he was supposed to have already been fluent in Kazakh at the time of his nomination to his current post, as, according to Article 7 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan, 'the state language of the Republic of Kazakhstan shall be the Kazakh language'. As for his refusal to answer the question posed in the state language, according to Article 7 of the Law 'On Languages in the Republic of Kazakhstan', 'actions of officials that impede the functioning of ... the state language... entail liability under the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan'. Yet this actually seems not to be working in the case under consideration. Otherwise, what else could be the explanation for what a Ulysmedia journalist saw? How could one be a member of the Cabinet of Ministers in a country without being fluent in its state language and, at the same time, showing disregard for it? The matter probably would become clearer only when one compares the above case with what had earlier happened with Stanislav Cherchesov. The latter, too, encountered a question in Kazakh at a news conference. But he didn't refuse to answer. Instead, he tried to laugh off the awkward situation. This story caused a great resonance in the local and international media. Cherchesov was fined 738,400 tenges ($1,500) and underwent counseling about the importance of respecting the state language. In a similar situation, Kazakh Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev 'dismissively declined to answer the question posed in the state language'. This story did not cause excitement among the local media. And nobody seems to have noticed it outside Kazakhstan. Thus, in the context of critical assessments of the state language's unenviable situation in Kazakhstan, the elites who run the country find themselves untouchable by default. So, why Is sidestepping Kazakhstan's Constitution to suit the minister and the President not a reason for Sasha Baron Cohen to call it Borat country?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYTSrnr1-fvTf	2024-11-29T20:56:51-08:00	
Eni: Agreement In Côte d’Ivoire To Protect And Restore 14 Forests...	Eni signed Friday an agreement with the Côte d'Ivoire's Ministry of Water and Forests to launch a project to preserve and restore forest areas in the country. The initiative, which follows the feasibility study launched in September 2022 with the participation of local stakeholders, will cover 14 forests, identified in close cooperation with the competent authorities, over an area of 155,000 hectares, in the Lagunes and Comoé regions, located respectively in the south and south-east of the country. The agreement focuses on two areas of intervention. The first aims to conserve the remaining existing forest heritage and biodiversity by strengthening the control measures already in place to prevent the risk of deforestation, fires and poaching, and it is based on an extensive awareness-raising and training programme involving local communities and relevant institutions. The second foresees the restoration of some 130,000 hectares of forest area through the planting of some 12 million trees of local species in abandoned and degraded areas, accompanied by agro-forestry initiatives to promote more sustainable farming practices and improve the productivity of cultivated land for the benefit of local farming communities. The project, defined in partnership with the Ivorian authorities, is in line with the country's National Development Plans and the Ivorian strategy to reduce deforestation and related emissions, including by leveraging forest area restoration. It also aligns with Eni's decarbonisation plan, contributing to the achievement of zero net upstream emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in the Baleine development.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYfFjyohAmdc3	2024-11-29T20:54:10-08:00	
Turkey’s Natural Gas Dependency On Gazprom And US Sanctions: Poss...	Following the US sanctions on Gazprombank, Turkey's request for an exemption from these sanctions to continue importing natural gas from Russia has brought energy dependency issues back into focus. The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources' request reflects Turkey's efforts to safeguard energy supply security while also highlighting gaps in its energy independence. Gazprom's Share in Turkey's Energy Market Gazprom, which accounts for 40% of Turkey's natural gas imports, has been targeted by US sanctions. The US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Gazprom and six foreign subsidiaries, prompting Turkey to seek diplomatic solutions to avoid disruptions. Meanwhile, some European Union member states continue to import gas from Russia, raising questions about Turkey's position in the face of these sanctions. According to data from Turkey's Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK), the country's natural gas consumption for 2024 is expected to fall below the projected 56 billion cubic meters. However, this situation underscores the need to ensure energy supply security and intensify efforts to diversify energy sources. Dependency in Energy Policies and Alternatives Requesting exemptions from the US exposes Turkey's reliance on external energy sources. To reduce dependency and enhance energy independence, the following steps can be considered: 1. Alternative Suppliers: Increasing LNG imports from countries like Qatar and Algeria could diversify energy sources. 2. Renewable Energy: Investments in wind, solar, and hydroelectric energy should be accelerated. 3. Domestic Resources: Newly discovered natural gas reserves in the Black Sea and Mediterranean should be rapidly brought into production. 4. Increasing Storage Capacity: Expanding natural gas storage capacity can strengthen supply security. Reducing reliance on Russia has become a strategic priority for Turkey's energy independence. US sanctions serve as a warning to address this dependency. Investments in renewable energy and diversification of suppliers will play a critical role in ensuring energy security. In the short term, however, diplomatic efforts will be necessary to prevent interruptions in energy imports.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYaL4tGz8p_DK	2024-11-29T20:49:45-08:00	
Winter Blackouts In Kashmir: A Crisis Of Power And Productivity –...	Kashmir and other locations amply indicate that energy may be utilized in the same way as a weapon to manipulate people’s activities. Interrupted electricity supply, especially in winter, has significant impacts on people’s everyday activities in Occupied Kashmir; the students’ studies are disrupted as well as the industrial sector, where both employers and employees are tested. These power outages might be considered a constructive approach by which the state can control and put pressure on the people with an aim of altering their attitudes and habits. The availability of reliable power services limits productivity as well as increases the already very high living standards; therefore, discontent and greater unrest among the population. These strategic tactics of energy expose more of the worldwide politics and power supply management in the conflict zones. Winter is the time of numerous problems in Kashmir. Life is made very hard because of power outages. Blackouts disturb daily life and economic activities. Families cannot get electricity, and students cannot study. The industrial sector also suffers as machines stop working. It is a major cause of worry for everyone because power supply is unreliable and leaves people in the dark for long periods. More power cuts further worsen the problems that accompany winter, and life becomes worse for people of Kashmir. According to Kashmir Power development cooperation Limited (KPDCL) officials, power demand in the Valley has risen to 2200 MW, whereas the supply remains at only 1500 MW. This is leaving Kashmiris deprived of this crucial life resource since electricity being produced in Jammu and Kashmir is being supplied elsewhere. The situation with power outages increases the problems that small and medium enterprises, already grappling with economic challenges, have to face during the limited daylight hours of winter. Daily life is constantly disrupted, and the progress of economic activities is obstructed, while the entire populace of Kashmir faces difficulties with added intensity, which has heightened the urgent need for better resource distribution. Despite significant infrastructure investment and the installation of smart meters, power cuts remain commonplace in Kashmir, leading to growing dissatisfaction and frustration among its residents. The people of Kashmir are increasingly questioning why these enormous investments in the energy sector are unable to deliver constant, uninterrupted electricity as promised. The Indian government has been systematically involved in denying basic rights that would help ensure the dignified lives of Kashmiris. One of the collective punishments is the denial of electricity to Kashmiris when the severest winter comes sucking the resources and hydroelectric potential of the region, further increasing people's hardship. It reminds people of never-ending fights for basic needs. The electricity shortage has strangulated the economy in Kashmir, badly affecting business and daily life. In such a situation, heavy bills are burdening Kashmiris, an unequal treatment that increases their hardships further. Power demand in the Valley has increased to 2200 MW, whereas supply is only up to 1500 MW. This creates a contradiction with India's statement that all is well in the Valley and that peace and development are on the move there. The constant power cuts disturb economic activities, hinder students' education, and challenge the industrial sector. India's denial of reliable electricity to Kashmiris during harsh winters, while exploiting the region's resources, is a form of collective punishment that highlights the continued oppression and marginalization of the Kashmiri people. The United Nations (UN) and other international actors must force India to end state-sponsored miseries of the Kashmiris and fulfill its international obligations for a just and rightful resolution of the Kashmir issue as mentioned in the UN resolution of self-determination. A fair and impartial referendum is needed so that the people of Kashmir can determine their future. This constant subjugation and denial of elementary rights in Kashmir is weakening Indian claims about democracy and justice. Of course, it is essential that international opinion takes substantive measures to coax peace, stability, and the protection of human rights in the area.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLberM2PaZovz2oFCvJ_OI	2024-11-29T20:42:34-08:00	
A Planet On The Brink: The Imperative For Comprehensive Climate A...	Climate change is no longer a distant threat but an immediate, multidimensional crisis challenging ecological, economic, and social stability across the globe. The indicators are unambiguous: rising sea levels, melting ice caps, and intensifying weather extremes underscore the stark reality that our climate is in a state of rapid transformation. Global in scope yet acutely local in impact, climate change threatens to reshape economies, strain public health, and destabilize entire communities. As global temperatures rise, exacerbating climate-related catastrophes, the pressing question is no longer whether to act, but how swiftly and effectively humanity can marshal resources and mobilize innovative solutions to avert potentially irreversible damage. The Unrelenting Pace of Climate Change: A Clear, Quantifiable Threat Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveals that the global average surface temperature has risen by 1.1°C since the late 19th century, a seemingly small change with monumental implications. The year 2023 was one of the hottest on record, with multiple temperature extremes pushing global averages dangerously close to the 1.5°C threshold—a limit scientists emphasize is critical to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Already, warming oceans have expanded by approximately 0.12 inches per year since 1993 due to thermal expansion, causing sea levels to rise. In 2022 alone, the Greenland ice sheet lost around 286 billion metric tons of ice, enough to cover the entire state of California in four feet of water. In economic terms, the impact is staggering. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, climate-related disasters in 2023 cost the global economy over $300 billion, with damages projected to reach as much as $2 trillion annually by 2050 if no substantial mitigation efforts are undertaken. Climate change is poised to disrupt not only economies but also labor markets: a 2019 report by the International Labour Organization projected that rising heat levels could result in a 2.2% reduction in global working hours by 2030, equivalent to a loss of 80 million full-time jobs and $2.4 trillion in global economic losses. Human Cost and Climate Injustice: The Disproportionate Burden on Vulnerable Communities The social cost of climate change often falls hardest on communities with the least capacity to adapt. Vulnerable regions are not only more susceptible to extreme weather events, but they also face significant structural challenges in recovering from them. In 2022, the Pakistani floods—described by the World Bank as 'biblical in scale'—displaced over 33 million people, leaving large swathes of agricultural land unfit for cultivation and pushing the country’s economy to the brink of collapse. In the same year, Sub-Saharan Africa experienced its worst drought in four decades, leaving 36 million people across the Horn of Africa in immediate need of humanitarian assistance. This climate-induced suffering underscores a glaring injustice: those least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions are bearing the brunt of climate impacts. Although Africa accounts for less than 4% of global emissions, over 100 million Africans could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate shocks, according to the African Development Bank. The burden also falls disproportionately along gender lines. Studies from the United Nations show that women—especially in rural regions—are 14 times more likely to die during climate-induced disasters than men. Their roles in water collection and agricultural labor, particularly in low-income regions, expose them to the direct impacts of climate-induced resource scarcity and make them especially vulnerable to displacement. The Consequences of Inaction: Climate Migration and Global Security Risks The climate crisis is projected to trigger unprecedented levels of human migration. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, climate change could force 216 million people across six global regions to migrate within their countries. This climate-driven migration is not just a humanitarian issue; it has profound implications for global security, as regions under stress from climate impacts may become hotspots of political instability. For instance, the 2023 Pacific typhoon season, intensified by climate change, displaced thousands across Southeast Asia, sparking tensions over land and resources. Environmental migration is likely to strain international systems and exacerbate existing conflicts. Climate-related water scarcity, predicted to impact up to 1.8 billion people by 2025, has the potential to ignite transboundary disputes, particularly in regions with historically contentious water sources, such as the Nile Basin, the Jordan River, and the Tigris-Euphrates. In recognizing the intersection of climate and security, the United Nations Security Council recently highlighted climate change as a 'threat multiplier' in conflict zones, particularly in regions like the Sahel, where resource scarcity fuels armed conflict and extremist activities. Advances in Technology: A Pathway to Climate Mitigation Despite the overwhelming data underscoring the gravity of the climate crisis, emerging technologies provide a pathway to mitigate its impacts. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are becoming economically viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Solar energy costs, for example, have dropped by 89% since 2010, making it more affordable than coal in many parts of the world. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewable energy could account for up to 86% of the global energy mix by 2050 if current investment trends continue, with the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 70%. Moreover, innovative approaches to carbon management are gaining traction. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, while costly, has the potential to capture up to 90% of carbon emissions from industrial facilities and power plants. Breakthroughs in this area, such as the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates $369 billion toward climate and energy policies, are incentivizing further development of CCS and other green technologies. Yet, rapid scaling is essential to make a measurable difference. Investment in electric vehicles (EVs) and the electrification of transportation systems is also crucial. The transportation sector alone contributes to approximately 14% of global carbon emissions. However, recent advances in battery technology and government incentives have contributed to a 54% increase in EV sales in 2023. Leading economies such as China and the EU have set ambitious targets to phase out combustion-engine vehicles by 2035, highlighting a shift toward electrified transportation that, if implemented globally, could cut transportation emissions in half by mid-century. International Cooperation and Policy Commitment: A Pivotal Role for Political Will Although technological advancements are promising, they must be matched by strong policy commitments and international cooperation. Initiatives such as the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming to below 2°C, yet countries are currently not on track to meet these targets. The 2023 Global Carbon Budget report highlighted that current policy trajectories could lead to a 2.7°C increase by the end of the century—a catastrophic outcome. One of the most promising yet challenging aspects of international cooperation lies in establishing a 'loss and damage' fund, compelling wealthier nations to compensate those hardest-hit by climate impacts. The 2023 UN climate conference (COP28) took a step toward institutionalizing this fund, though its effectiveness will depend on binding commitments and timely disbursements. If adequately implemented, the fund could provide much-needed financial support for countries facing the immediate impacts of climate change, such as rebuilding infrastructure and investing in climate adaptation. Individual and Collective Action: Building a Resilient Society While systemic change is essential, individual and community-level actions remain significant. Studies by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions show that if every household reduced its energy consumption by 10%, the United States could avoid releasing over 60 million tons of CO2 annually. Grassroots movements, from youth-led environmental advocacy to local conservation efforts, play an instrumental role in demanding policy shifts and raising awareness. Education is also a crucial component of climate resilience. By integrating climate education into school curricula, society can prepare a generation to understand, mitigate, and adapt to climate challenges. A well-informed public will not only support sustainable policies but will also engage in behaviors that reflect a deeper commitment to environmental stewardship. A Call for a Paradigm Shift: Reshaping Humanity’s Relationship with Nature The climate crisis represents not only a technical challenge but a moral imperative that calls for a profound shift in humanity's relationship with nature. Addressing climate change requires that we transcend the traditional boundaries of nations, sectors, and industries to form a unified global response. For those of us with the privilege of education, resources, and influence, there is an ethical duty to advocate for policies that prioritize the long-term health of our planet over short-term economic gains. As global citizens, we must recognize that the choices we make today will define the world for future generations. We are at a pivotal moment where action—or inaction—will determine the resilience of ecosystems, the stability of economies, and the survival of communities worldwide. In the words of environmentalist David Attenborough, 'The future of humanity and indeed all life on Earth now depends on us.' The time to act is now.

Outer Space Weaponization and Potential Gaps within PAROS – OpEd	The growing militarization of outer space reflects a shift from its earlier perception as a protected, peaceful domain to an arena where nations are actively advancing their strategic and military capabilities. What was once considered a neutral space reserved for exploration and scientific endeavors is now a key frontier in national defense, with various countries developing satellite-based weapons, anti-satellite (ASAT) systems, and other technologies aimed at asserting dominance and protecting their interests in orbit. Yet, the debate on which PAROS stands does not address contemporary issues of space weaponization, leaving gaps in debate regarding the rapid development of ASAT capabilities and other weaponized technologies. This transformation highlights the increasing strategic importance of space, where geopolitical rivalries are extending beyond Earth's atmosphere. Key treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1979 Moon Agreement are central to the legal debate. Article III of the OST mandates that space activities comply with international law and the UN Charter, emphasizing peaceful usage. Article IV is nuanced: it bans weapons of mass destruction in orbit but allows for military use, stopping short of comprehensive demilitarization. Specifically, Article IV (2) enforces a strict prohibition on military activities on the Moon and other celestial bodies, underscoring their exclusive peaceful use. The Moon Agreement reiterates this, banning any hostile acts on the Moon. Overall, while the OST sets some boundaries on space weaponization, the current regulatory environment remains permissive, providing ample scope for military activities and development. This leeway, coupled with emerging security threats like cyberattacks and the deployment of space-specific military assets, suggests a gap in international law as it pertains to evolving security dynamics in space. Despite these frameworks, current space laws permit extensive military activities. Conventional weapons and intelligence-gathering are permissible, while recent actions—such as ASAT (anti-satellite) tests conducted by China, the U.S., and India—illustrate the trend of increased militarized maneuvers. India, for instance, demonstrated its ASAT capabilities on 27 March 2019 through 'Mission Shakti,' successfully striking a satellite in low Earth orbit with a kinetic kill vehicle. The test created hundreds of pieces of debris in low Earth orbit, increasing the risk of collisions with other satellites and space missions. This debris can persist for years, heightening the potential for incidents that could damage crucial space infrastructure and disrupt global services such as communications, navigation, and weather forecasting. Such actions contribute to an arms race in space, shifting the focus from peaceful exploration to conflict preparedness Additionally, nations like the U.S. and France have established dedicated military space forces, underscoring a commitment to space defense. These forces, such as the U.S. Space Force, have developed capabilities like satellite jamming to prevent enemy access to satellite communications, and strategies emphasize the need for military superiority and defense in space. Gul Qaiser Sarwani, a Pakistani delegate to the UN, warns that any conflict originating from outer space could have far-reaching effects beyond space itself, impacting all aspects of life on Earth—even in countries without space capabilities. He emphasizes the lack of progress in international negotiations to prevent an arms race in space (PAROS), despite the goals set by the Outer Space Treaty of the 1960s. Sarwani notes that divisions among countries on how to secure space have widened, with conflicting approaches and competitive agendas complicating efforts. To address these challenges, Pakistan advocates for a 'holistic approach' to space security, calling for actions that address dual-use technologies (those with both civilian and military applications) and explicitly warfighting-oriented space capabilities. Sarwani reinforces Pakistan’s long-standing support for a legally binding treaty on PAROS and its contributions to non-binding initiatives like Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs). Historically, such measures have often paved the way for binding agreements, and Pakistan believes they hold similar potential for space security. An updated PAROS, aligned with current realities, could play a critical role in reducing and managing the growing array of space-based threats that pose risks to global stability. Unlike in the past, where space was predominantly a domain of exploration and scientific advancement, the modern space environment faced issues stemming from weaponization, militarization, and dual-use technologies. There needs to be a PAROS agreement that would address these threats by establishing clearer limitations on military activities in space, providing frameworks for transparency in ASAT weapon development, and setting international norms against the deployment of destabilizing technologies, including those that could interfere with satellite communications or navigation systems. To move PAROS beyond the decades of stalled negotiations within the UN Conference on Disarmament (CD), there is an urgent need for a robust debate on establishing a legally binding treaty and regulatory regime that aligns with international law. While the CD has been instrumental in bringing attention to the risks of an arms race in space, its limitations in producing actionable outcomes have prevented PAROS from adapting to contemporary challenges. By shifting the focus to a treaty-based approach, member states could work toward creating enforceable legal mechanisms that prevent space weaponization, prohibit offensive uses of space assets, and ensure transparency in the development of space technologies with dual-use potential.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5ApyW97guT9A	2024-11-29T20:32:03-08:00	
The Fallout Of July Jailbreak And Looming Civil War In Bangladesh...	Bangladesh, a nation lauded for its steady economic growth and social advancements, finds itself at a critical crossroads. The July uprising has ushered the country towards new hope to build a discrimination free society. But, on July 19, a meticulously orchestrated jailbreak saw over 2,241 inmates, including 88 on death row, escape from prisons across the country, including the high-security facility. Among the escapees were militants affiliated with extremist groups such as Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT). This brazen act, which also resulted in the looting of weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition, has plunged the nation into an unprecedented security crisis. The jailbreak is emblematic of a broader set of challenges threatening not just Bangladesh's internal stability but also the regional equilibrium in South Asia. India's growing concerns about militant spillovers and its hints at taking harsher measures underscore the gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, the potential for punitive international actions, particularly from the United States under the influence of Donald Trump's strategic priorities, adds further complexity. The events of July 19 marked a watershed moment in Bangladesh's recent history. The escape of over 826 prisoners, including nine militants, was part of a broader coordinated attack that targeted not only prison facilities but also over 400 police stations across the country. These attacks were meticulously planned, resulting in the theft of hundreds of weapons, bullet-proof jackets, and other critical supplies. The jailbreak revealed deep vulnerabilities in Bangladesh's law enforcement and prison management systems. The militants, already known for their operational sophistication, capitalized on these weaknesses to secure their freedom. With this newfound liberty, they have become a significant threat to national security, capable of launching devastating attacks and undermining public confidence in the state's ability to protect its citizens. The aftermath of the jailbreak has introduced a new era of uncertainty for Bangladesh. The escapees, particularly the militants and top criminals, are now a looming threat to the country's national security. Their likely targets include minority communities such as Hindus and organizations like ISKCON, which have historically been vulnerable to extremist violence. This raises fears of communal unrest, which could spiral into a larger conflict. The regional implications of this instability are equally alarming. Given Bangladesh's proximity to India, the risk of cross-border militant activities has heightened tensions between the two neighbors. India's increasing vigilance reflects its apprehension about the potential for spillover effects. Furthermore, the resurgence of terrorism in Bangladesh could destabilize the entire region, complicating efforts to maintain peace and security in South Asia. The effort to destabilize Bangladesh appears to be driven by a complex interplay of motives, encompassing both individual and ideological objectives. For many of the escapees, creating chaos serves as a strategy to avoid rearrest. By fostering an environment of anarchy, they divert law enforcement resources and attention, making it harder for the authorities to track them down. Ideologically, extremist groups see instability as an opportunity to propagate their radical agendas. In a nation grappling with disorder, they can recruit followers, train militants, and expand their operations with relative ease. For criminal gangs, instability is a means of survival. In the absence of effective law enforcement, these groups can continue their illegal activities, from drug trafficking to extortion, without fear of consequences. Moreover, political and social upheaval provides a fertile ground for extremism, threatening to turn Bangladesh into a hotbed of radical activity with far-reaching implications. Unfortunately, these all are now a common day to day issues in Bangladesh. In the face of these mounting challenges, the role of Bangladesh's patriotic armed forces is crucial. As protectors of the nation's sovereignty, they must act decisively to restore order and prevent further deterioration of the security situation. Securing the country's borders is a vital first step to prevent the escapees from fleeing into neighboring countries and to stop any cross-border movement of militants. Within the country, the armed forces need to collaborate closely with law enforcement agencies to launch targeted operations aimed at capturing the fugitives and dismantling their networks. Protecting vulnerable communities is another essential task. Militants often target minorities and religious organizations to incite fear and chaos, and the armed forces must take proactive measures to safeguard these groups. In the event of prolonged political instability, the military may also need to step in as a stabilizing force. It has become evident that the interim government led by Yunus was unable to effectively manage the prevailing circumstances. In such a scenario, it may be essential for the Bangladesh Armed Forces to intervene decisively in state affairs to prevent the nation from descending further into chaos and anarchy. On the international front, Donald Trump's strategy toward Bangladesh could significantly influence the country's future. Known for his hardline policies, Trump may consider imposing punitive tariffs on Bangladesh's exports, particularly in the lucrative textile sector, as a response to the ongoing atrocities towards minorities. Such measures would severely impact the nation's economy, which is already under strain. Additionally, Trump could target key figures in Bangladesh's interim government, including members of the civil-military administration, with sanctions. These punitive actions would further isolate Bangladesh on the global stage, complicating its efforts to restore stability. However, Trump's administration may also extend conditional support to Bangladesh if the armed forces take decisive steps to combat militancy and restore order. This support would likely be contingent on aligning with U.S. interests in countering extremism and maintaining regional stability. Bangladesh stands at a perilous juncture, grappling with an unprecedented security crisis in the aftermath of the July 19 jailbreak. The escape of over 2,241 inmates, including militants and top criminals, has exposed deep vulnerabilities in the nation's security apparatus and highlighted the urgent need for action. The stakes are high, and the consequences of inaction could be catastrophic. Only through the decisive and patriotic intervention of the Armed Forces can Bangladesh hope to navigate this crisis and emerge stronger on the other side.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5CBMFh7WUnkK	2024-11-29T20:22:37-08:00	
Pakistan Refinery Takeaways From Analyst Briefing	Pakistan Refinery (PRL) held its corporate briefing session on Friday to discuss FY24 financial results and provide insights on the future outlook. Key takeaways are as follows: Company posted topline of PKR306 billion in FY24 as compared to PKR262 billion in FY23, up 17%YoY, led by volumetric growth. Earnings for the year came to PKR4.1 billion (EPS: PKR6.45) as compared to PKR1.8 billion (EPS: PKR2.90) for the same period last year. Total HSD production for the year was reported at 660,180 tons, with the highest average daily production recorded at 2,013 tons. MS-92 also saw growth in output, with an annual production of 265,710 tons and a peak average daily production of 830 tons. MS-95 production totaled 16,005 tons, of which 1,940 tons were EURO-V compliant. Management stated, that crude intake is continuously adjusted to optimize yields and select crudes that better align with the refinery's configuration. Throughout FY24, Aramco crude intake remained the highest. Management also focused on reducing furnace oil output in the production mix, while increasing the share of High Speed Diesel and Motor Spirit (MS), as margins for furnace oil are unfavorable. Refinery Expansion and Upgradation Project (REUP) aims to achieve: 1) production of EURO V compliant HSD and MS/ Petrol, 2) installation of advanced deep conversion refinery technology to reduce the production of HSFO, and 3) expanding the refinery's capacity from 50,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd. Company has already spent US$50 million for feed study for the upgradation and expansion project. Upgradation project aims to change the shape of the product barrel Feed study completion is expected by 2QFY25, followed by submission of EPC-F bids in 3QFY24, selection of EPCC-f contractor in 4QFY25, and the award of the EPC contract and financial close by 2QFY26. Once financial closure is obtained, the construction and EPC phase, along with project commissioning, is expected to be completed by 4QFY28. Regarding the refining policy, PRL has already signed it, but the process may be delayed as other refineries are still in the process of signing. However, PRL is already receiving incentives under the Refinery Policy, which are being allocated to the Special Reserve head and will be accessible after achieving financial close. The deadline set by SIFC for resolving issues related to the refinery upgradation policy has passed. However, management stated that SIFC remains fully involved in addressing the issue. The delays are due to the policy being announced in the budget, and removing it would require parliamentary action or a mini-budget. As a result, discussions are ongoing regarding alternative options to compensate or facilitate refineries. Management stated that under the Refinery Policy 2023, their dividend-paying capacity is neither capped nor restricted. The scrip is not in formal coverage of AKD Securities, but the brokerage house believes that the company's production is immune to subdued demand amid adoption of solar powered tube wells and the increasing acceptance of EVs and hybrid cars in the country, due to heavy reliance of country on imports. With the expansion, the company’s plan to phase out its furnace oil production aligns well with the country's shift in its power mix. However, smuggling of diesel remains to be a key threat to the refining sector.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5AE5gLTSm6nv	2024-11-29T20:14:47-08:00	
PSX Closes The Week At Historic High Despite Volatility – OpEd	Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained volatile throughout the week ended on November 29, 2024. The volatility stemmed from acceleration in political instability amid opposition party reaching to protest in the country’s Capital, creating uncertainty amongst the investor, leading to a major fall in benchmark index, marking a decrease of 3,506 points on Tuesday. However, the market regained its momentum on Wednesday after the protestors started to back off from Islamabad and the momentum was further fueled by a circular from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), removing the MDR requirements on deposits held by Commercial banks of financial institutions and public sector enterprises. This led to the KSE-100 index registering its highest ever intra-day gains of 4,695 points on Wednesday, and closing at a record high of 101,357 points on Friday, marking an increase of 3.6%WoW. Major contributing sectors to this rally were commercial banks, contributing 1,675 points, followed by Technology & Communication with 349 points, and Oil & Gas Exploration, which added 283 points during the week. However, with another circular from the SBP revising its guidelines for profit sharing on saving deposits for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs), which resulted in MEBL eroding 439 points during the week. Secondary market yields on the 6-month bill decreased to 12.12%, dropping to the lowest levels seen in over 2.5 years. Foreign exchange reserves held by SBP increased by US$131 million WoW, ending the week at US$11.4 billion as of November 22, 2024. Average daily trading volume remained higher, up by 39.8%WoW, rising to 1.4 billion shares, as compared to 990.7 million shares traded a week ago. PKR witnessed a meagre depreciation of 0.1% against the greenback during the week to close at 278.05PKR/US$.

Shadow Wars At The Durand Line: Unmasking The Threat	The unchecked rise of cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghanistan has become a pressing concern for Pakistan and the broader region. Recent incidents along the Durand Line, including armed incursions, improvised explosive device (IED) attacks, and the kidnapping of Pakistani security forces, expose the Taliban’s glaring failure to maintain control over Afghan territory. These developments not only undermine regional stability but also signal the dangerous potential of Afghanistan becoming a hub for extremism once again. In this context, the statement from US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller, acknowledging the threat posed by terror bases in Afghanistan, is a significant endorsement of Pakistan’s long-standing concerns. For years, Islamabad has warned the international community about the operational capacity of militant groups thriving under the Taliban’s watch. The US’s recognition of this issue affirms the validity of these concerns and dismantles the illusion that Pakistan’s warnings were overstated. The Taliban’s takeover in August 2021 came with promises of peace and stability, but the reality on the ground tells a starkly different story. The resurgence of groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) has cast a long shadow over Afghanistan’s purported stability. Despite repeated assurances, the Taliban’s inability to neutralize these factions exposes critical vulnerabilities in their governance model. The rise in militant activity near the Durand Line underscores the Taliban’s inability—or unwillingness—to confront extremist elements. These groups not only pose a direct threat to Pakistan but also jeopardize the security of Central and South Asia. The Taliban’s continued denial of these realities reflects a dangerous delusion that risks escalating into larger conflicts if left unaddressed. Recent incidents along the Durand Line highlight the operational prowess of militant networks operating in Afghanistan. Cross-border attacks, kidnappings, and explosions are not isolated events; they are part of a larger strategy to destabilize Pakistan and exploit the porous border for terror activities. These incidents debunk the Taliban’s claims of maintaining complete control and reveal a governance vacuum that militant groups are exploiting with impunity. The implications of such activities extend far beyond Pakistan. The Durand Line is a critical artery for trade, diplomacy, and security in the region. Its destabilization has the potential to disrupt vital economic corridors and worsen already tense relations between regional powers. Afghanistan’s inability to address cross-border threats has transformed the Durand Line into a volatile flashpoint, endangering both regional and international interests. The evolving collaboration between the US and Pakistan to address cross-border terrorism represents a crucial step in the fight against extremism. Both nations have a shared interest in dismantling terror networks that threaten stability in South Asia and beyond. This partnership reflects a recognition of the seriousness of the issue and the need for a coordinated response. For Pakistan, this collaboration is not just about security—it is about survival. As a frontline state, Pakistan has borne the brunt of terrorism for decades, making its counter-terrorism efforts a matter of national importance. The US’s acknowledgment of these challenges reinforces Pakistan’s role as a key player in regional security and highlights the importance of its contributions to global counter-terrorism initiatives. The unchecked growth of militant networks in Afghanistan poses systemic risks to the entire region. Beyond the immediate threat of terrorism, these groups could disrupt critical infrastructure, destabilize governments, and exacerbate existing geopolitical rivalries. The consequences of inaction are dire: a region plagued by violence, economic stagnation, and political instability. The international community must recognize the gravity of these threats and act accordingly. This includes pressuring the Taliban to take decisive action against extremist groups and providing support to countries like Pakistan that are on the frontlines of this fight. Ignoring these risks will only embolden militant networks and create new challenges for global peace and security. Addressing the threats posed by Afghanistan’s terror networks requires a multi-faceted approach. Military action alone cannot solve the problem. Instead, it must be complemented by diplomatic engagement, economic development, and efforts to address the root causes of extremism. For Pakistan, this means maintaining a delicate balance between counter-terrorism operations and constructive engagement with Afghan leadership. While military action is necessary to neutralize immediate threats, long-term stability will require fostering cross-border development projects, promoting inclusive governance, and ensuring that Afghanistan does not revert to being a global hotspot for terrorism. The threat posed by cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan is neither an isolated issue nor a hypothetical concern—it is a pressing reality with far-reaching implications. The acknowledgment of this threat by the US marks a critical turning point, validating Pakistan’s concerns and highlighting the need for urgent, coordinated action. As Afghanistan’s instability continues to ripple across the region, Pakistan’s role as a stabilizing force becomes increasingly vital. By fostering collaboration with international partners and addressing the root causes of extremism, the region can work toward a more secure and peaceful future. However, the success of these efforts will depend on the international community’s willingness to confront the realities of Afghanistan’s governance challenges and take decisive action.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5A7v6L8moPO_	2024-11-29T19:58:10-08:00	
The Role Of Sports In Regional Harmony: Lessons From South Asia –...	Pakistan stands as a example of how sports can unify a nation and serve as a bridge between countries, even amidst political tensions. Its rich history in cricket, squash, hockey, and other sports has not only fostered national pride but has also exemplified the spirit of inclusivity and fair play. Over the years, Pakistan has consistently demonstrated its commitment to keeping sports above politics, contrasting sharply with India's approach, which has often been marred by politicization and selective participation, particularly in its interactions with Pakistan. A glaring instance of this divergence can be seen in India's refusal to participate in the Asia Cup 2023, hosted by Pakistan. This decision ignored Pakistan’s well-documented efforts to provide a secure and welcoming environment for international events. By boycotting the tournament, India not only undermined the regional spirit of sportsmanship but also deprived millions of fans of one of the most thrilling rivalries in cricket. In contrast, Pakistan has shown remarkable sportsmanship by consistently participating in Indian-hosted events, such as the ICC World Cups in 2011 and 2023, despite similar political tensions and security concerns. Cricket diplomacy has historically been a tool for easing tensions in South Asia. Pakistan has often taken the lead in this regard, as exemplified by General Zia-ul-Haq’s bold visit to India during a cricket series in 1987, amidst heightened political tensions. This gesture was not only an act of goodwill but also a testament to Pakistan’s belief in the unifying power of sports. Unfortunately, India has not reciprocated this sentiment, refusing to engage in bilateral series or participate in Pakistan-hosted tournaments. Such actions not only sideline the potential of sports as a bridge for dialogue but also diminish the broader regional significance of these events. Pakistan’s inclusive approach extends beyond cricket. The nation has regularly granted visas to Indian athletes for a variety of sports events, including squash, wrestling, and tennis. These gestures underscore Pakistan’s commitment to fostering regional harmony and mutual respect. India, on the other hand, has frequently denied Pakistani athletes the opportunity to participate in events on its soil, citing political differences or security concerns. This selective engagement not only hampers the growth of sports in the region but also denies athletes valuable opportunities to compete and showcase their talent. The economic implications of India’s boycotts are also worth noting. Organizing international sports events requires significant investment in infrastructure, security, and logistics. India’s refusal to participate in these tournaments results in financial losses for the host country, affecting sponsorships, broadcasting revenues, and tourism. Pakistan, however, has proven resilient, hosting successful events like the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which has gained international acclaim for its organization and competitiveness. The PSL’s success demonstrates Pakistan’s ability to overcome challenges and deliver high-quality sporting events. India’s approach also alienates fans, who eagerly anticipate high-stakes matches between the two nations. Cricket, in particular, holds a unique cultural significance for both countries, and matches between Pakistan and India transcend mere sport to become moments of shared passion and history. By politicizing sports, India deprives fans on both sides of the border of these cherished experiences, eroding the unifying potential of such events. In contrast, Pakistan’s consistent participation in Indian-hosted tournaments highlights its commitment to preserving the spirit of the game. The broader implications of India’s politicization of sports are troubling. By boycotting Pakistan-hosted events, India sets a dangerous precedent for other nations to prioritize politics over the unifying potential of sports. This not only threatens the cohesion of international sporting organizations but also undermines years of efforts to promote sports as a neutral ground for fostering peace and understanding. Pakistan’s proactive stance, on the other hand, exemplifies how sports can be used as a tool for peacebuilding and regional cooperation. In conclusion, Pakistan’s inclusive approach to sports stands as a testament to its commitment to unity, fairness, and regional harmony. By prioritizing sportsmanship over politics, Pakistan continues to set an example for the international community. India’s politicization of sports, in contrast, highlights a missed opportunity to leverage the unifying power of athletics for the betterment of the region. As the world looks to sports as a means of bridging divides, Pakistan’s efforts serve as a reminder of what can be achieved when the spirit of competition is allowed to thrive unimpeded.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWec3svNa7Yp1adKckWFjHSX	2024-11-29T19:56:05-08:00	
The Political Earthquake Amidst Manipur’s Religious Rift – OpEd	The violence in Manipur, India, has brought the growing tide of religious persecution in the country to the forefront. Since May 2023, the state has witnessed violent clashes between the Hindu Meitei and Christian Kuki communities, with over 415 lives lost and tens of thousands displaced. However, what is truly alarming is not only the violence itself but also the failure of India’s leadership to take decisive action in curbing the rising tide of religious intolerance. The indifference shown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government has allowed the persecution of religious minorities, particularly Christians, to flourish unchecked. Manipur’s unrest is rooted in complex ethnic and religious tensions. The Meitei, a predominantly Hindu community, have been demanding Scheduled Tribe status, a move that has been fiercely opposed by the Kuki community, which is largely Christian. The demand for Scheduled Tribe status is seen by many as a means of securing affirmative action benefits, which would favor the Meitei population over other groups in the state, including the Christian Kukis. This has led to violent clashes, with the Kuki people bearing the brunt of the attacks. The violence has been particularly devastating for the Christian community in Manipur. Over 360 churches have been destroyed, and more than 7,000 homes and properties have been looted and burned. This destruction is not just an attack on property; it is an attack on the very identity of the Christian community in the region. The demolition of churches and the displacement of Christian families have left deep scars that will take years to heal. Despite the scale of the destruction, Prime Minister Modi and his government have failed to offer more than a cursory response to the crisis. The silence of the Indian government has been deafening. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, has been outspoken in his criticism of Modi’s failure to visit Manipur or even acknowledge the scale of the violence. Gandhi’s calls for action highlight the political nature of the violence, which has been exacerbated by the growing influence of Hindutva ideology. Hindutva, which promotes the vision of India as a Hindu nation, has increasingly driven policies that marginalize religious minorities, particularly Muslims and Christians. This ideological shift has not only fueled violence but also deepened the ethnic and religious divisions in Manipur. The impact of Hindutva-driven policies is evident not only in Manipur but across the country. Christians in India have faced increasing attacks on their places of worship, harassment, and forced conversions. According to reports from civil society organizations, there were 161 incidents of violence against Christians between January and March 2024, with a significant concentration in Chhattisgarh. The attacks on Christians in India are not isolated incidents but part of a larger pattern of religious persecution that has worsened under Modi’s government. Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scholar, has argued that Hindutva policies are weaponizing affirmative action and exacerbating ethnic and communal divisions. The elevation of Hindu Scheduled Castes in Manipur, a move designed to benefit the Meitei Hindu community, has only intensified the persecution of Christians in the region. The government’s reluctance to address the root causes of the violence in Manipur reflects a broader failure to protect the rights of religious minorities in India. As the situation in Manipur continues to deteriorate, the international community must take a stand. The United States and other global powers have a responsibility to speak out against the religious oppression in India and pressure the Indian government to address the crisis. The silence of the international community in the face of these atrocities is deeply troubling. Human rights organizations, particularly those focused on religious freedom, must raise their voices in solidarity with the persecuted Christian community in Manipur and across India. In conclusion, the violence in Manipur is a reflection of the broader religious persecution sweeping through India. The silence of Prime Minister Modi and his government in the face of this violence is unacceptable. The international community must act to hold the Indian government accountable for its failure to protect the rights of religious minorities. The growing influence of Hindutva extremism in India threatens not only the country’s social fabric but also its commitment to secularism and democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWec3svNa7Yp1c3nVjrvG_lg	2024-11-29T19:51:24-08:00	
The Trump Factor And Iran’s Choices – Analysis	By Gaddam Dharmendra In recent weeks, the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been compelled to cope with mounting challenges on multiple fronts, and typically, the Iranians have responded with their penchant and affinity to indulge in playing multi-dimensional chess. Good on paper but difficult to pull off. In a series of visits and outreach, senior Iranian officials have been lobbying capitals across the region. In parallel, there has been carefully choreographed posts on social media platforms, including X (formerly known as Twitter). Both tracks are moving in tandem and are characteristically a mix of bravado and obfuscation. But this heightened Iranian diplomatic activity masks growing concerns within top leadership levels, of Iran’s deep seated but well concealed structural vulnerabilities which now stand exposed like never before. Tehran’s anxieties First and foremost, the most obvious cause for Iran’s anxiety is Donald Trump’s re-election. The main actors tasked to drive President-elect Trump’s foreign policy have been announced, giving an insight into the policy priorities and preferred direction of Trump’s second term. All pointers are of continuity of the avowedly pro-Israel stance witnessed in the first term. A resumption of the muscular approach towards Iran is certainly in the offing. This is bound to be compounded by allegations of Iran’s involvement in an alleged plot to assassinate Trump. Not surprisingly, statements emanating from Iran soon after Trump’s election signal a carefully calibrated yet nuanced dialing down of their hitherto confrontationist approach. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi took to X, rejecting the FBI’s assassination charges and advising that for the US the 'The path forward is (also) a choice. It begins with respect.' In the same post, Araghchi categorically assures that 'Iran is NOT after nuclear weapons, period.' Given also the tumultuous precedence of Trump’s cabinet during his first term, the regular parade of dismissals and resignations, Trump’s appointments would need to be viewed with a degree of caution as regards the longevity of each appointee and consequently of policy consistency. But then Trump thrives on pulling off the unpredictable. Second are widespread assessments that Trump’s foreign policy priorities will include ending the war in Ukraine and restoring the maximum pressure on Iran witnessed in his first term. Any outcome on the former is likely to impinge on the latter, given the transactional relationship which Russia and Iran have established in recent years. Cessation of hostilities in Ukraine could free up the US to re-engage Russia and potentially enlist Russian support in the UNSC/IAEA on the Iran file. Third, the recent months have seen Iran suffer a series of devastating if self-inflicted setbacks. Israel has reestablished its military dominance by inflicting irreparable damage to Iran’s Axis of Resistance across Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. The targeted decimation of top commanders and cadres of Hamas and Hezbollah, along with their weapons and missile stores, and disruption to Iran’s ability to use the Syrian land-route for supplies has severely crippled the Axis. Consequently, Iran’s pursuit of a forward defense strategy, of encircling and cornering Israel through these proxy militia groups as part of its 'ring of fire' strategy, has been eroded, perhaps irreversibly. Related to this, and yet another cause of concern for Iran, has been Israeli intelligence’s deep penetration and compromise of the Axis. Israel’s HUMINT assets were important inputs leading to the assassination of high value targets such as Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and Hamas’ Ismail Haniyeh in a safehouse in Tehran guarded by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The rate of attrition has been such that the IRGC even decided to pull back several of its field commanders due to these losses including the death of its commander Mohammad Reza Zahedi in Israel’s bombing of the Annex housing the Iranian consular section in Damascus. That an Iranian fingerprint is present across every trouble spot in the Levant is further evidenced by the fact that Iran has enabled the rise of a new Axis benefactor in the form of the Houthis in Yemen. Houthi missiles have repeatedly struck deep inside Israel and disrupted shipping in the vital sea lanes along the Red Sea and Suez Canal routes. The latter has had a global impact, effecting supply chains and raising the cost of shipping and insurance. Fourth is the dangerous emergence into the open of the long running hostility between Israel and Iran. Both have shed their decades long shadow war and have, till date, exchanged two rounds of direct attacks on each other’s territory, the latest being the October 26 Israeli strikes on Iran. While reports from within Iran are typically difficult to discern as to their factual accuracy, Israel has claimed that it has decapacitated much of Iran’s air defenses giving it freedom to operate at will within Iran. Last but not the least are the rapid strides in Iran’s nuclear programme. Its stockpiles of enriched uranium are well beyond the limits set by the now defunct JCPOA, including 164 kg of uranium U-235 enriched to 60% (data is as per IAEA’s quarterly report for August 2024). These levels are within touching distance of the vital threshold of 90% enriched U-235 needed for a nuclear weapon. These capabilties make Iran the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to levels well beyond that needed for peaceful purposes. The changed West Asia landscape In dealing with Iran, the in-coming Trump Administration will have to contend with the reality of the unprecedented changes that have taken place in the preceding four years in the stubbornly challenging West Asia landscape. Trump will have to contend with and shape his policies around several new factors which have emerged and are now driving regional dynamics. The most important of these, representing a fundamental shift, is the mutual courtship between Iran and its neighbors. Iran’s late President Ebrahim Raesi, a surprise ascendent to the presidency in August 2021, put in place the twin foreign policy pillars of stabilizing Iran’s neighborhood and pursuing a pronounced anti-west policy in the guise of a look east policy. Thus, Iran’s pursuit of its version of neighborhood first, received initially with caution by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), gave way to the current sustained and wider engagement led mainly by the Saudis and the Emiratis. Here, two inter-related dynamics are at play. From Iran’s perspective, normalizing relations with the GCC enables it to address the latent threat posed to its regional ambitions by the Abraham Accords. And, from the GCC’s perspective, setting aside deep-seated historic and sectarian divisions by engaging Iran frees them up from the threat of potentially damaging strikes Iran had previously demonstrated viz. in 2019 Iran was widely held responsible for sabotaging shipping in the Hormuz Strait, the audacious shooting down of a US RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV and the impressively precise drone strikes on Saudi’s Aramco oil facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais). The GCC’s overarching calculus is to avoid a confrontation with a near neighbor, one that would have incalculable economic costs and set back the ambitious reform agendas being pursued by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and the Emirates’ Mohammad bin Zayed. As political scientist Avron Oshtavar posits: 'Iran’s improved regional standing and strengthening ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in particular, will make it difficult for the Trump administration to replicate its previous strategy toward Iran. Although Washington might try, Iran can no longer be as easily marginalised, and America’s Arab partners are unlikely to want to assist in the reinforcement of existing sanctions on Iran.' On Iran’s nuclear programme, Trump will have to contend with the consequences of his disastrous May 2018 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal or JCPOA. This time around, he can take advantage of several fortuitous developments. First, Iran’s weapons program appears to have been dealt a severe blow by recent Israeli strikes. Reports have claimed that in its strikes carried out in late October, Israel had successfully struck a top-secret Iranian nuclear weapon’s research facility at Parchin (near Tehran). These reports perhaps help explain Araghchi’s post conveying a categorical assurance that Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons. Parsing beyond the standard Iranian trait of bluster and combative rhetoric, this is a reasonable opening for all sides to address Iran’s nuclear issue. This is evident from Iran’s hasty green lighting of the long-delayed visit to Tehran by DG-IAEA Rafael Grossi. It is no coincidence that the Grossi’s visit took place within weeks of Trump’s reelection and Israeli claims of striking the Parchin nuclear research facilities. In fact, during his visit to Tehran, Grossi said: 'I made a request for Iran to stop increasing the stockpile of 60% and this was accepted. This is what we agreed and I hope this will hold. We will see.' The JCPOA legally expires in October next year. Foreign Minister Araghchi and others in Iran have signalled a willingness to negotiate a new deal based on the JCPOA but taking into consideration the changed realities. Trump the archetypical dealmaker, with his uniquely unconventional approach to international relations, can tease out the ‘bazaari’ in the Iranians and cajole them to settle for a deal. We have before us some interesting scenarios. The fact is, Iran is in a much weaker position than ever since the 1979 revolution. While its brutal internal repression has secured it against domestic challengers, its external overreach through its Axis proxies has proved costly. Iran is clearly hurting from the series of setbacks dealt by Israel in recent months. This is therefore an opportune time to be seized by all sides.

No Easy Cure For The Philippines’ HIV Crisis – Analysis	By Marph Daryl O Porras Since the first confirmed case of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the Philippines in 1984, cases have skyrocketed, with an average of 55 individuals diagnosed daily in 2024. This surge has highlighted the urgent need to address the rapidly evolving HIV epidemic in the country. Despite efforts from government agencies and non-governmental organisations, regulating the growing number of cases remains a significant challenge. The amendment of the Republic Act (RA) 8504 to RA 11166 in December 2018 represented a significant step forward in the Philippines’ response to the HIV epidemic. The expanded provisions on HIV screening and the inclusion of a community-based approach are crucial for addressing the growing number of cases and improving access to healthcare for people living with HIV. But the implementation of RA 11166 faces several challenges. Limited resources for HIV prevention, screening, treatment and care, coupled with pervasive stigmatisation and discrimination of HIV patients, can reduce individuals’ motivation to get tested and seek treatment. Ensuring accessibility to HIV services for all, regardless of sexual orientation and socioeconomic status, is crucial but challenging. Articles IV and VI of RA 11166 legally protect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals with HIV/AIDS and prohibit compulsory HIV testing unless medically necessary. Despite these challenges, RA 11166 represents a significant opportunity for the Philippines to improve its response to the HIV epidemic. By effectively implementing its provisions and addressing the underlying challenges, the Philippines can make progress in reducing HIV transmission, improving the lives of people living with HIV and promoting sexual health for all. How HIV is perceived and experienced within communities plays a significant role in exacerbating the epidemic. Vulnerable groups in HIV transmission — including men who have sex with men — represented 89 per cent of new HIV infections in 2023. The mobility of such vulnerable groups makes it more challenging and complicated to analyse the spatial distribution of HIV. Individuals may undergo HIV testing in a different location from where they live but continue their high-risk behaviours in their local communities, complicating the HIV response. Addressing the HIV epidemic in the Philippines requires a collaborative, multi-sectoral approach, sustained political commitment and active community involvement. While non-governmental organisations have made significant strides in implementing transformative programs, government leadership is crucial for sustainable impact. The Philippines can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for people living with HIV by prioritising government efforts to combat stigma, partnering with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to strengthen interventions, focusing on prevention and treatment and advocating for policy changes. Specifically, the government can use its existing partnerships with NGOs to further strengthen community-based organisations, which are well placed to aid prevention and treatment since they already work directly in the community. The government should also consider establishing community-based organisations in areas where HIV cases are rising. In terms of policy change, local ordinances — especially those related to confidentiality and HIV testing — must be aligned with the amended Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy Act. It is also essential to address the challenges of limited healthcare access in various regions. Investing in upgrading HIV care facilities — especially in areas with a high prevalence of HIV — and providing specialised training for healthcare providers can help ensure quality care and improve outcomes. By addressing both societal stigma and healthcare access, the Philippines can make significant progress in combating the HIV epidemic and improving the lives of people living with HIV. While many HIV care facilities and treatment hubs have been established across the Philippines, the implementation of their programs has varying success. Challenges include the unstable supply of diagnostics and the use and monitoring of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medications used to prevent HIV transmission through sexual contact or injection drug use. These challenges undermine the effectiveness of the HIV response in addressing the growing number of HIV cases, particularly in regions with high prevalence. In urban areas of the Philippines, where HIV cases are substantial, healthcare facilities offer essential frontline services such as HIV screening, confirmatory testing and antiretroviral therapy. But the quality of these services often falls short of meeting the needs of the increasing number of HIV patients. This is particularly challenging at the local level due to the absence of local AIDS ordinancesthat adhere to their mandate. To improve healthcare access for HIV patients, it is crucial that facilities are adequately equipped to handle the high volume of cases in their regions. This may involve investing in additional resources, upgrading facilities and specialised training for healthcare providers. To address stigma and discrimination, the Philippines should strengthen education and information dissemination as stipulated in Article II of RA 11166. The sense of urgency in taking meaningful action is evident as cases continue to rise where patients as young as 15 years old are being diagnosed with HIV. Action is needed to mainstream HIV/AIDS policies and conduct further study on risk behaviours, stigma and discrimination in the Philippines.

Digging Up The Roots Of Human Culture – Analysis	What led humans on the unique path of cultural development? And can we do anything useful with newly reconstructed histories of this process? Culture is central to defining humanity. Throughout history, many definitions have been proposed to describe what we mean when we talk about culture, leading to considerable confusion. The word 'culture' was once reserved to designate the customs and behaviors of particular groups of people in specific regions and timeframes. In recent years, however, definitions concerning what is and what is not culture have widened considerably, to the point where 'culture' is now used to describe the behaviors of numerous life forms. For example, it has become common to refer to culture when describing the social structures of sperm whales and other animals, including insects. But while animal culture denotes behaviors that are learned and socially transmitted, human cultural practices go further, transforming these behaviors into coded systems that are reproduced within specific group settings. This explains the emergence of tradition—a key element of culture that seems exclusive to humans. Traditions provide abstract mechanisms through which humans symbolically assimilate the concept of identity over time. This deeply symbolic derivation is only observed in humans. Human societies imbue culture with a network of meanings that can be shared and understood symbolically by individuals belonging to a particular social structure (family, tribe, community, and nation). The further we go back in time, the more difficult it becomes to reestablish the abstract (contingent) connections that once linked these symbols to their meanings. Over time, human culture has not only included the concrete manifestations of extrasomatic survival strategies but also encompassed abstract notions that are barely perceptible in archeological records. The emergence of stone tools more than 3 million years ago marks the birth of culture in the human lineage. When the first Homo habilis remains were discovered at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in the early 1960s, its name, which means handyman, was based on the idea that this hominin was the first toolmaker. This justified its placement at the root of the human family tree: the first species of the genus Homo. However, this anthropocentric denomination proved to be short-lived. As early as the 1970s, the probability that other genuses, like Australopithecines and Paranthropus, were also making tools, came to light in some archeological records. This likelihood continues to be supported by new data, including discoveries of sites yielding stone tools that predate the emergence of H. habilis. Because they were systematically made using techniques that had to be learned and shared communally, these activities meet the standard definition of culture used by cultural anthropologists. Furthermore, the repetitive technologies employed to make stone tools are defined as traditions, adding further weight toward culture. From this stage forward, for a period spanning almost the entire evolutionary trajectory of our genus (some 2.8 million years), stone toolkits provide virtually the only material evidence that catalogs successive phases of human cultural evolution leading to the present. Ancient stone tools are essential for tracking cultures and their interactions. In studying them, we can see how culture evolves on uneven pathways on a cumulative trajectory. As human societies grew and sharpened their technological capacity, their cultural repertoire expanded, a process characterized not only by the empirical remains of their material culture but also by increasingly elaborate symbolic behaviors that—we logically infer—mirror the emergence of human consciousness. The complex interplay of inter- and intra-human population exchanges and the capacity for learning, along with curiosity and inventiveness, have combined through time to create our species' current state. Despite the fragmentary nature of archeological records, studying ancient stone toolkits brings to light precious information allowing us to recognize culture in the deep past. Lithic specialists, for example, identify and describe the specific stylistic traits and chains of production in the toolkits, permitting scientific inferences that contribute to the knowledge about our cognitive evolution. Archeologists combine 'cultural' data with fossil genomics to track and compare hominin lineages and reconstruct the 2.8 million-year-old story of our genus. They are seeing a braided account of populations distinguished by their cultural manifestations and divided into groups with divergent species across continents. Today, however, with only one species of Homo remaining on the planet (H. sapiens), the supposed intra-human differences no longer have any biological foundation and have been laid bare for what they are: purely symbolic cultural constructions. Parallels are drawn to compare human expressions of culture and analogous behaviors in other life forms. This is demonstrated in primate studies and has often been recognized in the pioneering work of Jane Goodall in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, during the 1960s, when she observed wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) modifying branches and using them as tools to probe for termites in termite mounds. Some believe these observations could serve as a template for early hominin toolmaking behavior, a hypothesis supported by the close genetic proximity of chimpanzees to humans and their apparent physical similarities. Primate toolmaking capacity continues to be explored in the wild and in captivity, yielding probing results. Interestingly, other animals, such as crows, practice surprisingly similar behaviors, also modifying leaves to probe into crevices to retrieve insects, and even inventing compound tools. These 'crow tools' are uncannily similar to those made by chimpanzees; the manufacturing processes, aims, and outcomes are also comparable. Undoubtedly, there is a considerable gap separating the degree to which humans have developed material and immaterial cultures and the behaviors we observe in other animals. Through time, only humans have developed toolmaking into a fundamental adaptive strategy resulting in the techno-dependent species we have become. More importantly, only humans imbue their manufactured objects and behaviors with symbolically relevant identitarian meaning. Language is a central pillar in any discussion about human culture and its origins; its emergence has been linked to the evolution of stone tool technologies. As early Homo reaped the benefits of their toolmaking capacity, they also increased their ability to compete with other animals for resources and these advantages gave them more free time to develop innovative ways to expand their benefits. Through time, successive hominin ancestors invented new and increasingly complex toolkits, requiring individuals to spend more time learning to make them. This process eventually came to depend on vocal communication strategies. Paleoanthropologists have demonstrated that the cerebral and anatomical configurations necessary for spoken language could have resulted from changes in craniofacial features occurring over millions of years, as early hominins adapted to upright stature and bipedal locomotion. As hominins came to rely on specific kinds of stone tools, the conditions that made language physically possible also led to its selection and development as an advantageous adaptive culture-sharing strategy. When we think about what is unique about human culture, we often consider technology as central to characterizing civilizations. Technologies have evolved over time to synchronize culture in a way that assimilates individuals into discrete (but potentially huge) collaborative social units; in doing so, it plays a vital role in the mental construction of both personal and shared identities. Sharing culture and technological know-how creates a common sense of time. Museums, historical sites, and fictional history present the past through symbols of progress or failure and thus serve to chart a shared timeline. Although archeological records correspond to a series of sequential stages—advancing our species through a process of 'progress'—there is no inherent hierarchy to these developments, either at the biological or the cultural levels. For those educated within a cultural framework that explains prehistory as a linear and codependent set of chronological milestones—whose successive stages are understood by conjured logical systems of cause and effect—this outlook is going to take time to be accepted. It takes an intellectual leap to reject such hierarchical constructions of prehistory and to perceive the past as a system of nonsynchronous events closely tied to the shifting ecological and biological phenomena. This endeavor, however, allows people to recognize and use the lessons offered by the past. Notably, the fact that complexity of modern human culture results from baseline learning processes bolstered through time by biosocial adaptations. The long-term processes involved in human techno-selection have been compared to Darwinian natural selection: like biological evolution, technosocial innovations can emerge and persist, or remain latent in the human repertory. When specific conditions arise, they can be selected and, if successful, be developed into defining aspects of the human condition. At each stage of evolution, latent technological capacities exist within the structure of cultural variability; in different regions or time frames, they are selected, used, and refined, leading human groups to choose divergent evolutionary pathways. Refining these skills can even trigger technological revolutions; when the changes lead to positive results, they can set off wider cultural transformations in the populations that use them. Culture evolves along diachronic trends. Distinct evolutionary stages occur (or not) in different areas of the world, sometimes in very divergent chronological frameworks. Humans have learned to adapt to rapid cumulative technological change by developing complex social behaviors as an adaptive response that favors the survival of our species. This process may have started gradually, but with the accumulation of breakthroughs, it continues in leaps and bounds into the present day. Triggering a social response that could evolve in parallel to technological progress resulted in the emergence and sharpening of cultural traditions and identities, springboarding our genus toward exponential increases in social complexity. The archeological records and our own intuitive cerebral processes preserve the memory of our acquired anatomical and cultural developments. They are two sides of the same coin that evolved throughout human prehistory and beyond. Like other primates, humans are social animals, and as individuals, we need to learn, imitate, and emulate 'acceptable' behaviors within specific contexts. Culture represents the set of norms transmitted from generation to generation and dictates how individuals must behave to maintain social balance. Humanity shares and exchanges culture, but over time, we have also learned to exploit the constructed sets of cultural norms that define the social unit we belong to and justify the exclusion of people living in less favorable situations. Humanity uses culture to invent differences between people with identical biological makeup, needs, and desires. We have an increasingly useful 7-million-year-old global data set to better understand ourselves and how to survive and improve our well-being. With time, it will be increasingly recognized that using this information as a reference and planning tool is advantageous for practically every endeavor.

Trade And Tariffs To Dominate US-China Ties Under Trump – Analysi...	By Alex Willemyns Donald Trump has made no secret of his plans to hit China with massive tariffs. The only question is how much exactly. Calling tariffs 'the most beautiful word in the dictionary,' the president-elect threatened during the 2024 election campaign to hit Chinese imports with tariffs of 'more than' 60%, effectively slamming the brakes on trade between the world’s two biggest economies. On Monday, he said that whatever rate was ultimately levied, there would be an extra 10% tariff on top of that to punish Beijing for continued outflows of precursors for the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which U.S. authorities say is killing around 75,000 Americans a year. All that suggests that the U.S.-China relationship looks set under the second Trump presidency to become increasingly dominated by a grand rebalancing of trade ties, experts told Radio Free Asia. In many ways, they said, things will pick right up from where Trump left them in January 2021, having hit China with some $50 billion worth of tariffs, which the Biden administration has since declined to roll back. Yet things may be a lot different this time. Trump tariffs 2.0 Beijing now has nearly a decade of experience in dealing with trade pressure from the United States, said Shanghai-based Han Lin, the China country director for the Asia Group business consultancy. While the world’s second-biggest economy was looking to increased exports as its ticket out of slumping growth, he said, Chinese economic officials also now have experience with retaliatory measures and knowledge of how best to hit back at aggressive U.S. policies. 'China is better prepared now than during Trump 1.0,' Lin told RFA. 'It has a wider range of carrot-and-stick trade responses, but the ever-present need for foreign investment may calibrate their behavior to send a message of strength without unnecessary escalation.' A likely response from Beijing, he explained, would be to let the Chinese yuan 'drift weaker,' so the exchange rate with the U.S. dollar makes Chinese goods more competitive for American buyers without directly needing to confront Trump or spark a tit-for-tat trade war. 'This will help offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on China exporters,' he said, noting they would 'inevitably' get requests to lower their prices from American importers looking to avoid their own revenue losses. But it’s not even clear yet how much damage control will be needed. Zhiwu Chen, a professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong, said China’s leadership likely saw Trump’s campaign threats of 60% tariffs as more of a 'negotiating tactic' than a solid policy promise. From Beijing’s view, he said, the final tariff rate was likely to be lower – especially if China agrees to buy more American exports like agricultural goods or oil, thereby mitigating the U.S. current account deficit. 'What the leadership in Beijing learned from Trump 1.0 is that he is for real and transactional, kind of like an open book, so they may prefer his style, though they don’t like his bare-knuckle style,' Chen said, adding he believed trade ties could even 'warm up somewhat in 2025.' Trump ally Elon Musk would be a key dissenting voice in the White House, he explained, and would advocate against a total decoupling with the Chinese market, given his extensive business ties there. 'Elon Musk can be counted on to temper that push as Tesla depends so much on the China market,' Chen told Radio Free Asia. The art of the deal Others are less convinced that the author of the 'The Art of the Deal' is necessarily so focussed this time on striking a deal with Beijing. Tao Wang, the Hong Kong-based chief China economist at the UBS Investment Bank, noted that China’s government would not blush at the idea of negotiating with Trump to find a new status quo. 'I think the Chinese government would be very open to having a deal,' Wang at a Nov. 20 event at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'It’s just not really clear to me what Trump would want.' 'Last time, he said he’s the great salesperson – he wants to sell more soybeans, and LNG, and all these American products,' she said. 'Now he seems to want something different: He wants fiscal revenue from tariffs, and he wants to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.' On the campaign trail and in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 10, Trump touted the fiscal revenue a 60% tariff on Chinese imports would generate, arguing that the funds paid by Chinese importers could even offset tax cuts for Americans. Still, even if Trump is serious about the 60% Chinese tariff rate, the practicalities of governing could temper his plans once in office. At the same Nov. 20 event, Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the campaign pledges of tariffs on China would be the easy part for Trump. When so many basic goods used by American consumers and businesses come from inexpensive Chinese sources, she argued, implementing the tariffs without fanning inflation would be the hard part. Economists warn that the tariffs on China will accelerate inflation just as the U.S. economy is recovering from an extended bout of surging prices. 'I don’t think anyone really knows how realistic his team has been about alternative sources,' Lovely said, explaining that the current White House had been struggling to diversify U.S. supply chains. 'We saw that in the Biden administration, where there was effort to create alternatives. They really didn’t make a whole lot of progress,' she said. 'This is a really difficult problem. I’m afraid we don’t know if the new team has really faced up to how difficult it is going to be.' Dear leader One thing seems clear though, and that’s that the U.S.-China relationship will increasingly be defined by the personal relationship between Xi and Trump, who in his first term variously expressed both admiration and disdain for China’s authoritarian leader. 'President Trump will probably want to engage directly with President Xi, and the leader-to-leader level interaction will color and inform the agenda and the tone of the relationship going forward,' said Ryan Hass, the director of the Brookings Institution’s John L. Thornton China Center, at an event hosted by the think tank on Friday. The Biden administration struggled to ignite talks between lower-level U.S. and Chinese officials. Bilateral tensions saw many Chinese officials – even the defense minister – ignore overtures from their U.S. counterparts, fearing the consequences of appearing too friendly. After Biden and Xi’s high-profile summit in San Francisco last November, though, cooperation at the lower levels was resumed. Still, Hass cautioned that Trump would not have absolute power in his dealmaking with Xi. Pressure would remain on him to maintain close alliances with allies like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, he said. 'President Trump is not Kim Jong Un: He does not decide by fiat what the United States is, or where the United States is going,' Hass said, noting Trump was now 'elderly' and 'in his final term' as president. He pointed to Rep. Matt Gaetz’s decision last week – apparently forced by Trump – to step aside as the nominee for attorney-general amid private opposition even from Trump-allied Senate Republicans. 'I mention that because President Trump’s views on alliances are also out-of-sync with the views of many members of Congress related to alliances,' Hass said, listing Senators Bill Hagerty, Jim Risch, Dan Sullivan and Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state. 'These are all Republicans who feel very strongly about the importance of alliances,' he said, 'so I encourage us to keep that front of mind.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazIjwOP08pqdw	2024-11-27T16:38:18-08:00	
Moldova’s Close Election Stands As Warning To Country’s Pro-Europ...	By David Smith (EurActiv) -- After suspected Russian interference in Moldova’s presidential election and EU referendum, Chisinau is calling for external support to consolidate its European path, while politicians have turned towards shoring up domestic political weaknesses ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections. On 20 October, Moldovan voters narrowly approved a referendum amending the constitution to include the national goal of EU integration by a vote of 50.4%. On 3 November, Moldova's President Maia Sandu won re-election in a runoff with Socialist candidate Alexandr Stoianoglo by 55% to 44%, thanks to high turnout among diaspora voters. Sandu narrowly lost the vote within Romania itself. Moldova’s former Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu recently wrote an opinion piecein Euractiv arguing that although the recent elections were closely contested, Moldovan voters sent a clear pro-European signal when factors such as global anti-incumbency sentiment and Russian interference were considered. While pro-European politicians in Moldova seek to portray an electoral victory, and opposition Socialist Party leaders declare that they do not recognize the results of the elections, all factions are attempting to impose their own narrative on a pair of close elections. The one narrative that is clear is the unprecedented nature of suspected Russian interference. Police have alleged that at least 130,000 citizens (around 7% of voter turnout in the runoff) received bribes via Russian banking apps in order to influence their votes. Following the election, police have levelled millions of Moldovan Lei in fines against voters who took bribes and continue investigations into Ilan Shor’s networks of voter bribery in Moldova. The scale of these efforts shocked Moldova and overwhelmed the systems meant to ensure a fair election. Prosecutors have alleged that the Russian security services coordinated the interference efforts and that one of their goals was to overwhelm Moldova’s justice system. In the first round of the presidential elections, Sandu’s campaign spent around $558,000, and the PAS party spent an additional $200,000 promoting the EU referendum. In the same period, police were able to track the $39 million spent by Ilan Shor’s network. This money represents voter bribery schemes in Moldova and not the extensive spending by Russian-linked oligarchs on platforms such as Facebook and Googlein the same time period. Additionally, there is emerging evidence of increasing anti-Moldovan influence campaigns pushed by Kremlin actors in Brussels and Washington and online in English. The sheer scale of resources at play is completely out of proportion with anything the Moldovan state has previously contended with. At the recent European Political Community Summit in Budapest, Sandu made her call clear, saying that Moldova needs more 'support to strengthen our institutions, to better protect democracy in the country.' Domestically, this election was a wake-up call that exposed serious political and institutional weaknesses that were leveraged by Russian interference. Moldova’s efforts at reforming the justice system and fighting corruption have been slow, and voters blame the government for the lack of tangible results. This was exemplified in the election itself, where courts showed themselves unable or unwilling to conduct speedy trials in cases of illicit financing. Thus far, no high-level Shor party officials have seen their cases completed in court, and all are free and continuing their political work as the trials stall on technicalities. Last week, Sandu levelled direct criticism at the country's Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office for a 'complete failure in the fight against large-scale corruption, especially political corruption.' She has also convened the Supreme Security Council to make urgent recommendations for a new direction in justice reform. Any such new direction will need to progress quickly in order for changes to take effect before the 2025 parliamentary elections, which are expected in June. If tangible progress is made, it could help secure the vote and allow PAS to run on the tangible accomplishments that their voters demand. However, it is unlikely that all the underlying political issues that this election also exposed will be solved. While Moldovan political parties have always scrambled traditional right vs leftpolitical definitions, income and class divisions can be clearly seen in voter behaviour. Sandu and her PAS Party draw the majority of their support from the diaspora and more urban and middle-class voters. These voters understand the geopolitical questions around EU membership, the free movement of people and capital and the benefits that they have personally felt from closer EU ties. Pro-Russian parties gather most of their voters from villages and towns where incomes are low, and infrastructure lags behind the increasingly European cities. These voters do not frequently travel to Europe or to the capital and are less likely to vote on clearly geopolitical issues. Moldova does not currently have any pro-EU political parties on the left end of the ideological spectrum making a credible pitch to these voters. Looking ahead to the 2025 parliamentary elections, this is the area likely to be targeted by the so-called 'pseudo-European' politicians and parties that resemble the politics of the Georgian Dream. These parties profess to support EU integration while stressing social wedge issues such as gay rights and language politics and calling for a 'balanced' foreign policy between Russia and Europe. The results of the recent elections indicate fertile ground for these positions going into next year’s parliamentary elections. Combined with suspected Russian interference efforts, massive spending, and the continued weakness of Moldova’s justice system, Sandu and the PAS Party are likely to face serious challenges in the year ahead.

Mass Deportations: Unfeasible, Expensive And Would Undermine Othe...	President-elect Donald Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants in American history. His appointment of Thomas Homan, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as border czar signals his commitment to that promise. There are 11.7 million people residing in the United States illegally. 'Bottom line,' says Homan, 'if you’re in the country illegally, you’re not off the table.' Realistically, however, it is hard to imagine carrying out a mass deportation anywhere close to that number. The huge costs involved—including the not-inconsequential hidden costs—are almost certain to limit its scale. While discussing executive orders being written for the president to sign immediately after his inauguration, Trump transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, 'On Day One he’s going to open the largest deportation of illegal immigrants in American history.' As Homan has stated, 'Of course, there has to be historic deportation.' What would constitute a 'historic deportation'? During Trump’s first term, his administration deported 1.5 million undocumented immigrants. President Biden is on pace to deport the same number by the time he leaves office. Approximately 3 million people were deported during President Barack Obama’s eight years in office. So, for the last 16 years, 'normal' deportations have averaged 375,000 a year. The bulk of those deported were people apprehended after recently crossing the border. Deportations from the U.S. interior have averaged 100,000 annually for the past decade. What would it take to double or triple those numbers? First, there are not enough detention facilities to house millions of immigrants, nor are there enough immigration courts to process their cases for any immediate mass deportation. The American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration advocacy organization, recently estimated that if sufficient detention facilities were constructed and nearly 1,000 immigration courts established, it would take a decade and cost almost $1 trillion to remove the undocumented immigrant population from the United States. Trump says, 'It’s not a question of a price tag. It’s not—really, we have no choice' other than mass deportation. However, the costs of removal are only the tip of the iceberg. There are other costs. For example, Trump has stated that he wants to make housing more affordable and decrease grocery prices. That won’t happen if homebuilders and food producers have to replace the nearly 1.6 million undocumented construction workers (25 percent of the total nationwide) and the tens of thousands of undocumented farm workers (more than 40 percent of the total) they now employ. Any mass deportation would drastically shrink the labor supply in these industries and increase consumer costs. Mass deportations also would undermine Trump’s promise to reinvigorate the economy. The American Immigration Council study estimates that a mass deportation would shrink the U.S. economy—that is, lower the overall gross domestic product—by 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent. A smaller and more targeted deportation seems likely, given the massive costs that counter Trump’s other goals. Homan has stated, 'You’ve got to prioritize where you go first' when choosing who to deport and that 'we’re going to concentrate on the worst of the worst.' According to a recent House Judiciary Committee report, ICE currently has a list of 617,607 non-detained undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime or have pending criminal charges. Presumably, they would constitute the 'worst of the worst.' Trump should concentrate his deportation agenda on this group: immigrants who are here illegally and who have committed serious crimes. Such a program would be logistically feasible, entail lower economic costs, wouldn’t undermine his other policy goals, and could still allow Trump to claim that he’s delivered a 'historic deportation.' Any mass deportation of non-criminal immigrants from the American interior will entail significant economic costs, tear hard-working families apart, and likely create serious public backlash. Trump would be more successful if he focused on deporting only criminals, while securing the border and opening greater paths for legal immigration to help fuel our economy.

Creeping Annexation? Moscow Expands Use Of Border Regions To Incr...	Vladimir Putin has taken another page from Stalin’s playbook and is using the western border regions of the Russian Federation to expand Moscow’s influence in neighboring Belarusian ones, weakening Minsk and raising questions about the Kremlin’s intentions not only with regard to annexing Belarus but using it to attack Ukraine. According to two new reports (rubaltic.ru/article/ekonomika-i-biznes/20241123-regiony-belarusi-i-rossii-uglublyayut-ekonomicheskoe-vzaimodeystvie/ and eurasia.expert/regiony-belarusi-i-rossii-ukreplyayut-gorizontalnye-svyazi/), Moscow has quietly expanded this effort over the last several months. Using border regions to promote larger policy goals has been a long-standing Russian and before that Soviet strategy (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2020/09/russian-governors-playing-increasing.html, windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2019/12/cross-border-trade-means-for-russia-to.html and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2019/06/moscow-expanding-its-influence-in.html). But the situation with regard to such regional cooperation in the Russian-Belarusian case now inevitably raises questions about Moscow’s intentions -- especially in the wake of Putin’s war in Ukraine, one that the Kremlin invoked as a casus belli earlier transfers of what it claims as Russian territories, including Crimea and the Donbass, to Ukraine. That is all the more so because as one Moscow writer has pointed out, 'the most significant land gift from the RSRSR under Stalin' to another republic did not involve transfer of control of territory from Russia to Ukraine but land from Russia to Belarus (russian7.ru/post/kakie-territorii-stalin-prisoedinil/). Between 1924 and 1926, the Soviet government transferred from the RSFSR to Belarus, almost all of Vitebsk, Mogilyev and Gomel oblasts, moves far larger than the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine and that increased the size of the Belarusian SSR by three times (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2018/07/stalin-frequently-modified-russias.html).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazCCbvh2Vx6BW	2024-11-27T16:33:17-08:00	
The Jerusalem Temple And Its Older Brother: The Ka’ba – OpEd	Narrated Abu Dhar: I said, 'O Allah's Messenger, which (Holy Site) mosque was first built on the surface of the earth?' He said, 'Al- Masjid-ul-, Haram (in Mecca).' I said, 'Which was built next?' He replied 'The mosque of Al-Aqsa ( in Jerusalem) .' (Sahih al-Bukhari 3366 In-book reference : Book 60, Hadith 45 USC-MSA web (English) reference : Vol. 4, Book 55, Hadith 585) The Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) and the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca are the two most well-known sites for monotheistic pilgrimage in the world. The Islamic Hajj to the Ka'ba in Makka, and the Jewish Hajj to the Temple in Jerusalem, have been alternate swings of a single sacred pendulum connecting earthly humans to one monotheistic Divine source in the heavens. The Ka'ba was the original site of the Islamic Hajj. Destroyed in the days of Noah, it was later rebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. After several centuries it was desecrated by later generations of idol worshipers. During the centuries while the Ka'ba was desecrated, Prophet Solomon built a Temple in Jerusalem for Jewish Haj on the site where Abraham bound his son Isaac as an offering to God.Four centuries later the Temple of Solomon was destroyed in 587 BCE by the Babylonians. Then the Temple was rebuilt with the support of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, and lasted for almost six centuries. As Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE) states; Jewish pilgrims came to Jerusalem from the ends of the earth, and from all the compass points. But with the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, the pilgrimage Hajj aspect of the week-long harvest festival of Hag Sukkot, began a gradual decline in the spiritual consciousness of the Jewish People. The first time Hag/Hajj is mentioned in the Torah is in that famous scene when Prophets: 'Moses and Aaron told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go into the wilderness, that they may hold a feast (Hag) for me.'' [Exodus 5:1] or better: 'And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a Hajj/pilgrimage feast for me in the wilderness.'' But that one-time Hajj never occurred because Pharaoh refused to free the Jewish People thus incurring Divine wrath. The normative annual two Jewish Hajj week-long pilgrimages were the liberation celebration of Haj Passover; and especially the gratitude celebration of the harvest festival of Haj Sukkot. The Torah declares: 'Celebrate Hajj Sukkot for seven days after you have harvested the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns...Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose: at the Hajj of Matzah (Passover), the Hajj of Weeks, and the Hajj of Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 16:13-16) Hajj Sukkot was so important during the centuries when Solomon's Temple stood that the holy week of Sukkot was often called simply 'the Hajj' because of the very large numbers of Jews who came up to the Temple in Jerusalem. Hajj Passover is also celebrated as a weeklong pilgrimage. The third Hajj of Weeks is similar to Islamic Umrah, the non-mandatory lesser pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca, which may be performed at any time of the year. Although they share common rites, Umrah can be performed in less than a few hours; while Hajj is more time-consuming and involves many more rituals. The third Jewish Hajj of Weeks, like Umrah, is much simpler than Hajj Passover and can be performed in less than a few hours; on any one day during the seven weeks following Hajj Passover. The Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is the largest mosque in the world and it surrounds one of Islam's holiest places, the Ka-ba. Unlike other mosques which are gender segregated, men and women can worship at the Al-Masjid Al-Haram together. The Holy Temple (Beit ha-Mikdash) of Jerusalem had two successive Temples on the Temple Mount where there now stands the Dome of the Rock. The Jerusalem Temple complex was separated into different areas where male priests, men, women and non-Jews could all come to worship the one God. Why is the Ka'ba the older brother of the Jerusalem Temple? Prophet Abraham is connected to both sacred sites. Prophets Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the destroyed Ka'ba; and later, Prophets Abraham and Isaac were tested on the hill where the Jerusalem Temple would someday be built by Prophet Solomon. Since Islam is the last of the Abrahamic religions it is the most universal of them. Since Judaism is the first, and for over twelve centuries the only ongoing monotheistic religion, it is the least universal and the most pluralistic and tribal of the three Abrahamic religions. For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe, and worked continually for a dozen centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Prophet Abraham, the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) was the first, and only prophet, to successfully establish, through the descendants of his own two sons, three ongoing monotheistic religions, that have lasted into the 21st century: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; witch now make up about half of the world's population. Judaism discourages people who are interested in converting to Judaism because Judaism is the only true religion. Indeed, most non-Jews who become Jewish do it to unify a marriage or because they have a Jewish ancestor even if they do not yet know it. Judaism is not a missionary faith and so doesn't actively try to convert non-Jewish people (in many countries anti-Jewish laws prohibited converting to Judaism for centuries). However, the modern Jewish community increasingly welcomes would-be converts. A person who converts to Judaism becomes a Jew and is just as Jewish as someone born into Judaism. As Prophet Micah (4:5) states: 'For all the (other) peoples walk each in the name of its god; and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.' Five hundred years before the birth of Prophet Muhammad Rabbi Yishmael, one of Judaism's most important rabbis was recorded as saying: 'In the future, the sons of Ishmael (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the Land of Israel ... They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple, and construct a building (the Dome of the Rock) on the site of the (ruined by the Romans) sanctuary'. Prophet Zechariah even includes those who were previously Israel's enemies: 'Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem, will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate Hajj Sukkot.' (Zechariah 14:16) There is vacant land on the Temple Mount, and a three dimensional virtual reality broadcast station could be erected adjacent to the Dome of the Rock fulfilling the vision of Prophet Micah (4:1-3) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and (monotheistic) peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. Torah will be broadcast out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' provided that Muslim leaders would cooperate. Just as the Ka'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). When all those, both near and far, who revere this place as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then I will do as Prophet Abraham requested, and 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). Then will all the children of Prophet Abraham live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation-community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazB6KlferGs33	2024-11-27T16:29:08-08:00	
DOGE Could Become A Global Model For Fiscal Reform – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi President-elect Donald Trump has unveiled the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, in a sweeping effort to confront inefficiency and waste in federal operations. This bold initiative aims to identify and eliminate fraudulent practices and mismanagement within federal agencies, ensuring taxpayer dollars are used responsibly and effectively. Leading this ambitious endeavor are two innovation trailblazers: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.The decision to entrust Musk and Ramaswamy with this critical task underscores Trump’s commitment to leveraging visionary leadership to solve entrenched governmental issues. Known for their transformative impact on technology and business, they symbolize a fresh, forward-thinking approach to governance. Under their leadership, DOGE will work to root out inefficiencies systematically, set higher standards for operational performance and establish a culture of fiscal discipline within the federal government.Trump’s announcement comes at a time when the need for reform is more urgent than ever. A March report from the Government Accountability Office revealed that $236 billion was wasted on improper payments last year alone — money that went to ineligible recipients or was misallocated due to systemic failures. This glaring inefficiency is compounded by a ballooning national debt of nearly $36 trillion and the $950 billion spent on interest payments in 2023. These staggering figures illuminate the critical need for decisive action.DOGE fulfills a key promise of Trump’s presidential campaign: to disrupt the bloated federal bureaucracy and deliver savings to American taxpayers. His vision is clear: streamline government operations, ensure accountability and restore trust in federal institutions. By reducing waste, the initiative seeks to redirect resources toward vital programs and investments that directly benefit citizens.The stakes are high. With interest on the national debt projected to grow further, unchecked wasteful spending poses a grave threat to America’s financial health. The new department aims to address these challenges head-on by introducing an era of fiscal responsibility and operational transparency. The initiative also promises to create opportunities for private sector collaboration, drawing on innovative practices to modernize government functions.Musk and Ramaswamy bring unique expertise to this endeavor. Musk’s groundbreaking advancements in technology and sustainability, combined with Ramaswamy’s entrepreneurial insight and efficiency-focused strategies, create a powerful synergy to confront inefficiency on an unprecedented scale. Together, they embody Trump’s vision of a government that mirrors the best practices of the private sector — innovative, efficient and results-driven.In a post on X on Saturday, Ramaswamy highlighted the glaring inefficiencies in government resource management, urging a creative and transformative approach to addressing the issue. He claimed that the federal government spends a staggering $15 billion annually on powering and maintaining office buildings, even though many employees no longer work on-site. He also noted that billions are spent on office furnishings and highlighted the existence of nearly 8,000 vacant government-owned buildings, calling the situation 'nuts' and stating that it might benefit from innovative solutions, potentially inspired by decentralized systems like DOGE.Musk and Ramaswamy have introduced an ambitious plan to reshape and streamline the US federal bureaucracy, emphasizing the need for greater efficiency, accountability and fiscal responsibility. Central to their vision is a strategy to reduce the size and scope of federal operations by addressing long-standing inefficiencies and redirecting resources toward more effective governance.One key aspect is a commitment to end unauthorized federal spending, which they estimate to exceed $500 billion annually. By aligning expenditures with congressional authorizations, they aim to restore fiscal discipline and reduce the burden on taxpayers. This will be complemented by large-scale audits of outdated government contracts to identify and address inefficiencies in procurement processes, yielding substantial savings.In addition to regulatory reform, they propose a significant reduction in the federal workforce. Rather than targeting individual employees, they plan to utilize existing 'reduction in force' authorities, bypassing traditional civil service protections to achieve structural adjustments within federal agencies. This approach is designed to streamline operations while minimizing the complexities of workforce management.Their reform agenda also extends to the Department of Defense, which has failed its audit for the seventh consecutive year despite its annual budget of more than $800 billion. The two businessmen intend to tackle waste and inefficiencies within the department, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are used effectively to support national security.Importantly, these changes are designed to be implemented through existing presidential powers, avoiding the delays and challenges of securing new legislative approvals from Congress. With a target date of July 4, 2026, they aim to complete this overhaul and present a more efficient, transparent and accountable federal government to the American people.As he prepares to take office, the president-elect has positioned the Department of Government Efficiency as a cornerstone of his administration’s agenda for 2025. This initiative reflects a commitment to fiscal discipline and a broader aspiration to reshape the federal government into a model of transparency and accountability. DOGE has the potential to inspire nations worldwide as a transformative model for reducing government spending, curbing dependency on public sector employment and fostering the growth of vibrant private enterprises. By introducing a system that prioritizes efficiency, accountability and innovation, the new department offers a roadmap for countries seeking to address financial instability and unlock their economic potential.At its core, DOGE’s mission to identify and eliminate wasteful government expenditure demonstrates that fiscal responsibility is not only achievable but essential for sustainable governance. For nations struggling under the weight of inefficiency and mounting debts, adopting similar strategies could help restore financial stability, freeing up resources to invest in areas that directly benefit citizens.Excessive reliance on government jobs often leads to bloated bureaucracies, inefficiency and limited opportunities for individual growth. Countries can foster innovation, entrepreneurship and job creation by shifting their focus toward private sector empowerment. This transition reduces the strain on public finances and establishes a foundation for a more dynamic and self-reliant economy.

Jamaica And The Failure Of The Entrepreneurial State – OpEd	By Lipton Matthews The concept of the entrepreneurial state proposes that governments—like private enterprises—can take risks, innovate, and drive economic growth. Through direct intervention, governments can strategically invest in sectors that hold promise for the future, aiming to spark productivity and economic expansion. However, in countries like Jamaica, the limitations of the entrepreneurial state are evident, as interventions often face economic realities and public sentiment that clash with the expectations of the private sector. Jamaica’s challenges with state-owned enterprises, regulatory bodies, and education policy reveal that government-led initiatives can only rearrange and stifle, rather than stimulate, economic potential. One example of how Jamaica and regional governments grapple with their role as an 'entrepreneurial' state is the continued support for subjects within the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) curriculum, which has seen low student enrollment. Subjects like Agricultural Science and Green Engineering are crucial in addressing Jamaica’s long-term developmental needs, including sustainable agriculture and environmental resilience. Nevertheless, these courses remain unpopular, with a small proportion of students opting to study them, which raises questions about the efficient allocation of resources. While an entrepreneurial company would likely cut these programs due to low demand, the CXC opted to retain them after facing public backlash, reflecting the influence of societal expectations on government decisions. In this case, the government is caught between responding to educational trends and fulfilling a broader societal mission to promote learning areas that might benefit the national economy over the long term. Yet, from an entrepreneurial perspective, continuing to fund these subjects indicates a misallocation of resources. Maintaining courses that lack student demand is arguably not a cost-effective investment and diverges from the private sector’s focus on high-demand offerings that drive profitability. Additionally, students have the option of studying these courses at the university so discontinuing them at the high school level won’t necessarily affect economic plans. The failure to offer subjects at the secondary level has never prevented students from pursuing them at university. Similarly, Jamaica’s public transportation sector offers another view into the challenges of state-led enterprise. The JamaicaUrban Transit Corporation (JUTC) has been financially unviable for years, heavily reliant on government subsidies to operate. A private company facing such persistent losses would likely have ceased operations or restructured to prioritize profitability. But rather than divesting the company, the government has decided to compound problems by expanding its services into rural areas. Rural regions often have poor infrastructure, which increases operational costs. In addition, rural demand may not be high enough to offset these expenses, particularly under the current fare structure, where prices are kept low to remain accessible to all. In this scenario, government funding would likely be stretched thinner, requiring substantial subsidies to cover the additional operational costs associated with maintaining rural routes. While the government’s continued support of the JUTC serves a social purpose, it raises questions about the sustainability of using taxpayer money to support a loss-making enterprise indefinitely. Moreover, the Jamaican government’s plan to revitalize the railway system, despite its troubled financial history, underscores the limitations of state-led entrepreneurship. Rail infrastructure is undeniably valuable for economic and environmental reasons, potentially reducing road congestion and emissions. However, without a viable business model, the revitalization could merely extend a legacy of losses. In this sense, the state’s involvement is a gamble that could further drain public resources, highlighting the delicate balance between serving public needs and securing a return on investment. The role of regulatory bodies in the agricultural sector further illustrate the restrictive influence that state intervention can have on Jamaica’s economy. The Jamaica Agricultural Commodities Regulatory Association (JACRA) was established to oversee the production and export of key crops, but its influence has stifled innovation and competition in the agricultural sector. By setting prices below the market rate for certain products, JACRA inadvertently limits farmers’ potential earnings, discouraging expansion, and reducing incentives for quality improvement. A private company, in contrast, would operate with a primary focus on optimizing profitability and encouraging growth. For example, a private agricultural association might explore more lucrative export opportunities, market Jamaican crops internationally, or invest in research and development for sustainable farming practices. Invariably, JACRA’s approach reflects a cautious regulatory stance that prioritizes market stability, arguably at the cost of stifling the sector’s dynamism and growth potential. These examples reflect the inherent tensions in the concept of a so-called entrepreneurial state. While Jamaica’s government has intervened across various sectors to promote social welfare, economic stability, and infrastructure, these actions clash with the principles of entrepreneurialism, such as risk-taking, flexibility, and resource optimization. Any entrepreneurial entity must be willing to operate with economic efficiency and responsiveness to economic signals. However, when it comes to the 'entrepreneurial state,' however, public opinion, historical legacies, and social missions often weigh heavily on government decision-making, leading to compromises that an entrepreneurial organization would avoid. Ultimately, the Jamaican government’s continued support for financially unsustainable initiatives like the JUTC, or the decision to retain low-enrollment educational programs, reveal the complex motivations behind state intervention. While the entrepreneurial state theory holds that governments can lead innovation and economic development, in practice, Jamaica’s experience highlights the limits of this model in a context where economic realities and public expectations often diverge from private sector principles.

Fear Is Still The Motivation For Black Voters – OpEd	Kamala Harris is now a historical footnote who is heading for the dustbin of history. Yet this harsh truth is avoided by many Black people, who cast aspersions and scorn when they should see the election result as an opportunity to forge a new political reality, instead of clinging to a party that has lost legitimacy with many of its voters. 'More directly, the Black electoral imperative to seek protection from the Republican/White Man’s Party reduces African Americans to an appendage of the Democratic Party apparatus, and thus of the capitalists that fund and control the Party. It subverts the essentially progressive nature of the Black polity, objectively enfeebling Black America, even as rich white Democrats pander to Black voters as the 'soul' of the party.'Glen Ford The always prescient Glen Ford wrote those words in February 2016 as he correctly hypothesized that Black voters would continue their tradition of supporting the candidate they believed was most likely to defeat a republican in that presidential election year. Eight years later his words still ring true. Donald Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris has engendered anger, fear, and retrograde politics, but surprisingly little criticism of the Democratic Party which failed its most loyal voters so spectacularly. The Kamala Harris/Tim Walz campaign raised more than $1.5 billion , more than the Donald Trump/J.D. Vance campaign was able to raise. Harris had the support of Democratic Party donors, corporate media, and the entire liberal class establishment yet received 7 million fewer votes than Joe Biden did in his 2020 race against Trump. Trump received 2.5 million more votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. The reaction of many Black voters was epitomized by MSNBC commentator Eddie Glaude , who insists that Trump only gets votes from people who feel their 'whiteness' is under threat and dismisses the idea that there is any other explanation for Trump’s victory. One can never underestimate the power of racist and supremacist feelings among white people in this country, but that sentiment is not only simplistic in political terms but ignores the flaws in the Harris campaign and in Harris herself. But any such analysis seems to be off limits to millions of Black people, who are capable of navigating many other contradictions in their lives but who demur whenever there is a need to honestly address the party which would never win presidential elections without them. The notion of choice, even the choice of how to think or express oneself has been declared off limits. There is not nearly h dismay and anger that the party with resources to do anything it wanted still could not make enough of a case to win. There is precious little curiosity about the wisdom of making a top down choice after the donors’ coup against Biden’s re-election campaign. There is a suspension of disbelief from otherwise intelligent people who claim not to notice the famous Harris 'word salads' and odd pronouncements about coconut trees. There is an unwillingness to understand that people who depended on the covid era stimulus payments, child tax credits, and expansions of SNAP and medicaid benefits would not bother to vote for the democratic candidate who served with the president claiming to be the 'most progressive president since FDR' but who stood down when these programs ended.The trancelike state of much of Black America is a result of a deep fear of republican control of government, particularly if Trump is the republican in question. The fog is so heavy that it blocks out logic, empathy and even the need for self-preservation. It should be clear to anyone that a candidate who can raise more than $1 billion is automatically compromised. Having buy-in from the wealthy means that any message that might motivate voters will be off the table. The obedience to the oligarchic class that doomed the Build Back Better legislation is now permanent for the party and unfortunately for its voters as well. The spending spree didn’t even help Black democrats much. The Harris campaign paid $350,000 to Nu Vision Media, which is run by hack propagandist Roland Martin, before Martin’s softball interview with her. The money was not well spent, as Martin is only capable of reaching the choir Harris already preached to. Similarly, Al Sharpton’s National Action Network was also the recipient of useless largesse to the broader community when it received two payments of $250,000 each before the good reverend also held a very friendly interview with Harris. When the payments were revealed, Martin’s only comment was that 'It should have been a hell of a lot more. More should have been spent on Black-owned media.' While Black people clung to the hope of a Harris victory, the grifters saw the campaign as just another opportunity for a chump change payday. Well connected party consultants got rich, some of them making millions of dollars as they do every four years. Despite the resounding defeat, this columnist noticed a stubborn unwillingness to even question Harris’ campaign strategy. Her website was devoid of policy statements for 50 days, she chose to pursue non-existent 'never Trump' republicans, and she was unable to explain how she would differ from Biden or Trump even when speaking to friendly interviewers. Loyal Black democrats have rendered these and other critiques as being off limits for discussion or even of thought. The people who were once so organized that their actions changed U.S. politics and whose activism created programs like medicare and medicaid, now see themselves as powerless supplicants who can only support whomever the system spits out for consideration. Having decided to narrow their analysis only to how racist and misogynistic white voters are, there is no room to confront their predicament of Democratic Party loyalty. Lamentation about Trump 2.0 supersedes critical thought or discussion of options or how to change the Black relationship to the Democratic Party which has now been brought to such a low point. Money and the Black misleadership class are the main culprits in the continuation of this perverse relationship. The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and the civil rights organizations are bought off. Like Martin and Sharpton they are brought out every four years to prevent any hard questions from breaking out and to be paid off for their meager efforts. The hapless and hollow Harris has now been raised to a strange demi-goddess status. Her spectacular failure goes unexamined and so does any discussion of a new politics for Black people to seek. Even rudimentary questions about making demands or even asking questions are dismissed in favor of anger directed at Trump voters. There are certainly reasons for anger but they should not be directed at Trump supporters and non-voters. All blame should be placed squarely on the shoulders of the democrats. Black people need a new political vision, one that does not depend solely on electoral politics at four year intervals. Black people have achieved many great things but that won’t happen again if there is no willingness for introspection and for denunciation of the people who have driven them over a political cliff yet again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdgMryrGLYazAI0gf0kh05K	2024-11-27T16:12:35-08:00	
Provoking Nuclear War Over Something Americans Do Not See As A Ma...	New polling conducted this month by the Pew Research Center indicates that only 30 percent of Americans believe that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a 'major threat to U.S. interests.' That perception was at its highest of 50 percent of Americans shortly after the invasion. It has in successive polling consistently come in much lower, until reaching this new low. Nevertheless, the United States government over the past nearly three years has kept ramping up its support for Ukraine’s ongoing war with Russia — including via money, intelligence, and weapons. So involved in the war has the US become that it is seems a stretch to claim that the US is not at war directly with Russia. Thus we reach the point where nuclear war between the US and Russia has become a possible outgrowth of the ongoing conflict. When Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, 2022, US President Joe Biden rushed to present a speech to stir up public support for the US government helping Ukraine and punishing Russia. He presented the US as acting to advance democracy in these endeavors. However, even at the height of stirred up war fever, an American majority did not see Russia’s action as a major threat to US interests. Now, that view is held by less than a third of Americans. Yet, the US government remains relentless in its war effort. In reality, it is all about power to the politicians, not power to the people. Biden’s appeal to democracy was intended to stir up an overwhelming support among Americans for the US going all in on aiding Ukraine and harming Russia. He largely failed in the effort. Democracy in America has said 'no' to war. Nonetheless, Biden, along with many other politicians, have continued pursuing war anyway. And now it seems they may keep doing so to the point of nuclear annihilation.

Silent Apartheid: The Rising Plight Of Lower Castes In Modi’s Ind...	Caste, an ancient social construct often dismissed as a relic of India’s past, remains a harsh reality for millions in the country. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, caste-based oppression has not only persisted but appears to be intensifying, exposing the dark underbelly of a society that prides itself on progress and modernity. As India embraces an increasingly radicalized nationalism, the plight of its lower castes, particularly Dalits, has worsened, revealing a systematic erosion of justice, equality, and human dignity. The rhetoric of development and empowerment that dominates India’s political discourse masks the grim realities faced by its marginalized communities. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) increased by over 9% in 2022 compared to the previous year, with heinous acts of rape, murder, and physical violence disproportionately targeting Dalits. The deeply entrenched caste hierarchy, embedded in every aspect of Indian society, continues to thrive under the veneer of modernity, aided by the state’s reluctance to challenge the status quo. The erosion of India’s secular foundation has been a gradual but deliberate process. Since Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assumed power in 2014, the nation has seen a pronounced shift towards 'saffronization', a political project that prioritizes Hindu identity and culture, often at the expense of marginalized groups. While Hindu nationalism seeks to unite the majority population under a singular identity, this unification inherently sidelines communities that challenge the dominant narrative, including Dalits, Muslims, and other minorities. This saffronized vision of India does not merely marginalize lower castes, it actively dehumanizes them. Textbooks in BJP-governed states, for instance, have been revised to glorify upper-caste heroes while erasing the contributions and struggles of Dalit leaders like B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of India’s Constitution. Similarly, caste atrocities are frequently dismissed or downplayed, with political leaders and officials often defending upper-caste perpetrators. Such actions signal to society that lower castes are expendable and that violence against them can occur with near-total impunity. The international community has taken notice of the deteriorating conditions for India’s lower castes. The 2020 Hathras case, where a young Dalit woman was gang-raped and murdered in Uttar Pradesh, sparked global outrage, with human rights organizations condemning the state’s mishandling of the case. Similarly, the public lynching of a Dalit man in Rajasthan in 2021, allegedly for entering a temple, was widely criticized as emblematic of India’s caste apartheid. International institutions have not remained silent either. The United Nations has repeatedly urged India to address caste-based violence, linking it to broader systemic inequalities. In 2021, the UN’s Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Indian government to implement stringent measures against caste discrimination. However, despite this global scrutiny, domestic action remains tepid at best, as caste hierarchies are too deeply entrenched to be uprooted without systemic reform. To comprehend the persistence of caste oppression, Antonio Gramsci’s theory of cultural hegemony provides a useful lens. Gramsci argued that societal dominance is not merely enforced through coercion but also through the normalization of certain values and beliefs by the ruling class. In India, upper-caste norms have long been institutionalized as the cultural default, allowing caste-based discrimination to thrive unchecked. The BJP’s cultural hegemony builds on this foundation by amplifying Hindu upper-caste ideals as synonymous with Indian identity. In doing so, it marginalizes Dalit narratives and perpetuates a system where lower castes remain 'invisible' or are reduced to stereotypes. This hegemony extends to policy-making, media representation, and even the digital economy, creating a society where caste discrimination is normalized rather than challenged. Caste discrimination is not confined to acts of physical violence; it is also deeply ingrained in India’s economic structure. Despite affirmative action policies like reservations in education and government jobs, Dalits remain disproportionately excluded from economic opportunities. A 2023 report by the Centre for Social Justice found that nearly 45% of Dalits live below the poverty line, compared to a national average of 22%. The rise of the gig economy and digital platforms has only widened this gap. Studies indicate that Dalits face systemic discrimination in hiring practices and are overrepresented in low-paying, menial jobs. In rural areas, where caste hierarchies are more rigid, Dalits are frequently denied access to land, credit, and other resources, perpetuating cycles of poverty and dependence. India’s caste crisis is a moral failure that demands urgent redress. For the nation to uphold its democratic principles, it must dismantle the structural inequalities that bind millions of its citizens to perpetual subjugation. This requires not only legal reform but also a cultural shift that challenges the normalization of caste-based oppression. However, such transformation seems unlikely under the current regime, which appears more invested in consolidating majoritarian power than in addressing systemic injustices. As India inches further toward authoritarianism, the voices of its marginalized communities risk being silenced altogether. The plight of India’s lower castes is not just an internal issue; it is a global concern. As the world’s largest democracy, India has a responsibility to lead by example, ensuring justice and equality for all its citizens. Anything less is a betrayal of its founding ideals and a stark reminder that progress without equity is no progress at all.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWlYmfIdvZLUHVzdL_0VhC	2024-11-27T16:07:49-08:00	
Biden Officials Edging Toward Nuclear Reckoning Over Ukraine – Op...	By Dave Patterson Inside the Biden White House, after more than 1,000 days of brutal conflict in Ukraine, officials at some level are considering a new strategy. It appears the 'as-long-it-takes' approach is taking too long, and President-elect Donald Trump’s national security team is readying to take over. It seems Joe Biden’s coterie of official geopolitical thinkers is floating the notion of providing nuclear weapons to Ukraine. Biden Officials Offer Unthinkable Solution These conversations were a reaction to what current members of NATO and Biden’s national security team anticipate is Trump’s intention to secure a negotiated peace in Ukraine. The question on the table is if peace in Ukraine is predicated on an agreed-to ceasefire, how is the ceasefire guaranteed? One answer was posited in an Off the Press post that referred to a New York Times article, 'Trump’s Vow to End the War Could Leave Ukraine With Few Options': 'So, US and European officials are discussing deterrence as a possible security guarantee for Ukraine, such as stockpiling a conventional arsenal sufficient to strike a punishing blow if Russia violates a ceasefire. Several officials even suggested that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union. That would be an instant and enormous deterrent. But such a step would be complicated and have serious implications.' These are the kinds of conversations that go on when there are no adults in the room. The concept of returning nuclear weapons suggests that, as a member of the former Warsaw Bloc countries, Ukraine had autonomy in the employment of atomic warheads. In fact, these were Soviet Union-era weapons that belonged to and were under the command and control of the Kremlin, or so it was thought. New evidence, however, suggests Ukraine had more control over the use of the weapons than originally believed. 'These records cut sharply against the rationale for this historical resignation: that Ukraine was incapable of the technical means of operating nuclear weapons and that such weapons wouldn’t do much for its security even if it could,' The National Interest reported. Ukraine was sacrificing its security in the interest of international guarantees. Nonetheless, those weapons were removed from Ukraine in 1994 in compliance with the Security Assurances in Connection With Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Countries that signed the treaty, also called the Budapest Memorandum, were the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, the United States, and Northern Ireland. The memorandum effectively declared that if Kyiv gave up the nuclear weapons stored in Ukraine, the signatories of the non-proliferation agreement would 'refrain from threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.' Well, obviously, the Russian Federation violated the treaty. Moscow has a long history of engaging in such violations. What Will Putin Do? The lunacy of threatening to introduce modern nuclear weapons, which is what they would be, presumably since bringing back the original weapons is not possible, is mind-boggling. Who would have command and control over these weapons? With a ceasefire violation by Russia, wouldn’t Ukraine be more likely to resort to using the nuclear weapons if it could? And if operational control of the weapons remained with the United States or some other nuclear NATO nation, by whose authority would they be used? The lack of will displayed by the United States and NATO so far indicates the weapons would not be employed. So where is the deterrence value? Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use the Kremlin’s tactical nuclear arsenal based on a reduced threshold, and now NATO and US national security officials believe he will back down and be deterred if Ukraine once again is a nuclear nation. This comes from Biden officials whose constant mantra has been, 'Don’t do anything that would escalate the conflict.' When the United States provided longer range capability for Kyiv to strike targets deeper inside Russia, Putin reacted strongly. 'Putin has warned, even before releasing the revised nuclear doctrine, that the use of long-range missiles supplied by the West to attack Russia would constitute war,' Liberty Nation Newsreported. Imagine Moscow’s reaction even if the return of nuclear weapons to Ukraine were under the guise of ensuring a ceasefire. Did anyone actually think through musing about the deterrent effect of returning nuclear warheads to Ukraine? The United States and select NATO countries have nuclear-capable weapons in Europe. Installing some in Ukraine would be unnecessary atomic belt and suspenders. Trump is going to have enough on his plate negotiating an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine without unnamed US officials sitting around spit-balling about deploying nukes to Ukraine. Such thinking is dangerous and the act of desperation by an administration in the death throes of a failed foreign policy. Worse yet, Putin might consider such notions to be authentic US and NATO planning and use such ravings as a pretext for reacting in a dangerous manner. Did anyone on the Biden team even consider this catastrophic possibility? The views expressed are those of the author and not of any other affiliate.

The Evil That America Does Lives After It – OpEd	By Jonathan Power American foreign policy makers often wonder aloud why it is that much of the world has such an anti-American reflex. Why the 'Ugly American'? Graham Greene would never have written a novel entitled the 'Ugly Russian' or even the 'Ugly German'. It is not just Iran that considers the US as the 'Great Satan'. Remember that day at the UN General Assembly when the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, accused President George W. Bush of belching sulphureous fumes, and most of the chamber chuckled. When the Russian government denies that they switched their publicly announced mission of deploying planes to Syria to fight ISIS and have instead concentrated on bombing the redoubts of groups engaged in the civil war against the government of President Bashar al-Assad a majority of the world’s governments seemingly accepts the denial, despite the contrary evidence. When the US bombs a hospital in Afghanistan killing many staff members of 'Doctors Without Borders' this confirms the opinion of those who are always convinced that America does things like this on purpose after careful planning and will do it again as soon as the opportunity offers itself. There are two reasons, I think, for the image of the Ugly American. The first is America’s standing as the world’s number one economic and military power. The second is the CIA, the notorious Central Intelligence Agency. The British have their MI6 and its special agent, the glamorous James Bond. But the CIA only has its reputation as the master of the black arts of corruption, torture and assassination. The US’s largest covert operation in the CIA’s history Tragically for America its bad reputation is largely deserved. There are some notorious examples of its malfeasance that every politically educated non-American knows about. The most recent were the waterboarding and other torture methods carried out by the CIA during the administration of President George W. Bush. The Congo and its goings on immediately after its independence from Belgium is rightly the stuff of legend, novels, history and film. On 30 June 1960 its young leftist firebrand, Patrice Lumumba, was sworn in as prime minister. Within days the army mutinied against their all-white officer corps. Belgium responded by sending troops to reoccupy the country. Its richest province, the mineral rich Katatanga, was encouraged to secede. Lumumba appealed to the Soviet Union which immediately flew in transport planes. That’s when the Eisenhower administration sent in the CIA. It ranked as the US’s largest covert operation in the CIA’s history. Its station chief, Lawrence Devlin, became so powerful that he controlled many of the key political players in the country. The CIA plotted to have Lumumba deposed, even murdered if necessary. The CIA encouraged President Joseph Kasavubu to turn against Lumumba. He fired the prime minister. Devlin was quick to find a substitute—Mobutu Sese Sese, the 29-year-old army chief of staff. Devlin told his CIA bosses, according to an official US government study, that 'this was the beginning of the plan for Mobutu to take over the government'. Ten weeks after independence Mobutu announced he was suspending parliament and the constitution. Mobutu became the CIA-funded de-facto dictator, with Devlin as his chief counsellor. The two of them agreed that Lumumba must be arrested, and they sent him to Katanga, the Belgium-supported secessionist province, whose government had repeatedly called for his scalp. Within days of his arrival he was shot dead, as the CIA wanted. The CIA then masterminded Cyril Adoula to be a nominal prime minister under Mobutu’s thumb. The CIA bribed parliamentarians, labour unions and the organization of tribal chiefs to back Adoula. The seesawing in Congolese politics continued for another five years before Mobutu, with CIA help, became the paramount leader with no need for a façade of parliamentary rule. For 32 years Mobutu, always considered a close friend by the US, milked the economy for his own financial benefit. The country ended up as the basket case of Africa, more riddled by continuous warfare, corruption and poverty than any other African country. Finally in 1997 rebels headed by a former Lumumbist and backed by military forces from Uganda, Rwanda and Angola deposed Mobutu, leading to a regional war that would kill more than three and half million people over the next decade. Only in the last handful of years has Congo, with massive UN help, begun to right itself. Another case of the perfidy of the CIA I have told at length in my book, 'Like Water On Stone', (Penguin, 2001). It’s the story of the overthrow of the legitimately elected leftist government of Chile in 1973. Other countries do similar bad things as the Americans—the British in Kenya, the Russians in Ethiopia but the world forgets and even forgives. But not with America. To take a liberty with Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, 'The evil that America does lives after it. The good is oft interred with its bones'.

The ‘Let It Rip’ Canard: Reflections On Jay Bhattacharya – OpEd	Early in the Covid period, the skeptics of government closures and universal quarantines were denounced as favoring a policy of 'let it rip.' The phrase has been in use since the 19th century. It is apparently drawn from experience with steamships. When you released power to its maximum extent, it made a ripping sound. The implication is that when you let it rip, you let go of all controls and just wait to see what happens. Think about the application to infectious disease, at least in the context of the debate over lockdowns. The theory is that if you don’t force people to stay home, force businesses to close, and force schools and churches to shut down, people will mindlessly move about here and there and cause infection to spread wildly. No one will have a clue about what to do about it. The implication is that people are unbearably stupid, lack all personal incentive to protect themselves, and somehow cannot but be as reckless as possible. There will be no strategies, no methods of mitigation, no therapeutics, no limits on the spread of incurable sickness. We need geniuses like Anthony Fauci to give us police-enforced guidance in order to stay safe from the consequences of our own choices. We don’t have brains. We don’t have habits born of experience. We don’t have any social mechanisms embedded in our traditions. We don’t have anything. We are worse than an anthill, which at least has a rules-based order born of instinct. In this view, human behavior is purely randomized and rote, moving about here and there, fully unable to process information about guidance, lacking completely in any capacity to be careful, wise, or otherwise govern ourselves. This is the essence of the push for lockdowns. Anything less than totalitarian control of the human population amounts to utter chaos in which the virus rules us all whereas the geniuses at the controls of government power know all things. This is the essential worldview of all those who said that lockdown opponents merely want to let the virus rip. This was of course the core criticism of the Great Barrington Declaration of which NIH Director-nominee Jay Bhattacharya was the main author. It advocated no such thing as 'let it rip.' Instead, it called for public health to recognize the existence of human intelligence and consider the costs of overriding it with police-state edicts that ruin businesses and lives. It came out six months after lockdowns began and already revealed themselves to be devastating. There should not have been anything even slightly controversial about the statement. And yet truly there was something about those times that tempted intellectuals toward grave extremes of utopian thinking. Remember the 'Zero Covid' movement? Talk about insane. I just read an outrageous paper in Frontiers of Health (date March 2021!) that claimed to have the magical solution to Covid. The plan would defeat the disease in 'one day' by ordering simultaneous universal testing, forcing all positive tests to isolate, and monitoring all public spaces with concentration camp guards. The authors proposed this seriously, forgetting that a respiratory virus with a zoonotic reservoir cares nothing for such antics. To have signed one’s name to such a suggestion should confine one to a lifetime of ill repute as an intellectual. There is also the slight problem of human rights and freedom. But, hey, anyone who yammered on about those topics was then accused of being an advocate of 'let it rip.' The truth is that we do have intelligence and brains. Older people have always known to avoid large crowds in flu season. Pick up any geriatric magazine and you can discover that this is true. Even our habits of the season reflect that. Intergenerational family units tend to stay indoors as we enter winter months and get out and about in the spring when threats of infectious disease die down. 'Focused protection' is embedded in the habits of the calendar year. We are also capable of reading data on risk demographics. We knew from February 2020 that Covid posed a medically significant risk mainly to the aged and infirm. There was never a serious risk associated with beach parties or schooling. We knew this at least intuitively, and vast numbers of people also knew to disregard the crazy fear-mongering from the top that was designed to prepare the population for the shot. Society knew better than its managers. It is this way in every sector of life in a world in which society is trusted as the primary manager of itself. It’s true in economics. Now that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are pushing for radical deregulation of all things, the same critique is being offered. They merely advocate that enterprise 'let it rip.' It’s the new name for laissez-faire, another smear term from the 19th century. But in the same sense that people have the intelligence to judge disease risk, society generates systems and institutions that put limits and guardrails up for enterprise too. The existence of rivalrous competition with easy entry and exit keeps prices, profits, and costs toward an equilibrium. Producer accountability is instilled with user ratings, reputation, and strict liability (unless you are a vaccine maker enjoying full indemnification). People forget that the best institutions assuring quality and safety are not government agencies but private services like Underwriters Laboratory, which has been around since the 19th century, long before the federal government had a single agency regulating even food quality. Remove the regulations, abolish the agencies, and competent and well-run private institutions would appear in every area, the same as professional credentialing now. Trusting people to manage infectious disease based on realistic risk assessments is no different from trusting property owners, workers, prices, and markets to work out the best possible solutions to the problem of scarcity in the material world. It doesn’t mean full throttle come what may any more than not locking down means zero control over our health. In other words, this whole phrase has been deployed against the idea of freedom itself. In fact, the proponents of lockdowns were not opposed to smearing that word too, spelling it as freedumb. Early on in the pandemic response, I was interviewed in Germany and the person asked what the best rhetorical strategy would be to push for a reopening. I suggested they campaign for freedom. The response: that is not possible because the word itself has been discredited. My response: if freedom is discredited, we have no cause of hope at all. The legacy of Jay Bhattarcharya’s actions during Covid – joining what felt like a half-dozen of us immediate critics of these awful policies – is not only his attention to science and facts; it is also a reverence for the idea of freedom itself, which really means to trust that society can manage itself with the best-possible outcomes apart from the dictates of pretentious and powerful people at the top. In a beautiful irony, Jay now inherits the position of the man who called him a 'fringe epidemiologist' and called for the censors to do a 'quick and devastating takedown' of his work. It’s been a very long journey lasting nearly five years, but here we are, the man who led the opposition to the worst-imaginable public health policies now in a position to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. Savor this moment: it’s a rare one when justice prevails. As for accountability and the truth about what happened in those dark days, there is a good phrase for what should happen to the information flows that should now happen: let it rip.

A New Arms Race In Europe: Euromissiles 2.0 – Analysis	By Aaron Stein (FPRI) -- Last week, Russia simulated a nuclear strike in Europe with a purpose-built missile designed to carry multiple nuclear or conventional warheads. The missile, which Russia has dubbed ‘Oreshnik’, is the latest Russian missile designed to strike targets in Europe. The missile is a purported variant of the RS-26, which was built using the first stage booster from the RS-24, a road-mobile missile designed to strike targets in the United States. The RS-26 was never deployed when first tested in 2011. However, the missile’s use in combat is clearly now intended to signal to Europe that Russia has a credible delivery system for intermediate-range nuclear strikes. This is part of an effort to make Russia’s nuclear threats more credible and forebodes continued tensions in Europe. The backdrop to these developments is the collapse of Russo-Western relations. This downturn stems from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has destabilized Europe and forced European countries to prepare once again for the prospect of regional conflict. These tensions have had a clear impact on missile proliferation in the region. The roots of missile proliferation date back to the turn of the 21st century, the gradual demise of the arms control agreements, and the upending of European security following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The use of the Oreshnik/RS-26 is, I believe, intended to influence decision-making in European capitals about the future of European-Russian relations. This is a classic Russian strategy and broadly reminiscent of Moscow’s thinking about the deployment and development of the SS-20 missile. I believe that this approach to intra-European relations will fail and, along with the United States, Europe is destined for the vast expansion of conventionally armed, medium-range missiles, designed to strike with extreme accuracy. This development forebodes continued instability in Europe, a future where arms control will be far more difficult than ever before to use to lessen tensions and suggests that the arms build-up that is now taking place will continue well into the future. A SS-20 Clone: Renewed Capabilities and Faulty Assumptions The RS-26 has its roots in the Cold War. It is the successor to the SS-20, the ballistic missile the Soviet Union developed to get around limits it agreed to in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). The missile was tested using three stages, but then packed full of warheads, and then cut down to hold airbases in Europe at risk. The development and deployment of the SS-20 presented Washington and the NATO alliance with a strategic and political problem: the missile could carry multiple nuclear warheads and fire at Europe from well within the territorial boundaries of the Soviet Union. This meant that Soviet Union no longer had to deploy missiles in the Warsaw Pact countries, where they were far closer to NATO forces, and therefore more vulnerable to attack. The United States and NATO had no corresponding system, which led to the second major issue: the Soviet Union could strike NATO territory with nuclear weapons with a purpose-built delivery system, while simultaneously threatening to hit U.S. targets with longer range missiles. This created a dilemma for NATO: Russia could strike targets in Europe without using weapons slated for striking the United States. This meant that in the event of a limited nuclear war in Europe a U.S. leader would be forced to risk a Soviet nuclear counter-strike to respond to an attack in an allied third country. The goal was to undermine confidence in U.S. security guarantees to undercut NATO – and it was done with one country in mind: West Germany. Russia’s goal was to make the defense of Germany untenable, thereby incentivizing West German leaders to be neutral by emphasizing their economic and security incentive to cooperate more closely with East Germany. This approach was broadly in synch with the intra-West German tensions about how to manage relations with their communist neighbors; whether to combat East German communists or cooperate with them. In the end, the deployment of the SS-20 did not break NATO or force German neutrality. Instead, West Germany (and all of NATO) agreed to host two comparable systems: the Gryphon (a ground launched version of the ubiquitous Tomahawk cruise missile) and the Pershing-II (a very accurate, multiple nuclear warhead carrying ballistic missile). These U.S. made systems, along with the SS-20, were what the two sides agreed to give up when Premier Gorbachev and President Reagan signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987. Euromissiles 2.0 The demise of the INF is multifaceted and largely Russia’s fault. However, the United States did undercut an absolutely critical component of all arms control with Russia. In 2002, the Bush administration withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which placed strict limits on the deployment of missile defense systems. The basic principle that underpinned this treaty was that neither side should seek to build its way out of vulnerability from strategic missile attack. The basic idea that neither side could 'win' a nuclear war allowed for mutual arms reduction. This is also the most basic component of deterrence theory; deterrence works because the mutual threat of catastrophic destruction prevents the use of nuclear weapons, thereby creating a positive incentive to refrain from launching a first strike. A capable anti-missile system could, in theory, undercut the feeling of vulnerability, which would naturally then require building more missiles to overwhelm defenses to offset any defensive advantages. This build-up would then require more weapons, which would be impossible under various treaty constraints that the two sides had agreed to during the Cold War. The demise of the ABM Treaty is one of many reasons for Russia’s decision to use legal language to circumvent the INF Treaty. The RS-26 was one such example. Moscow did what it did with the SS-20, it tested the RS-26 out to intercontinental range, removed a small third stage, and then packed the cut down missile with warheads. The excess weight decreased the missile’s range, thereby giving Russia an intermediate-range, nuclear capable delivery vehicle to strike targets in Europe. Moscow’s development of this system is often defined as a circumvention of the INF’s limits because it technically tested the missile to a range allowed under a different treaty agreement: New Start. The reasons for this require an entirely different piece, but needless to say, the development of the RS-26 was – and remains – a Russian effort to use known loopholes in two agreements – the INF and New Start – to build an intermediate-range missile capability. Russia also chose to violate the INF outright – and it was this violation that led the United States to withdraw from INF in 2019. This more concrete violation came when Russia developed of a land-based Kalibr cruise missile, known as the 9M729 'screwdriver', which has a range in excess of the INF’s limits. The deadlock over this missile ultimately led President Trump to withdraw from the INF, which has since spurned U.S. developments of intermediate-range missiles for deployments in both Asia and Europe. The first of these American-made systems is the Typhon. The Typhon missile launch system is designed to launch two-intermediate-range missiles: the SM-6 ballistic missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile. The Typhon has been deployed in the Philippines and was sent to Denmark for a training exercise. The system is conventionally armed and is slated for deployment on a rotational basis in Germany starting in 2026. The announcement of this deployment agreement in 2024 is one of the myriad of reasons cite by Putin for following through on the Oreshnik/RS-26’s development, deployment, and now use in combat in Ukraine. The dynamics in Europe are very suggestive. The continent is at the start of a medium-range missile build up, led first by the Russian decisions about the INF, followed by the U.S. response to Russia’s missile development, and now by the tensions over Ukraine. These dynamics are very reminiscent of the late 1970s, following the Soviet development of the SS-20 and NATO’s decision to deploy U.S. systems in Germany. The difference this time around is twofold. First, the U.S. and European systems now under development are strictly conventionally armed. However, a second Trump administration may revisit warhead options for the Tomahawk missile, which could open the door for a nuclear armed cruise missile variant. The RS-26, in contrast, appears to have been designed for a nuclear role. However, the variant used to strike Ukraine was obviously carrying a conventional payload, which suggests that Russia may deploy a certain number of Oreshnik/RS-26 missiles with a conventional only payload. Second, the situation in Europe has changed considerably since 1987. The United States and Russia no longer have a near monopoly on missile development and manufacturing. European and Asian missile makers now have the capabilities to build comparable systems to the missiles now spreading throughout Europe. The European missile maker, MBDA, for example, is developing a 'deep strike' cruise and anti-ship missile that will replicate Tomahawk and 9M729 capabilities for probable deployment in Western Europe first, with the option to sell to Eastern European countries. South Korea makes a series of ballistic missiles and is working with Poland on long range artillery rockets, similar in design to the American ATACMS now being used by the Ukrainians. France and the United Kingdom make the very capable Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile, which could very easily be modified for carrying on trucks. The proliferation of these systems, this time around, means that the leverage of both the United States and Russia will be far more limited in constraining missile deployments in the near future. Put simply: it is no longer realistic to suspect that a bilateral agreement, where both sides demand concessions from each other, along with their allies, could be easily reached and enforced. Putin has, at times, dangled a moratorium on intermediate-range deployments following the INF’s demise. The United States and Russia may, at some point in the future, decide it is in their mutual interest to sit down again and discuss limits on certain missile deployments. However, as Europe now grapples with the continued prospect of war in Ukraine, along with a fierce U.S. effort for NATO countries to enhance their defenses, it’s almost certain that Europe will soon be awash in various intermediate-range missile systems. This makes the prospect of bilateral arms control moot and will exacerbate intra-European fissures about how best to deal with a revanchist Russia once the war in Ukraine ends or stalls out. The future of Europe remains fraught. The trends suggest an environment with more missiles, made by more countries, and deployed very close to Russia’s border. This is a less-than-ideal outcome for Putin, one that will certainly incentivize him to return the favor and deploy countervailing systems. This is called an arms race. Europe is, once again, at the start of one. About the author: Aaron Stein is the President of the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI).

Ukraine Defense Minister Discusses Boosting Security With South K...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Defense Minister Rustem Umerov's talks in South Korea on November 27 focused on cooperation on the security of both Ukraine and South Korea in light of the deployment of North Korean forces in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Zelenskiy said Umerov went to Seoul at his instruction to discuss all aspects of North Korea’s involvement in the war 'and the things we can do together to defend our nations and to secure our regions together.' Umerov said earlier that he had discussed joint steps to strengthen security and stability with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol while in Seoul. Umerov also met with South Korea’s defense minister and national-security adviser. 'We believe that our arguments about the need to increase cooperation between Ukraine and the Republic of Korea will lead to a tangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions,' Umerov said on Telegram. Umerov said he raised the presence of the North Korean troops and the North Korean military's 'active' support for energy infrastructure attacks on Ukraine. For South Korea, the deployment of the North Korean troops poses a serious threat because they are gaining combat experience, which could create additional security challenges, he said. A statement issued by Yoon’s office does not say whether the parties discussed the possibility of Seoul supplying weapons to Ukraine. Ukraine has previously asked Seoul for weapons, and South Korea has said it could consider such aid, depending on what Russia and North Korea do. Zelenskiy also said in his nightly address that decisions made in July at the NATO summit in Washington on air defense and other supplies to the front line 'have not yet been fully implemented…and this, of course, has had a significant impact on our people’s motivation and morale.' The recent authorization of long-range strikes on military targets in Russia 'has been helpful, but the pressure on Russia must be maintained and increased at various levels to make Russia feel what war really is,' Zelenskiy said. Russian forces have been making steady gains along the front line as Kyiv's troops battle a larger and better equipped enemy. Zelenskiy did not mention a news report that President Joe Biden's administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was quoted earlier on November 27 by the Associated Press as saying that the outgoing administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18 from 25 to help expand the pool of fighting-age men. The official said 'the pure math' of Ukraine's situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight, according to the AP. The official said the Ukrainians believe they need about 160,000 additional troops, but the U.S. administration believes they probably will need more than that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP2RndEdcRWdYhHtUTRrHG	2024-11-27T15:54:39-08:00	
Trump To Name Retired Army Lieutenant General As Special Envoy Fo...	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will nominate retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg to serve as assistant to the president and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg was chief of staff on Trump’s National Security Council during his first administration and was the national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. 'Together, we will secure peace through strength, and make America, and the world, safe again,' Trump said in a statement naming Kellogg as envoy. Kellogg spoke exclusively with VOA’s Ukrainian service in July about his vision for ending the war in Ukraine, published as part of the book, 'An America First Approach to U.S. National Security.' At the time he said he had not presented the plan to Trump nor was he a formal adviser but said the plan would be one option to consider. He recommended then that the U.S. begin a formal policy 'to seek a ceasefire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict.' The U.S. would continue to arm Ukraine to deter Russia from attacking during or after a deal is reached, under the condition that Kyiv agrees to enter into peace talks with Russia. To persuade Russia to participate in the negotiations, Kellogg wrote that the U.S. and other NATO partners would delay Ukraine's membership in the alliance for an extended period in exchange for a 'comprehensive and verifiable deal with security guarantees.' Under the imagined deal, Ukraine would not be asked to give up its ambition to regain all land seized by Russia, but Kyiv should agree to use diplomatic means only and realize that it might take a long time to regain all of the territories. The strategy proposes partial lifting of sanctions on Russia to encourage the Kremlin to take steps toward peace and establish levies on Russian energy imports to fund Ukraine's reconstruction.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP2RndEdcRWS2qH8mln-IZ	2024-11-27T15:51:18-08:00	
Will Ceasefire Deal To End Israel-Hezbollah War Achieve Lasting P...	By Najia Houssari and Anan Tello The world has largely welcomed a ceasefire deal which ends 13 months of fighting betrween Israel and Hezbollah that has claimed the lives of at least 3,700 Lebanese and more than 130 Israelis. The deal between the governments of Israel and Lebanon, brokered by the US and France, came into effect on Wednesday at 4 a.m. local time. From the Israeli army’s perspective, the war in Lebanon was coming to a point of diminishing returns. It has succeeded in weakening Hezbollah’s military standing and eliminating its top leadership but has been unable to wipe it out entirely. For its part, Hezbollah has been seriously debilitated in Lebanon; the war has eroded its military capabilities and left it rudderless. Looking at it optimistically, the diplomatic breakthrough — which unfolded on Tuesday night as Israel unleashed a barrage of bombs on central Beirut — could be the beginning of the end of the long-standing 'Israel-Iran shadow war,' as a new administration prepares to assume power in Washington. Hezbollah and the Israeli military began to exchange cross-border fire on Oct. 8, 2023, one day after Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a deadly Hamas-led attack. The conflict dramatically escalated on Sept. 23 this year, when Israel began heavily bombing several parts of Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s stronghold in the south. The airstrikes killed thousands of Lebanese, displaced some 1.2 million others, flattened residential buildings, and devastated 37 villages. While the ceasefire deal calls for a 60-day halt in hostilities, President Joe Biden said that it 'was designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.' Negotiators have described it as laying the groundwork for a lasting truce. Under the terms of the deal, Hezbollah will remove its fighters and arms from the region between the Blue Line and the Litani River, while Israeli troops will withdraw from Lebanese territory during the specified period. Thousands of Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers will deploy to the region south of the Litani River. A US-led international panel will oversee compliance from all sides. However, uncertainty persists, as both Hezbollah and Israel have warned that they will resume fire if the other party breaches the agreement. Hezbollah stated it would give the ceasefire pact a chance, but Mahmoud Qamati, the deputy chair of the group’s political council, stressed that Hezbollah’s support for the deal depends on clear assurances that Israel will not resume its attacks. Likewise, Israel said it would attack if Hezbollah violated the agreement. The army’s Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, also urged residents of southern Lebanese villages — who had fled in recent months — to delay returning home until further notice from the Israeli military. David Wood, a senior Lebanon analyst with the International Crisis Group, believes that while the ceasefire is desperately needed, it 'will almost certainly not bring Lebanon’s troubles to an end. 'Many of the country’s displaced may not be able to return home for months, as Israel has razed entire villages near the Blue Line border,' he said. 'Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s domestic foes claim they will no longer accept the group’s dominance over Lebanese politics — a pledge that promises still more instability.' Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, also cannot see this ceasefire bringing an end to Lebanon’s problems as the war has already triggered shifts in internal alliances. Describing the deal as a 'capitulation,' he said during an interview with the BBC that 'the majority of the Lebanese people, including Hezbollah's own support base, did not want to see Lebanon dragged into this war.' 'After all this devastation, after Hezbollah having now to capitulate and withdraw away from that border north of the Litani River, having to accept an American-led mechanism led by a general who is part of CENTCOM in the region, this is going to be highly embarrassing,' he said. 'And there's going to be a day of reckoning for Hezbollah in Lebanon once the ceasefire actually goes into effect.' He added that politically, this means that 'the various Lebanese parties and the various also alliances that had been in place before this war are no longer going to be there.' 'We saw, for example, Hezbollah’s crucial Christian ally distance itself from the group now, very much moving towards the center or even in opposition to Hezbollah.' Gebran Bassil, leader of the Maronite Free Patriotic Movement and a close ally of Hezbollah since 2006, said earlier this month that his party is 'not in an alliance with Hezbollah.' In an interview with Al-Arabiya TV, he added that Hezbollah 'has weakened itself and exposed its military strength, leaving Lebanon as a whole vulnerable to Israeli attacks.' Also acknowledging the toll on Hezbollah is Lebanese political analyst Ali Al-Amin. He expressed concern that, while the ceasefire deal is a positive development, its terms signal a significant shift for Hezbollah. 'People were happy at first glance about the ceasefire agreement, as it is a basic demand after a fierce, destructive war,' he told Arab News. 'However, there are many (unanswered) questions, starting with the nature of the agreement and its content. 'In a first reading, I believe that Hezbollah’s function has ended. The prohibition of military operations and weapons, the necessity of destroying and dismantling weapons facilities, and the ban on the supply of weapons are all preludes to ending the party’s function.' Hezbollah’s main ally, Tehran, expressed support for the ceasefire. Esmaeil Baghaei, spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, welcomed the end of Israel’s 'aggression against Lebanon.' He also reaffirmed his country’s 'firm support for the Lebanese government, nation and resistance.' Before the Israeli cabinet approved the deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ceasefire would allow his country to 'intensify' pressure on the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and focus on the 'Iranian threat.' Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israeli analyst with the ICG, believes that 'for Israel, the ceasefire is not necessarily an end to the war, but a pause' in fighting. She said: 'It will free up forces and resources to Israel’s other fronts in Gaza, the West Bank, and Iran, and is a chance to test out Israel’s ability to take military action to enforce the ceasefire, which is being sold as the main difference between the resolution that ended the 2006 war and this time around.' Al-Amin believes Iran, Israel’s biggest adversary, has accepted this shift affecting its ally Hezbollah. However, he stressed that while the deal remains 'subject to implementation,' it raises questions about the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and Washington’s role in overseeing its execution. Echoing Al-Amin’s concern, Heiko Wimmen, ICG project director for Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, said: 'The ceasefire is based on the commitment of both Lebanon and Israel to finally implement Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. 'The challenges are the same as 18 years ago, namely, how to make sure that both parties comply in the long term and what to do with Hezbollah’s military capabilities, which constitute a threat to the security of Israel, and potentially other Lebanese, whether they are present on the border or a few kilometers away.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who welcomed the ceasefire deal, reiterated on Wednesday his government’s commitment to implementing Resolution 1701. UN Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted to resolve the 2006 Lebanon war, called for a permanent ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, the establishment of a buffer zone free of armed personnel other than UN and Lebanese forces, Hezbollah’s disarmament and withdrawal from south of the Litani River, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. However, Maksad of the Middle East Institute, emphasizes that implementing a ceasefire in Lebanon — US-led and otherwise — will demand more than just adhering to the deal’s terms, especially on the domestic front. 'There is a crucial need to rearrange the deck in Lebanon,' he said in an interview with the BBC. 'You need to elect a president in Lebanon, one that is a sovereign-minded president that would work with the Lebanese army and provide it with the political cover it needs to help and implement this resolution together with the UN troops that are there and also the international community.' He added: 'You also cannot begin the task — the mammoth task — of rebuilding, the reconstruction, the tune of billions of dollars if you don’t have a reform-minded government.' And while the ceasefire brings a faint hope for Lebanon’s displaced population, many of those affected perceive its terms through the prism of personal loss, questioning what, if anything, had been gained from the war. Nora Farhat, whose family home in Anqoun in Beirut’s southern suburbs was reduced to rubble, lamented that the agreement 'will not restore our destroyed homes or bring back those who were killed — loved ones we have yet to bury.' The scale of destruction in southern villages means return is not an option for many, who are left wondering about Hezbollah’s future and its ability to maintain its influence in the region. Analyst Al-Amin believes that Hezbollah’s immediate focus will likely shift to managing the domestic narrative. 'Hezbollah’s priority now will be how to reverse the defeat into victory at home, and how to prevent the Lebanese from questioning what happened and why it happened,' he said. Some of those displaced from Shiite-majority villages in the south expressed frustration at being caught in the crossfire of Hezbollah’s conflicts with Israel. For Ahmad Ismail, who was displaced from his home in south Lebanon, the war and its aftermath seemed 'futile.' He told Arab News: 'There was no need to open a southern front under the slogan of supporting Gaza, as those who sought this war sought to humiliate us. 'If only we had implemented the May 17 agreement in the 1980s with Israel, we would have been spared wars, killing and destruction, and the Shiite sect would not have reached the point of displacement, death, and frustration it has reached today.' Ismail, who was previously imprisoned in Israel, believes the ceasefire is the only positive aspect of the US-brokered truce deal. 'It is a good initiative toward making this the last of the wars and a step toward disarming illegal weapons,' he said. 'It also paves the way for restoring the state to its role, which Hezbollah undermined by monopolizing decisions of war and peace without consulting anyone.' Despite the Israeli military’s warning, Lebanese people displaced from their homes in the south began flocking to their villages. Ismail believes 'people are currently in shock. Some still cannot believe that Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has been killed, and many have not yet seen what happened to their homes and villages. 'When they wake up from the trauma, we will see the repercussions.' Ismail added: 'A disaster has befallen the Lebanese people, and Hezbollah must be held accountable. Hezbollah is no longer able to mobilize the people through the power of weapons, excess force, and money.' As Lebanon begins to pick up the pieces, many still wonder if this ceasefire will offer more than just a temporary reprieve — or if it will be the beginning of an uncertain future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeicgYiRV2dZlL45X0am235	2024-11-27T15:49:33-08:00	
Outgoing President Biden Must Use US Laws To Rein In Israel – OpE...	When an elected American official has to worry about getting reelected, they often restrain themselves and avoid pursuing controversial policies. But when the reelection option is no longer available and they are in what is termed a lame duck period of office, the elected official can do whatever they want within their powers without worrying about voter consequences or their critics. That is the situation Joe Biden is currently in as he prepares to relinquish the powerful office of president of the United States. He is effectively more powerful today than he was on the first day of his presidency. As president, Biden can take actions that do not require approval from Congress, including major foreign policy moves. These include negotiating agreements and recognizing foreign governments. As the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he can also take many military actions, such as ordering military operations or unit deployments, though long-term actions would require eventual congressional approval under the US War Powers Act. We have already seen Biden exercise these powers with respect to the Ukraine-Russia war. Biden this month removed restrictions that had been placed on Ukraine’s use of US-supplied long-range missiles, allowing them to be fired into Russia and not simply used against troops that had entered Ukrainian territory. This decision changes the war’s dynamics, giving Ukraine’s armed forces the ability to launch offensive assaults to counter Russia’s bombings of its cities and other targets. Ukraine’s other major weapons suppliers in NATO, including the UK and France, now appear to have followed suit and removed restrictions on the arms they supply or are at least considering doing so. Why can Biden not do the same thing with Israel and stop the flow of US weaponry and funding that is fueling Tel Aviv’s genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza? During the past year, the majority of people injured or killed in Gaza have been civilians. Although it is estimated that more than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed, there is no way of knowing the precise number because Israel prohibits foreign journalists from entering the Strip. There is more than enough justification for Biden to do now what his administration failed to do when Israel began its war on Gaza last October. All he has to do is apply the American laws that prohibit the supplying of weapons to foreign nations that engage in the killing of civilians and genocide. There are five laws that restrict how foreign countries can use US money and weapons. However, until now, the outgoing administration has refused to enforce them. The Leahy Law prohibits the US government from using any funds to assist foreign security force units when credible information exists that implicates that unit in the commission of gross human rights violations. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibits the allocation of financial assistance to any foreign government that 'engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.' The Arms Export Control Act states that foreign nations that receive US military aid can only use the weapons for legitimate self-defense and internal security. The War Crimes Act forbids breaches of the Geneva Conventions, which define the rules of warfare and prohibit the mistreatment of noncombatants and civilians, such as willful killings, torture or inhuman treatment, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and unlawful deportation or transfer. These are all methods routinely used by Israel to enforce its illegal occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. And the Genocide Convention Implementation Act was enacted in 1987 and establishes genocide as a specific crime. It provides for criminal penalties for individuals who commit or incite others to commit genocide. Each of these five laws give Biden the power to take action against Israel and end the ferocity of its military assault against Gaza and Lebanon. What does Biden have to lose? The election is over. His party lost. The outgoing administration has eight weeks to make up for its grievous failure of the last 13 months and try to stop the killing of civilians. Even if this action does not end the war or if Israel continues the carnage, at least it could help to restore a moral foundation to the administration’s legacy. Does it really want to be known as the administration that stood by as Israel killed more than 44,000 Palestinian civilians and thousands more Lebanese civilians? But the White House is hostage to Netanyahu, who needs the genocide to continue in order to derail the three corruption cases against him. It was these charges that pushed Netanyahu to form a coalition with the most extremist elements in Israeli society and extend his time in power. As a consequence, Netanyahu has no compelling reason to end the genocide and he will most likely continue the violence. He may even expand it to include Iran and any other regional nation that refuses to surrender to Israel’s hegemony. When the details of Israel’s atrocities become public — and one day they will — the US will be harshly judged for not acting. Unless it acts now. It is the right thing to do.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeicgYiRV2dZmogoS9DTmbc	2024-11-27T15:47:16-08:00	
RFK Jr., Physicians’ Pay Schedules, And The Elites’ Big Lie – OpE...	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is known first and foremost for his anti-vaccine crusades. However, he has also been saying some things that make sense. When Donald Trump first announced him as his pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), he announced his plans to go after the corruption in the pharmaceutical industry. This has the potential to shake up an industry that costs the country more than $650 billion a year, or $5,000 per family. More recently he indicated his intention to go after the pay schedules for physicians in Medicare. This is also a really big deal. The Medicare pay schedules for physicians are largely designed by the physicians themselves, with the specialists deciding how much Medicare should pay them. The result is a system that tends to hugely overpay specialists, partly at the expense of primary care physicians and partly at the expense of the rest of us who must foot Medicare’s bill. The impact of Medicare’s physician payment structure is amplified by the fact that many private insurers follow Medicare in setting their own compensation levels for physicians’ services. This is a big part of the story of why we pay our doctors so much more than doctors in other wealthy countries. The average doctor in the US gets paid over $365,000 a year. This is more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries. If we paid our physicians as much as doctors in Germany or Canada, it would save us close to $200 billion a year. The high pay for our specialists is a big part of this story. While our primary care physicians also get paid more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries, the gap is much larger for specialists. Also, a much larger share of our physicians are specialists than in other countries. In most countries primary care physicians do many of the tasks for which we rely on highly paid specialists. The story of doctors’ pay is big money, more than is at stake in things like the expanded child tax credit or other issues that we often have major political battles over. However, it is almost never raised as a topic for political debate. Or at least had not been before RFK Jr. brought it up. A major part of the story is that it runs at odds with the Big Lie has dominated the debate over economic policy for the last half-century. The Big Lie is that the debate has been over whether we should have 'neoliberal' free market policies or whether we should have social welfare policies that protect ordinary people from the market. The physician pay schedule story undermines the Big Lie because it is a way in which the government is very directly intervening in the market to shift income upward, giving money to roughly 1 million physicians at the expense of everyone else. It is not the whole story of government intervention boosting doctors’ pay. The government also severely restricts the ability of foreign-trained physicians to practice in the United States, even as our 'free trade' policies have sought to put manufacturing workers in direct competition with low-paid workers in the developing world. And we have all sorts of restrictions on the activities of physicians’ assistants and nurse practitioners that require doctors to do many tasks for which lower-paid health care professionals are fully qualified. These rules are great examples of how the government has structured the market to benefit a narrow groups of very highly-paid workers while imposing higher health care costs on everyone else. The government-granted patent monopolies, which make drugs expensive, is another very important example. These shift close to $500 billion a year in income to the drug companies. This is the story I tell in Rigged: How Globalization and the Rules of the Modern Economy Were Structured to Make the Rich Richer(it’s free). The basic point is that there is no 'neoliberal' free-market. The market is infinitely malleable and can be structured in ways that produce hugely different outcomes. Those with political power have used it to structure the market in ways that give themselves more money. It is understandable that those who like the resulting distribution of income would be anxious to blame it on the workings of a free market, but for some reason those who claim to want more equality also accept this Big Lie. RFK Jr.’s plans to overhaul the Medicare physicians’ payment system, as well as efforts to end corruption in the pharmaceutical industry, both could lead to less inequality and undermine the Big Lie theory of inequality. As much as I would like to see progress in both areas, I still can’t stomach RFK Jr. His anti-vaccine rants threaten the enormous progress we have made in improving public health with vaccines over the centuries. His fantasies and lies also threaten the lives of people who have spent their careers trying to develop and promote vaccines in the interest of saving lives. They also have been blatantly racist and antisemitic. I’m afraid that I can’t see a scenario where I want to see someone like RFK Jr. hold a position of major responsibility in the government. However, I would like people to take at least some of the things he says seriously.

Feud With Marcos Beyond ‘Point Of No Return,’ Philippine VP Sara ...	By Camille Elemia Philippine Vice-President Sara Duterte said her feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had reached a 'point of no return' after police filed an assault complaint against her and some of her staff. The Philippine National Police (PNP) lodged the complaint on Wednesday amid an uproar over remarks where Duterte publicly threatened Marcos by saying he would be assassinated should she be targeted and killed in a plot. Her comments prompted the president to say that he would 'fight back.' The police accused Duterte and her staff of alleged 'direct assault, disobedience and grave coercion' during the transfer of the vice-president’s chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, to a government-run hospital from the House of Representatives detention center last weekend. The PNP said it had filed a case against Duterte, her chief security aide Col. Raymond Dante Lachica, and two others before the Quezon City Prosecutor’s Office in Metro Manila. In response, the vice-president said that the allegations levelled against her 'don’t hold any water.' 'I believe we reached the point of no return and it is clear [that] they are really going after me,' Duterte said Wednesday at a press conference in southern Zamboanga City, where she holds a satellite office, when asked about the possibility of her and Marcos patching things up. 'They really want to remove me from my post.' Lt. Col. Van Jason Villamor, chief of the Quezon City police district’s medical and dental unit, and four other police officers filed the complaint. Villamor was directed to accompany Lopez during the transfer. Lopez was ordered detained at the House last week for contempt after a congressional committee accused her of trying to hamper an inquiry into the alleged budget misuse of 125 million pesos (U.S. $2.13 million) of Duterte’s office in Duterte’s role as vice president and the former education secretary. Lopez was later ordered transferred to a hospital after an unspecified health concern. She was supposed to be moved to jail, but Duterte initially prevented it. In a press conference held earlier on Wednesday, police spokesperson Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo showed a video supposedly showing Duterte and Lachica pushing Villamor, preventing him from fulfilling the order to accompany Lopez during her transfer to the hospital. 'We cannot let this pass,' Fajardo said during the briefing. National police chief Gen. Rommel Marbil said the national force trusted that the courts would conduct 'a fair and impartial investigation into these serious allegations.' 'The Philippine National Police remains steadfast in its commitment to uphold justice and ensure that all individuals are held accountable under the law, regardless of their position,' Marbil said in a statement Wednesday. 'We respect the legal process and trust that the courts will conduct a fair and impartial investigation into these serious allegations.' Also on Wednesday, Marcos adviser and ally Larry Gadon filed a disbarment complaint against Duterte before the Supreme Court over her statement last weekend that she had arranged the assassination of the president, first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, and House Speaker Martin Romualdez in case she herself were killed. The National Bureau of Investigation has subpoenaed the vice president over the verbal threat. But Duterte denied making it and said her statement was maliciously taken out of context. Marcos and Duterte – both children of former presidents and scions of influential political Philippine families – had formed a political alliance to win the general election two years ago, but the partnership ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the government to allow an international investigation into the controversial drug war waged by Marcos’ predecessor and Sara’s father, Rodrigo Duterte. The ongoing political feud between Marcos and Duterte could impact foreign policy and the midterm elections in May 2025, observers say. But one political analyst said she would not be surprised if an impeachment complaint were filed against Sara Duterte. 'If [an impeachment complaint against Duterte] happens, it’s something that’s par for the course because of what had transpired,' said Jean Encinas-Franco of the University of the Philippines on Wednesday. 'Her statements actually earned the Marcos administration the legitimacy to go after her,' Encinas-Franco told ABS-CBN’s news program 'Top Story.' 'The threat to kill is very different and something probably unthinkable for most people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWH3_MFbWInQO	2024-11-27T15:35:58-08:00	
Brazil: Federal Police Say Bolsonaro Left Country In 2022 To Avoi...	By Andre Richter The Federal Police concluded that former President Jair Bolsonaro left Brazil in late 2022 to avoid potential arrest and to monitor the outcome of the January 8, 2023, coup attempts from abroad. In the final days of his mandate in December 2022, Bolsonaro traveled to the United States, returning only in March 2023. The details are outlined in a Federal Police report indicting Bolsonaro and 36 others on charges of attempting a coup d'état and the violent abolition of democratic rule of law. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the rapporteur for the coup investigation, lifted the document's secrecy on Tuesday (Nov. 26). Investigators revealed in the report that an escape plan, devised in 2021, outlined steps for the former president to leave Brazil 'if his attack on the judiciary and the democratic regime faced setbacks that could jeopardize his freedom.' During the investigation, police discovered a PowerPoint presentation on the computer of Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former aide and one of the whistleblowers. The document outlined strategies for establishing an escape and evasion support network, to be employed if Bolsonaro chose to defy Supreme Court decisions. The plan also included the use of weapons to facilitate the escape. According to the investigations, the 2021 escape plan was adapted after the group failed to implement a coup d'état in 2022. 'The escape plan was adapted and used at the end of 2022, when the criminal organization was unsuccessful in carrying out the coup d'état,' the report points out. The police concluded, 'After failing to secure the Armed Forces' support for an institutional rupture, Jair Bolsonaro left the country to evade potential arrest and await the outcome of the January 8, 2023 coup attempts.' The defense Agência Brasil is attempting to contact Bolsonaro's defense and is open to including its statement in the article. At a press conference on Monday (25), the former president declared that he 'never discussed a coup with anyone,' adding that all actions taken during his administration were within 'the four corners of the Constitution.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWG02XAMeMq0t	2024-11-27T15:33:33-08:00	
Iran Says It Will Run Thousands Of Centrifuges In Response To EU3	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said following a resolution initiated by the European troika that the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors passed against Iran, Tehran will put thousands of advanced homegrown centrifuges into operation in retaliation. Araqchi and his Spanish counterpart J​ose Manuel Albares Bueno held a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Forum in Portugal’s Cascais on Tuesday. The two diplomats discussed issues of mutual interest, including bilateral relations as well as regional and international developments. Araqchi underscored Iran's principled approach of fostering interaction and cooperation to promote peace and understanding among nations and cultures, the Foreign Ministry’s website reported. He also highlighted the importance of adhering to the rule of law in international relations and respecting international norms and principles. Addressing the precarious situation in West Asia, Araqchi attributed the ongoing genocide and aggression of the Zionist regime against Lebanon and other regional states to the regime’s impunity. The Iranian minister described the comprehensive military and political support provided by the United States and certain European countries as complicity in war crimes and genocide. He also called for decisive global action to halt Israel’s atrocities and warmongering, emphasizing the need to prosecute and hold the leaders of the Zionist regime accountable. Reviewing the recent developments in Iran-Europe relations, Araqchi criticized the confrontational and interfering policies of certain European states as unjustifiable and counterproductive. He warned that in response to the European resolution against Iran in the IAEA Board of Governors, Iran will be activating thousands of advanced centrifuges. Araqchi also reiterated the necessity of addressing international and regional issues with a realistic and law-based approach, emphasizing the need for constructive engagement to resolve the common challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWHDB9JqPtCtc	2024-11-27T15:29:08-08:00	
ACN Report: North Koreans In Contact With Christians Are Sent To ...	By Eduardo Berdejo North Koreans who are repatriated from China and who have had contact with Christians are sent to North Korean political prisoner camps, according to the latest report on religious freedom by the pontifical foundation Aid to the Church in Need (ACN). 'Persecuted and Forgotten? A Report on Christians oppressed for their Faith 2022-24' was published this month during Red Week and is an initiative by ACN to draw attention to religious persecution around the world. The 2024 edition addresses the situation in 18 key countries, including North Korea. North Korea is a communist nation ruled since 1948 by the Kim dynasty, and although 'gauging the true number of Christians or the extent of their faith in North Korea is exceedingly difficult,' says ACN, 'they are estimated to comprise around 0.38 percent of the population, which equates to just over 98,000 people.' However, despite the small number of believers, Christianity is considered a threat to the state, which is why Christians are forced to go underground. According to the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), the entire population is forced to follow Juche, 'an ideology of Marxist ‘self-reliance’ created by the country’s founder, Kim Il-Sung.' To escape the country, North Koreans often use the extensive 880 mile border with China. If they manage to get past the tightly controlled border, the fugitives must reach a third border undetected, mostly Thailand, and seek asylum in the South Korean embassy, ​​which will send them to South Korea. However, those who are apprehended by the Chinese authorities are repatriated to North Korea. According to Human Rights Watch, in April the Beijing government deported some 60 North Koreans. In its report, ACN refers to the defectors who were repatriated in October 2023 and said there is cause for concern for those 'who had interacted with Christians while they were outside the country. They were all sent to political prisoner camps, known for the harsh treatment of inmates there.' The report notes that while many served reduced sentences, 'those who came into contact with Christianity' were interned 'in political prisoner camps, which is in fact a life sentence without parole.' Citing a source In North Korea who spoke anonymously for security reasons to Daily NK, the ACN report said that 'North Korean state security departments base their interrogations of repatriated defectors on files provided by the Chinese police.' 'If anything related to religion is mentioned in the files, the defectors will be inexorably interned in camps' no matter what they say concerning what happened, the report notes. Believers are considered 'a hostile class' The pontifical foundation states that in North Korea, 'considered the worst country in the world to be a Christian,' people are classified according to their loyalty to the state and 'believers are automatically considered a ‘hostile class’ and subjected to relentless persecution.' 'Although there are widespread violations of human rights throughout the country and religious oppression affecting all areas of life and all religious groups, according to the U.S. State Department, Christians and followers of Mugyo (a shamanic religion) are the most persecuted,' the report explains. Illyong Ju, a North Korean defector who is now a Christian, told ACN that repatriated defectors are being forced to confess anything they may know about the 1,000 people who have not yet been repatriated to North Korea before they actually arrive in the country. However, Illyong Ju emphasized that among the defectors 'there will be people who believe in Jesus and who will spread the Gospel wherever they go. Like Sister Kim, who works with me and who evangelized eight people while she was in a North Korean prison due to her forced repatriation.' 'Therefore, we have faith that those forcibly returned to North Korea will become amazing members of God’s People who will rise up against the oppression of the North Korean regime,' he said.

Global Food Yields Have Grown Steadily During Last Six Decades	Contrary to widespread concerns that global crop yields have stagnated in recent decades, a comprehensive study of worldwide food production finds yields have continued to grow at roughly the same rate since the 1960s. John Baffes of the World Bank and Xiaoli Etienne of the University of Idaho, U.S., report these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE. Almost 10 billion people are expected to inhabit Earth by 2050, so agricultural production will become increasingly critical to feeding the growing population. Over the past six decades, much of the growth in food production has stemmed from technological advances, including the widespread development and use of better crop varieties. But some studies have suggested that the growth in production has leveled off, raising concerns about future food availability, especially in the low- and middle-income countries with the highest population growth. In the new study, the researchers developed standardized measures for production and yield for 144 crops, covering 98 percent of global agricultural land. These measures allow scientists and policymakers to compare agricultural productivity across different countries and regions. The researchers found that there has been no discernable slowdown in the global growth of crop yields during the last six decades – any observed slowdown in specific crops, regions or countries has been offset by gains in others. Their findings show that yields grew annually at a rate equivalent to about 33 kg of wheat per hectare. While the study’s findings are reassuring from a global food supply perspective, the researchers caution that sustainable food production and the affordability of food will continue to be challenges to global food security. They emphasize that these concerns are particularly relevant in the face of intensifying climate change and increased demand for food due to population and income growth. The authors add: 'Utilizing a comprehensive caloric-based index of production and yield for 144 crops, covering 98% of global agricultural land and food output, this paper reveals that, on an aggregate level, global yield growth—a vital indicator of agricultural productivity—has not slowed over the past six decades. This steady growth equates to an annual increase of approximately 33 kilograms of wheat per hectare, highlighting continued productivity gains worldwide.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc8Ptjki1dQWMY9wKjf77_r	2024-11-27T15:25:46-08:00	
Food Additive Carrageenan (E 407) Could Disrupt Intestinal Barrie...	The food additive carrageenan - also known as E 407 - is used by the food industry as an emulsifier and thickening agent in numerous finished products. Studies have shown that the additive can lead to the development of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, ulcers and increased blood sugar levels in animals. However, it is not yet known what effect carrageenan has on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in humans. This question has now been investigated in a clinical study led by DZD researchers Prof. Dr. Med. Robert Wagner and Prof. Dr. Med. Norbert Stefan. Increasing the permeability of the small intestine In the study, young, healthy men with a BMI of less than 30 kg/m² (average BMI 24.5 kg/m²) were given either carrageenan in addition to their normal diet, in an amount roughly equivalent to two to three times the daily dose consumed in the USA, or a placebo. Both groups were observed over a period of two weeks. The results showed an increase in the permeability of the small intestine, most likely due to inflammation of the gut. 'Our investigation suggests that the consumption of carrageenan, similar to what has been observed in animal studies, can impair the barrier function of the intestine,' explains Prof. Robert Wagner. 'This could have long-term health consequences and increase the risk of inflammatory diseases.' The data indicated that participants with higher body weight experienced a reduction in insulin sensitity The primary endpoint of the study was insulin sensitivity—the effectiveness of the blood sugar-lowering hormone insulin—which decreases early on before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Although the insulin action was not significantly altered by carrageenan in the 20 study participants, the data indicated that participants with higher body weight experienced a reduction in insulin effectiveness, especially in the liver, with increased consumption of carrageenan. Furthermore, more overweight men tended to increase the inflammatory markers in the blood and show signs of inflammation in the hypothalamus—the brain region responsible for sugar metabolism and appetite—under higher carrageenan intake. Further research on the health impacts of carrageenan is necessary. 'Our subjects were, on average, probably still too healthy to show significant metabolic effects from carrageenan,' says Prof. Norbert Stefan. 'However, in older or overweight individuals, the effects could be stronger. To confirm this, further studies in these population groups are necessary.' The researchers emphasize the importance of further investigations into the effects of carrageenan on the human body. 'Given the widespread use of carrageenan in foods, potential health risks should be taken seriously,' concludes Prof. Wagner. 'It’s important that we understand how food additives can affect our health in order to make informed recommendations to the public.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homF8i5kwdxT2n	2024-11-27T15:23:52-08:00	
New Paper Provides Insight Into ‘Boycott And Buycott’ Of Russian ...	More than ten per cent of Chinese citizens who took part in a survey say they are willing to boycott Russian goods and most likely disapprove of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, says new research led by Lancaster University. This important finding, say the researchers, indicates that a substantial minority of the Chinese population might not share the official position of the Chinese Communist Party despite widespread propaganda and censorship. Published this week in the Journal of Contemporary China, the research ‘Willingness to Boycott Russian Goods in China: How Political Ideology Shapes Consumer Preferences in an Authoritarian Context’ is authored by Dr Barbara Yoxon, of Lancaster University, Xue Bai, of Lancaster University and Richard Turcsanyi, of Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, says the article, the government of the People’s Republic of China has refused to condemn the violence and developed stronger economic and diplomatic ties with its authoritarian neighbour. Recent surveys show that most Chinese people hold a positive view of Russia, despite its war with Ukraine. Unlike previous research, the article investigates the motives of those Chinese citizens who are likely to oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It uses original survey data from 3,029 respondents in China collected as part of the ‘Sinophone Borderlands—Interaction at the Edges’ project to better understand the patterns of political engagement in an authoritarian regime. The paper suggests there is potential for anti-Russian political action in China and suggests that more organised anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian campaigns are possible in the future. That action, says the paper, would have the scope to disrupt the profit margins of Russian companies hoping to escape Western sanctions. In 2023, Russian consumer goods made up 5.1% of China’s 2023 imports and are likely to become even more common in China as Russia becomes more isolated from the Western world. 'While this share of the Chinese market might seem like a low figure, it is important to note that China is home to more than 1.5 billion consumers and even small decreases in the Sino-Russian trade volume would be a significant loss to Russian companies as the war with Ukraine continues,' says the article. By focusing on the interaction between political ideology and political consumerism, the article has identified a group of individuals who are most likely to participate in activities that go against the ideological status quo in China. This is a new avenue of research which goes beyond previous studies that focus on ethnocentric and nationalist causes of Chinese boycott and buycott practices. To help determine who is willing to boycott Russian goods, the article delineated three broad political leanings in China: liberals, neo-authoritarians, and the New Left. The results indicated that liberals, who show higher support for free market policies and lower support for social authoritarianism, are more likely than others to express willingness to boycott Russian goods. The paper argues that liberal individuals are more supportive of the liberal international order and believe that Russia and China should work with, rather than against, multilateral institutions. This means liberals are more likely to interpret NATO’s actions in Eastern Europe as defensive and see Russian actions against Ukraine as unprovoked, aggressive and disproportional. The article found that individuals with neo-authoritarian and New Left leanings are less likely to support the boycott of Russian goods. Neo-authoritarians, who desire free market reform but support the existing sociopolitical structures, were against boycotting Russian goods. They believe that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is an extension of the rivalry between authoritarian China and the liberal United States. They believe that supporting Russia, an allied autocracy, is in China’s national interest. For the New Left, the belief that NATO and the liberal international order is a form of neocolonial domination by the United States has also led to greater levels of support for Russian goods. While it is not surprising, adds the paper, that individuals with more liberal leanings are likely to oppose Russian actions, this is the first study to date to clearly demonstrate such a link. Commenting on the paper Dr Yoxon says: 'The surprising level of anti-Russian attitudes in China suggests that an organised campaign to boycott Russian products might already be underway in China.

The turkey may be the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving dinner table now, but harvesting the iconic holiday bird could become harder in the holidays to come. If hunters continue to follow their current strategies and prey continue their same routine, turkeys may become tougher to harvest in the future, according to new research from the University of Georgia. 'Hunters should be willing to adapt because the turkeys are also adapting as well. If we continue to harvest individuals that are close to risky areas associated with hunters, turkeys will adjust their behavior and could become harder to detect and harder to harvest,' said Nickolas Gulotta, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in UGA’s Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. Gulotta studied risk-taking and exploratory behavior from 109 wild male turkeys across Georgia Wildlife management areas and how they acted in response to both hunters and predators. He and other researchers found that a turkey’s choice of movement and the level of risk associated were directly impacted by hunters and natural predators. Bold birds don’t always benefit Most of the tracked male turkeys showed frequently daring behavior. They traveled close to areas where hunters parked their cars, popular trails and roads, as well as wide open areas. That’s great news for hunters — but not so great for the turkeys. 'If turkeys are closer to these open areas, it’s going to be easier for both a hunter and a predator to detect them. Across both study sites in general, turkeys that took more risks were more likely to be harvested,' Gulotta said. That bodes well for the initial waves of hunters. But when future turkeys see how that turned out for their predecessors, they are unlikely to make those same choices. That means hunters may have to get more creative to find the birds and be more patient. 'Turkeys are obviously adapting and learning that if you’re closer to risky areas, then there’s potential to be harvested. That’s why some of them are adopting less risky behaviors that essentially make them less detectable,' said Gulotta. 'If hunters harvest birds that are riskier and more detectable, it could become more difficult to harvest turkeys because we could be left with a bunch of individuals that are harder to detect.' Predator vs. poultry presents another challenge for turkeys The turkeys that avoided those areas beneficial for hunters often remained static or in high cover areas to survive. A big giveaway for hunters is when turkeys gobble. So, when the birds don’t move around or yap in open spaces, that makes things more challenging for the humans. Turkeys don’t keep calendars, though, so when the hunters vacate and those relaxed routines remain, predators can move in. 'There are certain traits associated with outlasting the hunting season, like hiding in areas with good cover and reducing the distance traveled within a day. But in turn, if turkeys stay in the same area and don’t travel a lot, then they’re going to be more likely to be detected by a predator,' said Gulotta. 'It’s kind of a catch-22 where if they can survive that hunting season, they’re most likely going to be fine. But at the same time, too, if they don’t travel that fast and are predictable, then they have the potential to be killed by a predator.' Future fowl and humans can learn from each other Individual behaviors of turkeys can of course vary, and overall survival techniques are something that can be inherited. This study shows a need for tailored hunting strategies based on local conditions. If an area is patterned with the habitual actions of hunters, then turkeys could become harder to harvest over time. Gulotta said that could also have a long-term impact on hunting license sales and overall hunter satisfaction. 'The turkeys closer to areas that hunters use are the ones that are harvested,' Gulotta said. 'So if we continue to harvest them like that across the Southeast, then there’s the potential that we could shift the behavioral strategies of wild turkeys making them more difficult to harvest.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homEMqhbXSisRU	2024-11-27T15:19:34-08:00	
Oceans Emit Sulfur And Cool The Climate More Than Previously Thou...	Researchers have quantified for the first time the global emissions of a sulfur gas produced by marine life, revealing it cools the climate more than previously thought, especially over the Southern Ocean. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows that the oceans not only capture and redistribute the sun's heat, but produce gases that make particles with immediate climatic effects, for example through the brightening of clouds that reflect this heat. It broadens the climatic impact of marine sulfur because it adds a new compound, methanethiol, that had previously gone unnoticed. Researchers only detected the gas recently, because it used to be notoriously hard to measure and earlier work focussed on warmer oceans, whereas the polar oceans are the emission hotspots. The research was led by a team of scientists from the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) and the Blas Cabrera Institute of Physical Chemistry (IQF-CSIC) in Spain. They included Dr Charel Wohl, previously at ICM-CSIC and now at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK. Their findings represent a major advance on one of the most groundbreaking theories proposed 40 years ago about the role of the ocean in regulating the Earth's climate. This suggested that microscopic plankton living on the surface of the seas produce sulfur in the form of a gas, dimethyl sulphide, that once in the atmosphere, oxidizes and forms small particles called aerosols. Aerosols reflect part of the solar radiation back into space and therefore reduce the heat retained by the Earth. Their cooling effect is magnified when they become involved in making clouds, with an effect opposite to, but of the same magnitude as, that of the well-known warming greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide or methane. The researchers argue that this new work improves our understanding of how the climate of the planet is regulated by adding a previously overlooked component and illustrates the crucial importance of sulfur aerosols. They also highlight the magnitude of the impact of human activity on the climate and that the planet will continue to warm if no action is taken. Dr Wohl, of UEA’s Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences and one of the lead authors, said: 'This is the climatic element with the greatest cooling capacity, but also the least understood. We knew methanethiol was coming out of the ocean, but we had no idea about how much and where. We also did not know it had such an impact on climate. 'Climate models have greatly overestimated the solar radiation actually reaching the Southern Ocean, largely because they are not capable of correctly simulating clouds. The work done here partially closes the longstanding knowledge gap between models and observations.' With this discovery, scientists can now represent the climate more accurately in models that are used to make predictions of +1.5 ºC or +2 ºC warming, a huge contribution to policy making. 'Until now we thought that the oceans emitted sulfur into the atmosphere only in the form of dimethyl sulphide, a residue of plankton that is mainly responsible for the evocative smell of shellfish,' said Dr Martí Galí, a researcher at the ICM-CSIC and another of the main study authors. Dr Wohl added: 'Today, thanks to the evolution of measurement techniques, we know that plankton also emit methanethiol, and we have found a way to quantify, on a global scale, where, when and in what quantity this emission occurs. 'Knowing the emissions of this compound will help us to more accurately represent clouds over the Southern Ocean and calculate more realistically their cooling effect.' The researchers gathered all the available measurements of methanethiol in seawater, added those they had made in the Southern Ocean and the Mediterranean coast, and statistically related them to seawater temperature, obtained from satellites. This allowed them to conclude that, annually and on a global average, methanethiol increases known marine sulfur emissions by 25%. 'It may not seem like much, but methanethiol is more efficient at oxidising and forming aerosols than dimethyl sulfide and, therefore, its climate impact is magnified,' said co-lead Dr Julián Villamayor, a researcher at IQF-CSIC. The team also incorporated the marine emissions of methanethiol into a state-of-the-art climate model to assess their effects on the planet's radiation balance. It showed the impacts are much more visible in the Southern Hemisphere, where there is more ocean and less human activity, and therefore the presence of sulfur from the burning of fossil fuels is lower. The work was supported by funding from organisations including the European Research Council and Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homDiYE-5VYhRG	2024-11-27T15:17:22-08:00	
The Sound Of Traffic Increases Stress And Anxiety	Manmade sounds such vehicle traffic can mask the positive impact of nature soundscapes on people’s stress and anxiety, according to a new study published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Paul Lintott of the University of the West of England, U.K., and Lia Gilmour of the Bat Conservation Trust, U.K. Existing research shows that natural sounds, like birdsong, can lower blood pressure, heart, and respiratory rates, as well as self-reported stress and anxiety. Conversely, anthropogenic soundscapes, like traffic or aircraft noise, are hypothesized to have negative effects on human health and wellbeing in a variety of ways. In the new study, 68 student volunteers listened to three 3-minute soundscapes: a nature soundscape recorded at sunrise in West Sussex, U.K., the same soundscape combined with 20 mile per hour road traffic sounds, and the same soundscape with 40 mile per hour traffic sounds. General mood and anxiety were assessed before and after the soundscapes using self-reported scales. The study found that listening to a natural soundscape reduced self-reported stress and anxiety levels, and also enhanced mood recovery after a stressor. However, the benefits of improved mood associated with the natural soundscape was limited when traffic sounds were included. The natural soundscape alone was associated with the lowest levels of stress and anxiety, with the highest levels reported after the soundscape that included 40 mile per hour traffic. The authors conclude that reducing traffic speed in urban areas might influence human health and wellbeing not only through its safety impacts, but also through its effect on natural soundscapes. The authors add: 'Our study shows that listening to natural soundscapes can reduce stress and anxiety, and that anthropogenic sounds such as traffic noise can mask potential positive impacts. Reducing traffic speeds in cities is therefore an important step towards more people experiencing the positive effects of nature on their health and wellbeing.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homF1EKiUcN9u1	2024-11-27T15:14:42-08:00	
Unexplained Heat-Wave ‘Hotspots’ Are Popping Up Across The Globe	Earth's hottest recorded year was 2023, at 2.12 degrees F above the 20th-century average. This surpassed the previous record set in 2016. So far, the 10 hottest yearly average temperatures have occurred in the past decade. And, with the hottest summer and hottest single day, 2024 is on track to set yet another record. All this may not be breaking news to everyone, but amid this upward march in average temperatures, a striking new phenomenon is emerging: distinct regions are seeing repeated heat waves that are so extreme, they fall far beyond what any model of global warming can predict or explain. A new study provides the first worldwide map of such regions, which show up on every continent except Antarctica like giant, angry skin blotches. In recent years these heat waves have killed tens of thousands of people, withered crops and forests, and sparked devastating wildfires. 'The large and unexpected margins by which recent regional-scale extremes have broken earlier records have raised questions about the degree to which climate models can provide adequate estimates of relations between global mean temperature changes and regional climate risks,' says the study. 'This is about extreme trends that are the outcome of physical interactions we might not completely understand,' said lead author Kai Kornhuber, an adjunct scientist at the Columbia Climate School's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. 'These regions become temporary hothouses.' Kornhuber is also a senior research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. The study was just published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study looks at heat waves over the past 65 years, identifying areas where extreme heat is accelerating considerably faster than more moderate temperatures. This often results in maximum temperatures that have been repeatedly broken by outsize, sometimes astonishing, amounts. For instance, a nine-day wave that hammered the U.S. Pacific Northwest and southwestern Canada in June 2021 broke daily records in some locales by 30 degrees C, or 54 F. This included the highest ever temperature recorded in Canada, 121.3 F, in Lytton, British Columbia. The town burned to the ground the next day in a wildfire driven in large part by the drying of vegetation in the extraordinary heat. In Oregon and Washington state, hundreds of people died from heat stroke and other health conditions. These extreme heat waves have been hitting predominantly in the last five years or so, though some occurred in the early 2000s or before. The most hard-hit regions include populous central China, Japan, Korea, the Arabian peninsula, eastern Australia and scattered parts of Africa. Others include Canada's Northwest Territories and its High Arctic islands, northern Greenland, the southern end of South America and scattered patches of Siberia. Areas of Texas and New Mexico appear on the map, though they are not at the most extreme end. According to the report, the most intense and consistent signal comes from northwestern Europe, where sequences of heat waves contributed to some 60,000 deaths in 2022 and 47,000 deaths in 2023. These occurred across Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and other countries. Here, in recent years, the hottest days of the year are warming twice as fast the summer mean temperatures. The region is especially vulnerable in part because, unlike places like the United States, few people have air conditioning, because traditionally it was almost never needed. The outbreaks have continued; as recently as this September, new maximum temperature records were set in Austria, France, Hungary, Slovenia, Norway and Sweden. The researchers call the statistical trends 'tail-widening'―that is, the anomalous occurrence of temperatures at the far upper end, or beyond, anything that would be expected with simple upward shifts in mean summer temperatures. But the phenomenon is not happening everywhere; the study shows that maximum temperatures across many other regions are actually lower than what models would predict. These include wide areas of the north-central United States and south-central Canada, interior parts of South America, much of Siberia, northern Africa and northern Australia. Heat is increasing in these regions as well, but the extremes are increasing at similar or lower speed than what changes in average would suggest. Climbing overall temperatures make heat waves more likely in many cases, but the causes of the extreme heat outbreaks are not entirely clear. In Europe and Russia, an earlier study led by Kornhuber blamed heat waves and droughts on wobbles in the jet stream, a fast-moving river of air that continuously circles the northern hemisphere. Hemmed in by historically frigid temperatures in the far north and much warmer ones further south, the jet stream generally confines itself to a narrow band. But the Arctic is warming on average far more quickly than most other parts of the Earth, and this appears to be destabilizing the jet stream, causing it to develop so-called Rossby waves, which suck hot air from the south and park it in temperate regions that normally do not see extreme heat for days or weeks at a time. This is only one hypothesis, and it does not seem to explain all the extremes. A study of the fatal 2021 Pacific Northwest/southwestern Canada heat wave led by Lamont-Doherty graduate student Samuel Bartusek (also a coauthor on the latest paper) identified a confluence of factors. Some seemed connected to long-term climate change, others to chance. The study identified a disruption in the jet stream similar to the Rossby waves thought to affect Europe and Russia. It also found that decades of slowly rising temperatures had been drying out regional vegetation, so that when a spell of hot weather came along, plants had fewer reserves of water to evaporate into the air, a process that helps moderate heat. A third factor: a series of smaller-scale atmospheric waves that gathered heat from the Pacific Ocean surface and transported it eastward onto land. Like Europe, few people in this region have air conditioning, because it is generally not needed, and this probably upped the death toll. The heat wave 'was so extreme, it's tempting to apply the label of a 'black swan' event, one that can't be predicted,' said Bartusek. 'But there's a boundary between the totally unpredictable, the plausible and the totally expected that's hard to categorize. I would call this more of a grey swan.' While the wealthy United States is better prepared than many other places, excessive heat nevertheless kills more people than all other weather-related causes combined, including hurricanes, tornadoes and floods. According to a study out this past August, the yearly death rate has more than doubled since 1999, with 2,325 heat-related deaths in 2023. This has recently led to calls for heat waves to be named, similar to hurricanes, in order to heighten public awareness and motivate governments to prepare. 'Due to their unprecedented nature, these heat waves are usually linked to very severe health impacts, and can be disastrous for agriculture, vegetation and infrastructure,' said Kornhuber. 'We’re not built for them, and we might not be able to adapt fast enough.' The study was also coauthored by Richard Seager and Mingfang Ting of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and H.J. Schellnhuber of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcUK8KAi_homMcdm6MKbHbC	2024-11-27T15:13:06-08:00	
Making A Difference: Efficient Water Harvesting From Air Possible	Harvesting water from the air and decreasing humidity are crucial to realizing a more comfortable life for humanity. Water-adsorption polymers have been playing a key part in atmospheric water harvesting and desiccant air conditioning, but desorption so that the polymers can be efficiently reused has been an issue. Now, Osaka Metropolitan University researchers have found a way to make desorption of these polymers more efficient. Usually, heat of around 100°C is required to desorb these polymers, but Graduate School of Engineering student Daisuke Ikegawa, Assistant Professor Arisa Fukatsu, Associate Professor Kenji Okada, and Professor Masahide Takahashi developed a liquid moisture adsorbent that requires only a temperature of around 35°C to do so. This became possible through the use of random copolymers of polyethylene glycol, which adsorbs water well, and polypropylene glycol, which adsorbs water slightly less well. The difference in their water-loving properties created a transfer mechanism that broke down the water clusters, freeing the water more easily. 'This technology has the potential to be applied not only to water supply in arid regions and places with limited energy resources, but also to ensuring access to water in times of disaster and emergency,' Dr. Fukatsu proclaimed. 'Improvements to this technology are also expected to lead to reductions in greenhouse gases and more efficient use of water resources,' Professor Takahashi added. 'From now on, we will aim to improve the liquid moisture adsorbent and increase the efficiency of the entire system in order to make it practical.' The findings are published in ACS ES&T Water.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fdORlbs475ok	2024-11-27T15:11:03-08:00	
Fossil Dung Reveals Clues To Dinosaur Success Story	In an international collaboration, researchers at Uppsala University have been able to identify undigested food remains, plants and prey in the fossilised faeces of dinosaurs. These analyses of hundreds of samples provide clues about the role dinosaurs played in the ecosystem around 200 million years ago. The findings have been published in the journal Nature. 'Piecing together ‘who ate whom’ in the past is true detective work,' says Martin Qvarnström, researcher at the Department of Organismal Biology and lead author of the study. 'Being able to examine what animals ate and how they interacted with their environment helps us understand what enabled dinosaurs to be so successful.' Palaeontologists from Uppsala University, in collaboration with researchers from Norway, Poland and Hungary, have examined hundreds of samples using advanced synchrotron imaging to visualise the hidden, internal parts of the fossilised faeces, known as coprolites, in detail. By identifying undigested food remains, plants and prey, they have recreated the structure of the ecosystems at the time when dinosaurs began their success story. The study focused on a previously underexplored region, Polish Basin, located in the Late Triassic time in the in the northern parts of the then supercontinent Pangea. The researchers built up a comprehensive picture of the Triassic and Jurassic ecosystems (from about 230 to 200 million years ago) by combining the information from the coprolites with climate data and information from other fossils: plants, bite marks, vomit, footprints and bones. 'The research material was collected over a period of 25 years. It took us many years to piece everything together into a coherent picture,' says Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki, researcher at the Department of Organismal Biology and the study’s senior author. 'Our research is innovative because we have chosen to understand the biology of early dinosaurs based on their dietary preferences. There were many surprising discoveries along the way.' The coprolites contained remains of fish, insects, larger animals and plants, some of which were unusually well preserved, including small beetles and semi-complete fish. Other coprolites contained bones chewed up by predators that, like today’s hyenas, crushed bones to obtain salts and marrow. The contents of coprolites from the first large herbivorous dinosaurs, the long-necked sauropods, surprised the researchers. These contained large quantities of tree ferns, but also other types of plants, and charcoal. The palaeontologists hypothesise that charcoal was ingested to detoxify stomach contents, as ferns can be toxic to herbivores. The research addresses a significant gap in current knowledge: the first 30 million years of dinosaur evolution during the Late Triassic period. Although much is known about their lives and extinction, the ecological and evolutionary processes that led to their rise are largely unexplored. The study results in a five-step model of dinosaur evolution that the researchers believe can explain global patterns. The team emphasises that understanding how the first dinosaurs achieved their success can offer valuable insights into prehistoric ecosystems and evolutionary processes in general. The results show that dietary diversity and adaptability were crucial survival traits during the environmental changes of the Late Triassic. 'Unfortunately, climate change and mass extinctions are not just a thing of the past. By studying past ecosystems, we gain a better understanding of how life adapts and thrives under changing environmental conditions,' says Qvarnström. 'The way to avoid extinction is to eat a lot of plants, which is exactly what the early herbivorous dinosaurs did. The reason for their evolutionary success is a true love of green and fresh plant shoots,' Niedzwiedzki concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fZksEsZ2uwv0	2024-11-27T15:09:13-08:00	
Strategic Energy Investments In Emerging Economies: JERA’s Role I...	In a bold step that underscores Japan's commitment to global energy partnerships, JERA Co. Inc., Japan's largest power generation and energy company, has invested $1 billion in Bangladesh, solidifying its role in the country's burgeoning energy sector. This investment highlights the transformative potential of international collaboration in addressing energy demands and promoting sustainable development. JERA: A Global Energy Leader with a Vision for Innovation JERA, which stands for Japan's Energy for a New Era, is a cornerstone of Japan's energy infrastructure. It generates 30% of the country's electricity with a total domestic capacity of 61,000 megawatts (MW). Beyond Japan, the company operates power plants with a combined capacity of 13,700 MW in countries including the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia. In addition to its power generation capabilities, JERA manages 35 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies, making it one of the world's largest LNG operators. The company's extensive portfolio spans six upstream projects and partnerships with LNG suppliers from 15 countries, reflecting its prowess in navigating the complex global energy market. A Strategic Move into Bangladesh's Energy Sector JERA's involvement in Bangladesh began in 2019 when it acquired the Meghnaghat 718 MW power plant from Indian conglomerate Reliance Power. This plant, once operational, will be Bangladesh's largest gas-based independent power producer (IPP). The project is backed by substantial investments from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and several major banks, including Mizuho Bank, SMBC, MUFG, and Société Générale, with insurance provided by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). The Meghnaghat project features cutting-edge equipment from General Electric (GE) and construction led by Samsung C&T Corporation under an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract. These contributions exemplify the blending of global expertise to deliver high-efficiency energy solutions. Challenges on the Path to Commissioning Despite significant progress, the Meghnaghat project has faced numerous challenges. Delays in constructing gas pipelines and securing consistent gas supplies have hampered operations. In some instances, priority for gas pipeline connections and supplies was given to local power plants, forcing JERA to finance the construction of a branch pipeline at its own expense. For the past eight months, the plant has struggled to secure the continuous gas supply necessary for commissioning and operations. According to Smitesh Vaidya, head of contracts and commercial at JERA Meghnaghat Power Limited, the project is just days away from completion, pending a reliable gas supply. 'We have made significant progress and are close to commissioning,' Vaidya said. 'With state-of-the-art facilities, highly efficient turbines, and competitive tariffs, the Meghnaghat project can significantly enhance Bangladesh's power grid and ensure uninterrupted electricity supply.' The Case for a Land-Based LNG Terminal JERA's vision for Bangladesh extends beyond the Meghnaghat plant. The company has expressed interest in establishing a land-based LNG terminal in Matarbari, a step that could revolutionize Bangladesh's energy infrastructure. Japan, a country prone to earthquakes and typhoons, operates 11 land-based LNG terminals that ensure stability and resilience in energy supply. Bangladesh, by contrast, relies on two floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) in the Bay of Bengal. These floating terminals are vulnerable to disruptions caused by cyclones and other extreme weather events. In 2024 alone, one of Bangladesh's FSRUs was out of operation for over nine months, severely affecting gas supplies and underscoring the need for more reliable infrastructure. JERA's land-based LNG terminal proposal is a timely solution that aligns with Bangladesh's growing energy needs and climate resilience goals. Expanding Horizons: Renewable Energy and Net-Zero Ambitions JERA's commitment to Bangladesh extends beyond LNG and gas-based power. In a letter to the government, the company outlined its interest in a broad spectrum of investments, including- • Renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind power.• Alternative energy solutions, including hydrogen and ammonia.• Expanding LNG supply chains to support industrial growth. The proposed investments could bring $2 to $3 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) over the next 5 to 10 years. JERA also plans to establish a local office in Dhaka, signaling its long-term commitment to the country's energy future. From a sustainability perspective, JERA's ambition aligns with Bangladesh's aspirations for net-zero emissions. The company envisions partnerships with the government to promote renewable energy and implement innovative technologies that reduce carbon footprints, fostering a greener and more resilient energy landscape. Bangladesh-Japan Partnership: A History of Trust and Growth Japan has been one of Bangladesh's most steadfast allies since the country's independence in 1971. Over the decades, Japan has provided financial and technical support for numerous infrastructure projects, ranging from bridges and roads to power plants and ports. JERA's investment is a continuation of this legacy, reinforcing Japan's role as a partner in Bangladesh's journey toward economic growth and sustainable development. Through initiatives like the Meghnaghat project and potential LNG infrastructure upgrades, Japan's contributions are shaping the future of Bangladesh's energy sector. Looking Ahead: Securing Bangladesh's Energy Future As Bangladesh seeks to expand its industrial base and improve the quality of life for its citizens, a robust and reliable energy supply is paramount. JERA's investments in the Meghnaghat power plant and its vision for land-based LNG terminals and renewable energy development represent a critical step toward meeting these goals. Realizing this vision will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders. Government support, particularly in ensuring timely gas supply and infrastructure development, will be key to unlocking the full potential of these investments. For Bangladesh, partnering with a global energy leader like JERA is more than an economic opportunity—it is a chance to build a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive energy future. By embracing innovation and fostering international collaboration, the nation is poised to emerge as a model for balancing growth with environmental stewardship. As the Meghnaghat project nears completion, it stands as a testament to what can be achieved through perseverance, partnership, and a shared commitment to progress. JERA's journey in Bangladesh is just beginning, and its success could pave the way for a new era of energy excellence in the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2faVo9CVLvkA5	2024-11-27T09:51:39-08:00	
Why The Russian Oreshnik Medium-Range Ballistic Missile Is A Game...	Russia now has a great strategic advantage over NATO In the twentieth century there were a number of major game-changers in war that enabled technology advantaged states dominate the geo-political world. The development of atomic weapons and use on Japan near the end of WWII, propelled the United States to strategic dominance, until the former USSR matched this weapons technology. Nuclear weapons enabled mutually assured destruction (MAD), which led to strategic détente until the present day. Its possible that the Russian experimental intermediate range Oreshnik missile system, incorporating new technologies may be such a game-changer in years to come. The hyper-sonic Oreshnik system, which reportedly can travel between Mach 10-12 is equipped with six rocket propelled warheads that can hit targets at such great speeds, making them very difficult to intercept and defend against. The range of potential warheads that can be loaded on the missile provide great versatility. These independent warheads can be guided very accurately onto their targets, minimizing collateral damage, if conventional weapons are used. The mobile nature of their launch systems, make the Oreshnik missile system difficult for the enemy to take out before launch, if they are camouflaged. The Oreshnik system surprised ‘western’ military experts. The use of these weapons on Ukraine as a test showed their effectiveness of hitting their assigned targets accurately, and the inability of Ukraine’s forces to intercept them. The Oreshnik intermediate ballistic missile system was the result of the US withdrawing from the Intermediate Range Ballistic Forces Treaty (INF) in 2019 under the first Trump administration. This is perhaps a massive mistake, as it has allowed Russia to gain a massive strategic advantage, unless the US has also clandestinely been developing its own system. The effect of the Oreshnik system on future warfare is that targets can be destroyed in a war theatre without the collateral damage nuclear weapons cause, leaving massive land masses uninhabitable for long periods of time. The Oreshnik system will save civilian lives, but destroy enemy command and control hubs, aviation and port facilities, troop concentrations, supple and logistic lines, and political targets, if necessary. If such a system is employed before a nuclear launch, then the nuclear deterrent can become ineffective in tactical warfare situations. In the current Ukraine situation, Russian President Putin has an alternative option to nuclear warfare, which until the Oreshnik development wasn’t available. Such capacity by the Russian military must create a caution in the minds of NATO military leaders. If nuclear warheads are used with the system, devastating blows could be made on NATO targets, without NATO forces having the ability to stop such strikes. In the Indo-Pacific region such intermediate range hyper-sonic systems could render intercontinental ballistic systems obsolete. Intermediate systems such as the Oserhnik system could devastate the military infrastructure of nations before they can utilise ballistic missiles. For countries like Australia, the AUKUS platform of nuclear submarines will do little against the potential threats intermediate hyper-sonic systems might pose. Countries like Australia may have to totally re-think its defence doctrine. In the future, the incentive to start any wars with the knowledge an enemy can immediately takeout aggressive forces before they act, will be a disincentive for attack. The Oreshnik missile system should change war doctrine in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fXax1fFwdiL_	2024-11-27T09:48:33-08:00	
Why Are Pomegranates Special? – OpEd	As pomegranate month comes to a close, it is an important time to recognize the significance that the fruit holds in society today as well as to spread awareness of the benefits of pomegranate cultivation. For centuries, pomegranates have held a unique significance across cultures and religions worldwide, celebrated for their medicinal, economic, and cultural values. In Christianity, for example, the numerous seeds of the pomegranate represent the unity of the church and a community of believers. Similarly, in Islam, pomegranates are mentioned in the Koran three times as examples of the good things created by God. In Judaism, pomegranates are a metaphor for the richness of the promised land. During the Jewish New Year, it is customary to eat the fruit one seed at a time, symbolizing their hopes for fulfilled wishes. Similar reverence of pomegranates has been seen across religious texts and ancient civilizations spanning the globe. Beyond cultural significance, pomegranates have also been recognized for their medicinal and nutritional benefits. Preparations of different parts of the plant, including the flower, fruit juice, rind, and bark, have been used to treat a wide variety of conditions, especially gastrointestinal kinds. Rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber, pomegranates also offer nutrients and anti-inflammatory properties that promote overall health and well-being. Despite being one of the earliest cultivated trees, pomegranates remain an essential agricultural crop today due to their growing requirements and economic viability. For one, their resilience to drought and adaptability to climates with cool winters and hot summers make them particularly valuable in arid regions. With relatively low water requirements and minimal inputs, pomegranate farming is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. In drought prone regions like India, North Africa, and the Mediterranean, farmers have reported increased incomes after expansion of pomegranate cultivation due to strong market demands and higher fruit price. Pomegranates offer farmers the opportunity to diversify their crops, moving away from subsistence farming towards a higher-value production and more sustainable agricultural production. The significance of pomegranates is only increasing as they are well suited to adapt to the harsher climatic conditions brought about by climate change. Currently in Morocco, there is a disconnect between farmers producing pomegranates and them processing and exporting their harvests, meaning farmers cannot take advantage of the high value that pomegranates can create. For example, the Oulad Abdellah cooperative in Morocco’s Beni Mellal region produces 12,000 tons of pomegranates annually, yet the majority of production is consumed in local markets and very little quantities are exported. Additionally, between 2023 and 2024, the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) distributed 56,329 pomegranate trees in 10 regions for 228 villages across Morocco, benefitting over 1,800 farming families. Despite the region’s fertile soil and ideal climate for pomegranate cultivation, the lack of high-value industrial processing infrastructure prevents these farmers from realizing the true economic potential of their products. Therefore, to seize the opportunity for improvement, HAF proposes to build a modern production system in Beni Mellal, the country’s epicenter of pomegranate production, to produce organic pomegranate products like juice, concentrate, seed oil, and peel powder, both for export to the EU and for domestic sales. With local sourcing of raw materials and a gradual increase in scale of processing, this proposal has the potential to generate an annual revenue of 36 million dollars at full capacity, 41 percent of which would be net margin for farmers to directly benefit from. Not only will this improve the incomes of farmers and their families, but its benefits will spread across communities in the form of tax revenue for local governments, infrastructure improvements, and stable employment opportunities for the marginalized rural population, with an emphasis on women. While pomegranate month is ending, pomegranate cultivation offers an opportunity to create lasting sustainable benefits for many farmers around the world. Far beyond agriculture, pomegranates can be the first step in a transformative process of development, influencing progress in other critical areas like women’s empowerment, water and school infrastructure, and overall health of communities. Just as they were so valued many centuries ago for their diverse benefits, pomegranates can once again become an important staple in people’s lives.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fZp-cVEvAVVq	2024-11-27T09:47:15-08:00	
Russia, Africa And Dynamics Of Nuclear Energy Cooperation – OpEd	Amid heightening of geopolitical situation, Russia, perceived as an isolated global player, has been exploring esteemed pathways to get admirable Africa's sympathy, this time capitalizing on its nuclear power technology. In practical terms, Russia has the potential capacity to support Africa's energy shortage which has hold back sustainable economic growth across the continent. Admittedly, Russia's journey, following the collapse of the Soviet era, over the past three decades, somehow, exemplifies the strength and potential of remarkable efforts taken at forging mutual energy cooperation. Perhaps, it's time to ask some critical questions as grounds for an insightful conversation into the degree of achievements and challenges, concretely on the promise of nuclear energy in Africa. Nuclear Topic Features at Summits As part of its geopolitical commitment to Africa, during a plenary sessions of the first and second Russia-Africa summits, held respectively in October 2019 and July 2023, Vladimir Putin highlighted Russia's nuclear energy cooperation with Africa. Acting in accordance with the norms of the national legislation of the Russian Federation and that of African States, for instance, the St. Petersburg summit declared among others, magnitude agreements with a focus on a wide range of pertinent questions of pursuing a joint work and outlined plans to strengthen nuclear policy as it would create a parallel basis for upgrading and raising consequently industrial development in Africa. Several speeches on Africa available at the Kremlin's official website, Putin has underscored, since his ascension to presidency 2001, the fact that the nuclear power industry, where Russia is a technological leader, offers several African partners the creation of an entire industry on a turnkey basis. Agreements on cooperation in the field of atoms for peace have been signed, and interestingly renewed as appropriate, with a number of countries in the region, while in some of them the work has never acquired any practical dimension except to create information propaganda. Joint efforts are currently being envisioned to implement the agreements reached in several previous years, at least for the past decade. According to analytical reports, African countries which signed agreements for such construction of nuclear plants by Russia as follows: Algeria (2014), Ghana (2015), Ethiopia (2019), Republic of Congo (2019), Nigeria (2012, 2016), Rwanda (2018), South Africa (2004), Sudan (2017), Tunisia (2016), Uganda (2019) and Zambia (2016). Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were signed with Kenya in 2016 and Morocco in 2017. A simple 'memorandum of understanding' on nuclear with Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali in July 2023 in St. Petersburg went viral world-wide as part of Russia's information propaganda, to show its preparedness to support their development initiatives of these French-controlled African states. Long before these summits, intergovernmental commissions set up between various African countries and Russia, nuclear diplomacy prominently featured at the ministerial levels at their regular meetings. After these meetings, cooperation on implementation of nuclear power was the light of the outcomes of discussions by heads of African regional organizations including the African Union, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, the East African Community, the Arab Maghreb Union, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Economic Community of Central African States, the Economic Community of West African States, and the African Export-Import Bank. Above-mentioned trends emphasized, as often described, trust and sincere friendship that characterizes Russia-Africa cooperation. Russia's ultimate showcase for nuclear has taken the central stage as a unique and diverse pathway to support Africa's economic development and upset energy deficiency which has affected more 800 million out of Africa's 1.4 billion people. And as a further step to strengthen strategic partnerships within its post-Soviet relations, Russian Rosatom State Corporation's official files starkly show bilateral agreements signed with more than 20 African countries. Africa's Nuclear Case Studies (i) South Africa: President Cyril Ramaphosa unswervingly promised to embark on a swift and vigorous economic resuscitation of South Africa. That proposed radical economic transformation has been crippled by energy shortage/crisis across the country, which is often rated as the best economic power in Africa. Corruption that hollowed out Eskom’s coffers under Jacob Zuma's presidency, lack of plant maintenance and sabotage were blamed for South Africa's electricity crisis. Credible reports said the government spent $1.6 billion from the budget for diesel purchases alone. Eskom's colossal debt, still equivalent to $23 billion. It suffers from electricity outages at troubled state utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. and rail and port bottlenecks take their toll, industrialization slowed, while social discontent dominates across the country. South Africa has had nuclear contract signed with Russia back from 2015 under Jacob Zuma, at the time of his presidency. According to research sources, main reason why the 2015 nuclear power agreement thrown out by the South Africa's parliament, it was an opaque unilateral deal with Moscow. South African pact with Russia's Rosatom to build nuclear reactors was deemed unlawful by a High Court in April 2017. The Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute (SAFCEI) and Earthlife Africa-Johannesburg had jointly filed the court application to stop the nuclear program. Both the Russian government and the administration of Jacob Zuma put pressure on the South African government to force through the deal by attempting to circumvent South Africa's procurement laws. The Russian government readily offered to build and operate up to eight nuclear power plants at a cost of R1 trillion ($66 billion). South Africa boasts of an excellent reputation on global stage and yet suffers from high youth unemployment, grappling with energy supply deficits and many other economic obstacles. Currently there is still down-to-earth broad disillusionment with the African National Congress (ANC). According to local African and foreign critics, despite its widened bilateral relations many foreign countries, Ramaphosa still consistently attributes weak economic performance on external factors. Corruption has become an unerasable characteristic feature of its today's politics. South Africa scored 41 points out of 100 on the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index. (ii) Arab Republic of Egypt: Quite recently in March 2023, Vladimir Putin spoke at the international parliamentary conference 'Russia – Africa in a Multipolar World' held in Moscow under the auspices of the State Duma of the Russian Federal Assembly. In fact, one key question that featured during conference was that Rosatom building a nuclear power plant in Egypt and strategic plans to expand its involvement in the development of national energy systems in the African continent. Putin notably underscored a distinctive fact that in some African countries 100-percent funding would be provided by Russian State. With Arab Republic of Egypt in North Africa, it has been in the works for several years and has a chequered history for decades. The Nuclear Power Plants Authority (NPPA) was established in 1976, and in 1983 the El Dabaa site on the Mediterranean coast was first selected. With over 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa, popular referred to as Maghreb region and part of the Arab World. Egypt is the third most populous country after Nigeria and Ethiopia in Africa. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centers of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities along the Nile Delta. Therefore, Egypt needs sufficient energy to drive its industries and for domestic utilization. Egypt's nuclear plans, however, were shelved after the Chernobyl accident. But, in 2006, Egypt announced it would revive its civilian nuclear power program, and build a 1,000 MW nuclear power station at El Dabaa. Its estimated cost, at the time, was $12.5 billion, and the plans were to do the construction with the help of foreign investors. In March 2008, Egypt signed an agreement with Russia on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Rosatom has shown interest not only Egypt but many other countries in Africa. Over the past two decades, at least, it has signed agreements irreversible guarantee the construction of nuclear energy plants and training of specialists for these countries. Rosatom State Corporation's Director General, Alexey Likhachev, emphasized these points at the first Russia-Africa summit that Rosatom has already been cooperating with more than 20 African countries, in particular, building the largest 'El-Dabaa' NPP in Egypt with an installed capacity of 4.8 GW. The total cost of construction finally fixed at $30 billion in May 2022. Research shows that Russia granted a loan $25 billion for the construction of the nuclear power plant which covers 85% of the work. The remaining expenses will be covered by the Egyptian side by attracting private investors. Under the agreement, Egypt will start payments on the loan, which is provided at 3% per annum, from October 2029. Requirements for Building Nuclear Nevertheless, Russia most often addresses nuclear policy with much propaganda these three decades after the collapse of the Soviet era. Majority of African states in search of establishing energy sovereignty relatively failed in identifying financial sources, and addressing, within the standard framework and the basic requirements set International Atomic Agency Commission. Arguably African leaders have to refine and review their political approach towards energy resolution by adopting nuclear energy, an important area of the bilateral cooperation between Russia and Africa. It has to be understood that a nuclear power program is a complex undertaking that requires meticulous planning, preparation, and investment in time, institutions, and human resources. The development of such a program does not happen overnight and can take several years to implement. Building a large-scale nuclear reactor takes thousands of workers, massive amounts of steel and concrete, thousands of components, and several systems to provide electricity, cooling, ventilation, information, control and communication. In practical terms, according to estimates, another critical question is the aggregate cost involved. There are no silver bullets when it comes to energy sources and as a future sustainable solution to energy crisis across Africa. Transparency for Building Cooperation Most of these post-Soviet years, Russia's growing opacity, agreements clouded in secrecy which feature in its policy is seriously affecting its image inside Africa. That however, it has been pushing nuclear technology to African nations both to turn a profit and to expand its political might on the continent. Despite the complexity of challenges and skepticism, there still lies significant opportunities for both bi- and multilateral cooperation between Russia and African countries. Russia and Africa has had an excellent relations dating from the Soviet times. From an objective assessment, Russia owes Africa absolutely nothing, and consequently has not made public financial commitment for investment in Africa. That has to be Africa's financial institutions preferred task of itemizing the continent's most significant priorities. Today, African countries face unprecedented challenges. Rapid population growth and the worsening energy crisis are constraining economic growth in the continent. Nuclear technologies can become a driver for socio-economic development and a comprehensive solution to the systemic continent-wide problems. But building nuclear power still faces huge financial difficulties across Africa. Without much doubts, Russia could effectively utilize its substantial nuclear technology for expanding its energy footprint on Africa's landscape. In a nutshell, Africa has long been in search for foreign finance to develop large-scale energy projects. Therefore, looking at the good foundation and highly valued the results at the previous two summits, it is now time for Russia seriously consider the unique policy perspectives and to take concrete action for deepening the Russia-Africa partnership, in addition to Egypt's El-Dabaa NPP, in building nuclear in other parts of Africa. Perhaps, the most important forward-looking approach is for the continental organization, the African Union (AU) can – and should – engage its members in a more structured manner and help them minimize the setbacks and particularly put together joint positions on this critical energy issues as relating to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and within the Agenda 2063.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUkXTy2lD2fTSrnr1-fvTf	2024-11-27T09:46:23-08:00	
Pivoting East: Bangladesh’s New Diplomatic Strategy – OpEd	In a remarkable pivot from its recent past, Bangladesh is intensifying efforts to distance itself from India's sphere of influence while seeking to strengthen ties with Pakistan and reinvigorate regional cooperation within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). These developments come at a time when growing public discontent with the previous government, under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid, has catalyzed a rethinking of the country's foreign policy and its internal political landscape. Under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, who governed Bangladesh for over a decade, the country's foreign policy was largely seen as being aligned with Indian interests, a strategy that many in Bangladesh have come to view as compromising national sovereignty. The recent actions of the interim government, which replaced Hasina's administration, signal a clear shift toward a more independent course in regional diplomacy. The disillusionment with the previous government reached a boiling point after allegations of serious human rights violations against Sheikh Hasina and her associates. The ex-Prime Minister, charged in nearly 170 FIRs, stands accused of genocidal acts, political repression, and widespread corruption. Many of these charges center around her administration's handling of the Rohingya crisis, its controversial crackdown on political dissent, and alleged misuse of power to consolidate ties with New Delhi. With several close aides of Hasina now arrested, the interim government's decision to freeze the financial accounts of her family underscores the deepening public anger. Critics argue that Hasina's pro-India stance undermined Bangladesh's sovereignty and allowed Indian influence to creep into the country's political and economic decision-making processes. A crucial turning point in this recalibration of Bangladesh’s foreign policy came on October 6, 2024, when Chief Advisor Yunus inaugurated the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters. This event marked a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to strengthen the autonomy of Bangladesh's military, which had previously been seen as subordinated to Indian interests. The Army’s newfound emphasis on national pride is further reflected in recent legislative changes that have rolled back laws providing extra protection to the Mujib family, the political dynasty that has ruled Bangladesh since its independence. The public sees these moves as part of a broader push for reform, signaling the country’s intent to break free from external pressures, particularly from India. One of the most significant moves by the interim government has been inviting the UN Commission for Human Rights (UNCHR) to investigate allegations of human rights abuses during Hasina's tenure. The fact-finding team’s presence in Bangladesh is viewed by many as an opportunity to expose the abuses tolerated under the previous administration, which critics argue were facilitated by India’s tacit support. While the investigation unfolds, Bangladeshis are closely watching the interim government's handling of Sheikh Hasina’s family, including her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy. Wazed, facing severe allegations of corruption and misconduct, has hired the American lobbying firm Stryk Global Diplomacy to sway U.S. policymakers in an attempt to mitigate the political fallout and maintain his family’s international standing. The rupture in Bangladesh-India relations became even more apparent at the 79th United Nations General Assembly, where India expressed regret over Bangladesh’s request for a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Yunus. India’s reluctance to engage with its neighbor diplomatically underscores growing frustration in Bangladesh with India's perceived interference in its domestic affairs. Further aggravating matters, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) held a closed-door meeting strategizing support for the Awami League, Bangladesh's ruling political party during Hasina's reign. This move was seen as an attempt to influence internal politics in Bangladesh, and has contributed to the diplomatic rift. In retaliation, Bangladesh recalled its envoy from New Delhi, signaling its intention to distance itself from India’s regional dominance. As Bangladesh distances itself from India, it is looking to strengthen ties with Pakistan, its long-time regional counterpart. A recent diplomatic meeting between Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary and the Pakistani High Commissioner marked the beginning of a new chapter in bilateral relations. A follow-up Foreign Secretary-level meeting is scheduled for late November 2024, signifying a new commitment to regional cooperation. Bangladesh's removal of the 100% physical inspection requirement for Pakistani goods is expected to further facilitate trade between the two nations, signaling a thaw in what has often been a strained relationship since the 1971 independence war. The two countries are also working together to revive SAARC, a regional body that has long been sidelined due to political tensions, especially between India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has expressed strong support for SAARC's renewal, along with Nepal, suggesting a regional agenda focused on economic integration and collaborative growth. Perhaps the most hopeful sign of changing relations is Bangladesh's promotion of educational exchanges with Pakistan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has actively encouraged Bangladeshi students to explore academic opportunities in Pakistan, reflecting a growing desire for people-to-people connections. The moves by Bangladesh to assert its independence and realign with Pakistan also reflect broader regional trends. As India’s assertive regional policies increasingly face pushback, both Bangladesh and Pakistan are seeking to carve out a new space for themselves in South Asia. The push to revive SAARC could be a significant step in this direction, providing a platform for multilateral cooperation and economic integration. For Bangladesh, the road ahead appears to be one of reasserting sovereignty, breaking free from foreign influence, and promoting a vision of South Asia that is less dominated by any one power. Whether these ambitions can be realized, however, depends on navigating the delicate balance between regional cooperation and national autonomy. For now, Bangladesh’s diplomatic shift away from India and towards Pakistan appears to be a pivotal moment in the country's history, driven by a populace eager for justice, reform, and renewed sovereignty.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeL7e1CCfYEgtXJS0wx9yAF	2024-11-27T09:45:10-08:00	
A Renewed US-Pakistan Partnership To Counter Afghan Threats – OpE...	On November 19, the U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller addressed a question about Pakistan's security concerns under Afghanistan's Taliban regime, reiterating a critical point: 'We remain committed to engaging with government leaders and civilian institutions to identify opportunities to build capacity in detecting, preventing, and responding to threats posed by militant terrorist groups.' This statement is more than diplomatic rhetoric. It is a clear acknowledgment of the persistent and escalating dangers emanating from Afghan soil, underscoring the shared understanding between the United States and Pakistan that terrorism remains a potent threat to regional and global stability. The rise in cross-border attacks near the Durand Line and the brazen kidnappings of Pakistani security personnel paint a stark picture: Afghanistan, under the Taliban, is far from the bastion of order it claims to be. These incidents expose the operational prowess of militant groups like the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and others, which exploit Afghanistan’s territorial and administrative gaps to target Pakistan and potentially other regional actors. For Pakistan, these threats are not just a matter of border security but an existential challenge. The narrative that Islamabad’s concerns are overstated or politically motivated does not hold up against the grim reality of attacks that destabilize not just Pakistan but the broader region. The Taliban's refusal—or inability—to curb these groups within their borders is not only a testament to their waning control but also a dangerous signal to the world. Miller’s remarks also signal that Washington sees Pakistan as a pivotal ally in combating terrorism—a relationship with a long and complicated history. The collaboration between these two nations is evolving into a pragmatic partnership based on mutual necessity. While the U.S. may have withdrawn its boots from Afghan soil, it has not turned a blind eye to the evolving threats that Afghanistan poses to South Asia and beyond. The intelligence-sharing, capacity-building, and joint counter-terrorism initiatives that Miller alluded to could mark a new chapter in this fraught yet vital partnership. However, addressing these threats requires more than bilateral efforts. The international community must recognize that an unchecked Afghanistan is a breeding ground for extremism that transcends borders. The Taliban’s repeated denial of the presence of terrorist groups within their territory, despite mounting evidence, is a dangerous delusion. It emboldens these groups, further threatening the fragile peace in a region already on edge. Pakistan’s insistence on international attention is not mere posturing; it is a clarion call for collective action. Without sustained global pressure on the Taliban to fulfill their commitments under the Doha Agreement, which includes severing ties with terrorist groups, the region risks spiraling into deeper instability. The emerging collaboration between the U.S. and Pakistan is a step in the right direction, but it is only the beginning. The challenge now lies in translating diplomatic assurances into actionable strategies that can curb cross-border violence and dismantle the terror networks entrenched in Afghanistan. For too long, the global narrative around Afghanistan has oscillated between neglect and reactive engagement. It is time for a sustained commitment to addressing the root causes of extremism in the region. The U.S.-Pakistan partnership can and must serve as the cornerstone of this broader international effort. Ignoring the threats emanating from Afghanistan is not just a disservice to Pakistan or the region—it is a perilous gamble with global security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeL7e1CCfYEgipZhy_LzYj7	2024-11-27T09:43:47-08:00	
Spain’s Complex Demographic Reality – Analysis	By William Chislett In 2023 there were 100,000 fewer births and 43,000 more deaths in Spain than in 2013. There have been more deaths than births every year since 2015. But for the influx of immigrants the population would have declined substantially –instead it has increased from 46.6 million to 48.6 million–. Not only is the annual number of babies born continuing to decline, but the number of voluntary abortions increased dramatically last year. Now one pregnant woman in four opts for an abortion –in 2013 it was one in five–. These numbers (see Figure 1) underscore a complex demographic reality and present serious challenges. On the one hand, Spain’s average life expectancy (84 years) is the longest in the EU, thanks to a healthier life-style and an efficient public health system –it consistently scores among the top seven performers in most of the models–. Spain’s ageing population includes many centenarians –indeed, the oldest woman in the world was a Spaniard who died this year at the age of 117–. On the other hand, the fertility rate of only 1.16 live births per woman is way down on the 2.8 to 3 throughout the 1960-75 period and also far below the 2.1 at which existing population levels would be maintained. England’s fertility rate is down to 1.44, the lowest figure since records began in 1938. Figure 1. Births, deaths and voluntary abortions, 2013-2023 201320152017201920212023Births425,715420,290393,181360,617337,380322,098Deaths390,419422,568424,523418,703450,744434,114Births less deaths+35,296-2,278-31,342-58,086-113,364-112,016Abortions108,69094,18894,13199,14990,189103,097Abortions as % of pregnancies20.318.319.321.521.124.2Source: INE and Health Ministry. Spain’s baby boom (from the mid-1950s to the late-1970s) came later than in most other European countries and those babies are now either retired or in many cases about to be: over the next 20 years 14 million people are forecast to retire. The ‘baby bust’ that followed the baby boom means there might not be enough workers to replace them. The number of babies born in Spain last year was the lowest since records started in 1941: 322,098 compared with the 434,114 deaths. In order to keep the economy growing and sustain public finances, the alternatives are: boost employment, particularly for women; more immigration; higher taxes; lower pensions; delayed retirement; or reduced public services. The Socialist-led minority government seems to have opted for immigration and is hoping that a proposal to legalise the status of around 500,000 undocumented migrants will pass smoothly through parliament. If so, it would be the ninth such mass regularisation in some 40 years. The Bank of Spain forecast in April that, on current trends, Spain will need around 25 million more immigrants over the next 30 years. The current foreign-born population stands at 9 million (18% of the population). Spain is not the only country in which deaths outstrip births. Among the big EU countries, the same is also happening in Germany, Italy and Poland (see Figure 2), while for the first time since the 1970s the UK also recorded more deaths than births in the year to mid-2023. France is not (yet) in that situation, but even so President Emmanuel Macron has called, rather melodramatically, for ‘demographic rearmament’, as if his country was going to war. The number of Spain’s abortions last year is also striking: one abortion for every four pregnancies, a similar proportion to France’s but far higher than Germany’s and Italy’s one abortion for every seven pregnancies, and Poland’s one per thousand. Figure 2. Population, births, deaths and voluntary abortions in selected EU countries, 2023 CountryPopulation (mn) at 1/I/24BirthsDeathsAbortionsGermany83.4693,0191,027,916106,218France68.4678,511631,153232,000(2022)Italy58.9379,339660,60056,500Spain48.6322,098434,114103,097Poland36.6272,451409,036425Source: Eurostat and United Nations. The abortion figures reflect countries’ different laws. In Poland, for example, where the influence of the Roman Catholic Church is now strong, abortion has been largely outlawed since the 1990s after decades of permissive legislation during the communist era. Spain’s laws, however, have been gradually liberalised since 1985. Last year’s rise of almost 13,000 abortions in Spain is partly attributable to a change in the law enabling 16- and 17-year olds to have an abortion without parental consent. Spain’s abortion rate in 2023 was 12.22 for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44, up from 11.68 in 2022 and 10.46 in 2014. Just over 45% of women who had an abortion had used no form of contraception, a shocking figure. According to a survey published last month by the Spanish Contraception Society (SEC), 23.2% of fertile women hardly ever use contraception and almost 40% had used the morning-after pill, indicating that the real number of pregnancies avoided post- rather than pre-intercourse is much higher. The lack of protection is also seen in the alarming rises in gonorrhoea and syphilis –42% and 24%, respectively– between 2021 and 2023, according to the Instituto de Salud Carlos III. These figures are a sad reflection of the lack of sex education in schools, particularly the Roman Catholic concertados (State-subsidised private schools), which is a national disgrace. Figure 3. Fertility rates in selected EU countries (live births per woman) Live births per womanFrance1.79Germany1.46EU average1.46Poland1.29Italy1.24Spain1.16Source: Eurostat. Polls show that in principle couples would like to have more than one child. The main reason for not having more, according to the first-ever study on the issue by the state CIS pollster published last month, is ‘the lack of economic resources’ (see Figure 4). Figure 4. The main factors for having few children (%) %Lack of economic resources77.3Problems in reconciling work and life44.1In order not to limit professional opportunities26.4Because children are a big responsibility25.5Concern over the future that children will have23.7Because having the first child was delayed too long22.8Because of insufficient public aid20.6Source: CIS. As a result of the acute lack of affordable housing, in particular, Spaniards leave home on average at the age of 30 (EU average: 26). This, in turn, postpones couple formation and babies. The average age at which a woman has her first child is 31.6 years (EU average, 29.7 years). And many leave it even later, something that has made Spain’s fertility clinics a growth industry. Spain is now the EU country with the highest proportion of first-time mothers over the age of 40 (10.7% of births, double the EU average, and up from 6.8% in 2013). Maternity and paternity leave has been equalised (16 weeks at full pay), but much more needs to be done to encourage childbearing. These and other policies do not compensate for the lack of affordable housing (back in the 1970s, during the Franco regime, paternity leave was a symbolic one day). As a percentage of GDP, Spain’s family-benefits public spending is half that in northern European nations. Only Belgium, Denmark, Lithuania, Norway and Slovenia provide free childcare, something that Spain can only do if it raises more revenue from taxes. Unicef ranks Spain 20th out of 41 OECD and EU countries in childcare policies based on maternity and paternity leave, access, quality and affordability (see Figure 5). Figure 5.

As well as affordable, or better still free, childcare, work needs to be made more flexible and men should do more housework. There have been improvements in Spain in the latter two areas, but not enough. There’s a traditional Spanish saying to the effect that Todo niño nace con un pan debajo del brazo (literally ‘Every baby is born with a loaf of bread under its arm’). Unfortunately, nowadays more and more people seem to believe that a baby is in fact unaffordable.

It’s Time For The US To Bid Farewell To NATO – OpEd	By Alexander Coward In April 1949, as Cold War tensions between the United States and Soviet Union intensified, 12 nations came together to sign the North Atlantic Treaty, giving birth to NATO. The alliance was formed with a clear purpose: to provide collective defense against the looming threat of Soviet expansion. At that time, Europe was still reeling from the devastation of World War II, its economies in shambles and its militaries depleted. The US, triumphant in victory and solidifying its position as a global superpower, took on the mantle of protector, extending its military might across the Atlantic and halfway across Europe. Fast forward 75 years. The world has changed dramatically, yet NATO persists as a relic of a bygone era. The Soviet Union is no more, replaced by a Russia with a GDP smaller than Italy’s. The European Union, along with the United Kingdom, boasts a combined economy nearly ten times the size of Russia’s. France and the UK possess their own nuclear deterrents. Yet, inexplicably, US taxpayers continue to foot the bill for Europe’s defense. With Russia weakened, Europe is getting a free ride Some argue that Russia’s actions in recent years, particularly its invasion of Ukraine, justify the US’s continued NATO membership. They paint a picture of a resurgent Russian threat, echoing the Cold War narratives of the past. But this comparison falls flat when we examine the facts. During the Cold War, the US faced off against an empire of comparable might. The Soviet Union’s military and economic power posed a genuine threat to both Western Europe and US interests. Today’s Russia, however, is a shadow of its former self. With a GDP of about $2 trillion, it pales in comparison to the combined economic might of the EU and the UK, which totals more than $22 trillion. Moreover, the population demographics tell a similar story. Russia’s population is less than 150 million, dwarfed by that of the EU and UK totaling more than 500 million. The combined military spending of the EU and UK stands at $370 billion, far outstripping Russia’s total defense budget of $130 billion. Yet, despite these advantages, Europe continues to rely on the United States for its security. Ironically, the US’s persistent role in NATO may be making Europe less secure, not more. What matters for European defense isn’t raw might, but speed, agility and political will. NATO’s cumbersome decision-making process, requiring consensus among 32 members, is ill-suited to respond to modern threats. An army of motivated Polish and German fighters willing to fight and die to protect their freedom is a far greater deterrent to Russia than a US military that is truly awesome in its capabilities, but reliant on the whims of a foot-dragging US Congress for that to translate to the battlefield. The current arrangement doesn’t strengthen Europe; it weakens it, leaving the continent less prepared to address threats from Russia and elsewhere. While US citizens shoulder the burden of NATO’s defense spending, Europeans have grown complacent. They’ve built generous welfare states where they enjoy long vacations, early retirements and universal healthcare. Meanwhile, US workers struggle with rising healthcare costs, minimal paid leave and relentless anxiety about how they will pay the bills. This disparity is not just a matter of different priorities; it’s a direct result of Europe’s ability to skimp on defense spending, knowing full well that Uncle Sam will always be there to pick up the slack. It’s time to ask: Why should the US taxpayer subsidize Europe’s lavish lifestyle? A new era demands new priorities Proponents of NATO often point to the US’s nuclear umbrella as a critical component of European security. But this argument ignores a crucial fact: Both the UK and France possess their own nuclear arsenals, which was not the case when NATO was formed. These two European powers have more than enough nuclear capability to deter any potential aggressor. The idea that US nuclear weapons are necessary for European security is a Cold War anachronism that does not stand up to scrutiny. As we approach 2025, the world faces challenges that were unimaginable when NATO was founded. Climate change, cyber and biological warfare and the rotting minds of our children addicted to social media platforms like TikTok and video games like Fortnite are the true existential threats of our time. These are the battles that will define the 21st century and beyond, not a rehash of 20th century geopolitics. If there is a new Cold War between rival superpowers, it exists across the North Pacific, not the North Atlantic. It’s better for the US to leave Some will argue that leaving NATO is too risky, that it could destabilize Europe and embolden Russia. But this view underestimates Europe’s capabilities and overestimates Russia’s. By continuing its outdated commitment to NATO, the US is fostering dependency and resentment, preventing Europe from developing the military self-reliance it needs. Proponents of NATO often point to its invocation of Article 5 after the September 11 attacks as proof of the alliance’s value. However, this argument ignores a crucial reality: The response to the attacks would have happened with or without NATO. When faced with acts of aggression that demand a response, the United States has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to rapidly form and provide leadership to coalitions outside of formal alliance structures. The First Gulf War in 1991 serves as a prime example. In response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the US quickly assembled a coalition of 42 nations, many of whom were not NATO members. This 'coalition of the willing' included fighters from countries as diverse as Japan, New Zealand and Afghanistan. The swift and effective formation of this coalition underscores a fundamental truth: When genuine threats arise, nations band together to address them, which can be easier without the cumbersome framework of an organization like NATO. Game theory offers another compelling reason for the US to leave: the strategic value of unpredictability. In a world of mass surveillance where concealing actions is increasingly difficult, being predictable can be a significant disadvantage. Consider a poker game where one player always has a pair of kings, while the other has queens or aces with equal probability. Despite each player having the stronger hand half the time, the unpredictable player will on average win more. This principle applies similarly to military strategy. NATO’s rigid structure and well-defined protocols make its responses predictable. By leaving NATO, the US introduces an element of uncertainty that can serve as a more effective deterrent. Potential adversaries would no longer be able to rely on a known command and control structure or anticipate specific responses. This unpredictability can in turn force adversaries to be more cautious, preventing conflicts before they begin. Moreover, while it is true that P implies Q does not mean the same as not P implies not Q, there is often an implicit assumption that it does. By the United States declaring 'If there is an attack on a NATO country, there will be an overwhelming response from the United States' it suggests to potential enemies that 'If there is an attack on a non-NATO country, the United States will not respond with overwhelming force.' This is clearly seen in Ukraine, where Putin is in plain sight employing the principle: 'Ukraine not NATO, therefore Ukraine fair game.' The reality on the ground is that the Iron curtain no longer exists and we live in a world with fuzzy borders and hybrid warfare. The correct response to this is illustrated regarding Taiwan. Will America go to war to defend Taiwan? It might. That should be the answer to every question of that form. Will America go to war over a sabotaged undersea cable or gas pipeline? It might. Will it go to war over an act of terrorism? It might. Will America go to war to defend Europe? It might. America should go to war when the American President and Congress decide that it should, not because of a treaty from three quarters of a century ago born of a different age. By withdrawing from NATO, the United States would put Ukraine on equal footing with not just Poland but also France and Germany, and be a masterstroke of expanding not contracting American influence. In essence, by stepping away from NATO, the US would paradoxically enhance global security by keeping potential aggressors guessing about the nature and extent of possible responses to their actions. It’s time to go The time has come for bold leadership. President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide victory and Republican control of Congress provide a unique opportunity to reshape the US’s foreign policy. The nation must seize this moment to chart a new course. Leaving NATO will not only serve the interests of the US taxpayer, it will also help Europe by teaching it the pride of taking care of its own needs with its own hard work. The US’s departure from NATO won’t be easy. It will require careful diplomacy, detailed planning and time. But it is a necessary step for both the US and Europe to address the real challenges of the 21st century. And to those reading this in a nice coffee shop in a town square in Europe, I say this: If you want to continue enjoying your wine and your swimming pools, and your relaxed way of life, it’s time for you to fight for it — and pay for it — yourself.

The Maldives Presses Reset On Ties With India – Analysis	By Rishabh Yadav Maldivian President Mohammed Muizzu’s first state visit to India comes after a year of strained ties. He ran for president on an ‘India Out’ platform and, after coming to power, broke with the tradition of visiting New Delhi, instead visiting Turkey and, later, China. Muizzu finally met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the COP28 conference in December 2023 and visited New Delhi in June 2024 for the swearing-in ceremony of Modi’s third term. Muizzu’s recent visit promises to reset relations between New Delhi and Male, emphasising closer collaboration on development, trade, people-to-people ties and security. But regional geopolitics, domestic sentiment in the Maldives and India’s attitude towards its smaller neighbours may continue to be barriers. Since the Maldives’ democratic transition in 2008, two major groups — the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM)–People National Congress (PNC) coalition — have followed different approaches towards India. MDP governments under Mohammed Nasheed and Ibrahim Solih adopted an India-first approach in which New Delhi was the primary financial and security provider, but Abdulla Yameen’s PPM government intensified economic links with China and joined the Belt and Road Initiative. Maldives–India ties ruptured when Yameen asked India to remove its gifted helicopter and military personnel in response to New Delhi’s criticism of his crackdown on political opposition. The MDP under Solih recalibrated ties in 2018, with a focus on strengthening security partnerships and infrastructure projects. Yet Solih’s tenure also witnessed ‘India Out’ protests by the PPM–PNC coalition against New Delhi’s role in a naval dockyard project and broader military presence. The opposition accused the MDP of becoming a ‘slave of India’. Coalition leader Muizzu campaigned on an ‘India Out’ platform, promising to remove Indian military personnel and diversify security relations. After coming to power, Muizzu insisted India remove its 80 military personnel stationed on the island. Both countries reached a compromise by agreeing to replace the soldiers with civilian technical staff. The Maldives did not participate in the Colombo Security Conclave, a regional security dialogue, while also signing a security agreement with China and allowing a port call for a Chinese research ship. Relations further plunged after three Maldivian ministers made disparaging remarks against Modi, with matters escalating when Indian social media users called for boycotting the Maldives. Indian tourist arrivals fell from first to fifth position within a month. India also slashed aid to the Maldives by 48 per cent in its 2024 budget. Yet high-level exchanges between foreign ministers have begun to restore bilateral cooperation and reset ties. Muizzu then publicly denied pursuing an ‘anti-India’ agenda and labelled his approach ‘Maldives first’. India and the Maldives also held a defence dialogue to discuss defence cooperation projects and bilateral military exercises. India views diversification as limiting its own influence at the cost of China. But for Muizzu, diversification means engaging with different partners rather than subscribing to one, differentiating his coalition from its rival. Domestic politics demands Muizzu focus on growth. Facing an economic crisis, his recent diplomatic efforts have focused on easing the Maldives’ finances. The World Bank estimates the country’s public and publicly-guaranteed debt at US$8.2 billion — equivalent to 116 per cent of GDP — in the first quarter of 2024. US$1.37 billion and US$124 million of debt is in loans owed to China and India, respectively. The Maldives’ foreign exchange reserves have dropped to US$440 million, covering only 1.5 months of imports. These economic challenges have forced Muizzu to mend ties with India. The Maldivian government aims to restructure debt and settle trade in local currencies. It signed a cooperation agreement with Beijing, promoting financing through local currencies. India also stepped up its efforts by offering US$110 million of aid and contributing US$1.4 billion for infrastructure and development projects. India has also offered a currency swap worth over US$750 million. The decline of Indian tourists is another concern. Tourism is the Maldives’ largest industry, contributing 30 per cent of GDP and generating 60 per cent of foreign currency exchange. As of 22 October, India’s market share had plummeted to 6 per cent, down from 14 per cent in 2023. Muizzu has exhorted Indian tourists to visit the Maldives and highlighted opportunities for public–private partnerships in tourism ventures at the India–Maldives Business Forum. Muizzu’s policy shift is reflected in a document signed by India and the Maldives, transforming the bilateral relationship into a ‘Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership’. One notable change is intensified exchanges at the ministerial, parliamentary and local governance levels and institutionalising cooperation between national parliaments. This would allow both countries to have open communication channels across political party lines. This recalibration offers lessons to both countries. Muizzu has realised India’s geographical proximity makes it an indispensable development and security partner. And after regime changes in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, India is learning that investing in a single party or leader is not a prudent approach. The reset is a strategic gain for New Delhi as China strengthens its regional presence. Muizzu’s readjustment shows the difficulty of decoupling with New Delhi and how peddling anti-India populism subsides once an elected leader faces economic and governance challenges. Yet India should realise that small states are not without agency and may not view the region from its security lens. New Delhi’s best bet is to show its ability to be a reliable and accommodative partner through institutionalised mechanisms rather than a personalised approach to foreign policy. India should consider that while nationalistic fervour can be an electoral asset, it is a regional strategic liability.

US History Of Protectionist Tariff Train Wrecks – OpEd	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo Protectionist tariffs are associated with a long history of economic and social calamities in America. An important reason for this is that protectionist tariffs are a political tool of plunder and theft, and people don’t generally take kindly to being plundered and robbed. The only real difference between a lobbyist for protectionist tariffs and an armed robber is that the robber is armed. If the robber says 'Give me a thousand dollars or I will shoot you' it is obviously an act of armed robbery. The thousand dollars goes out of your pocket and into the robber’s pocket. If lobbyists for the automobile industry succeed in convincing Congress to pass a tariff increase on cars that results in the average car being $1,000 more expensive, then that thousand dollars goes out of the pockets of car buyers and into the pockets of the (unarmed) care sellers. As John C. Calhoun once sarcastically said, what protectionist tariffs 'protect' us from is lower prices. The First Tariff War In 1824 the protectionist forces in Congress, led by Kentucky hemp grower Henry Clay who wanted high tariffs on imported hemp, succeeded in passing a tariff bill that doubled the average tariff rate. Since most of the tariff increases on dozens of products applied to manufactured products from the North, it created a North/South divide on the issue. The agricultural South would be forced to pay more for shoes, clothing, woolen blankets and coats, farm tools, and other manufactured goods just so the Northern manufacturers could make even more profits. The South viewed it as purely an instrument of plunder and theft. Of the 107 House of Representatives votes in favor of the tariff only three came from Southern states. In the U.S. Senate there were 25 yes votes with only two from Southern states. Emboldened by this success, Clay and his protectionist compatriots, mostly from the North, increased the tariff rate even further in 1828 to an average of around 50 percent. It was called the 'Tariff of Abominations' by Southerners. South Carolina’s politicians called it 'a system of robbery and plunder,' which of course it was. They adopted the Jeffersonian tool of an ordinance of nullification that declared the act to be 'unauthorized by the Constitution' and was therefore 'null, void, no law, nor binding upon this State . . .' All tariff collection in South Carolina was suspended on February 1, 1833. Tariff collectors were to be fined and imprisoned for collecting tariff taxes and the legislature allocated $200,000 for the purchase of firearms with which to enforce tariff nullification. There was the threat of secession (which the New England Federalists had similarly threatened fifteen years earlier) with President Andrew Jackson blustering about an invasion to enforce the tariff. They eventually compromised and reduced the average tariff rate over the next ten years in order to avoid secession with the Compromise of 1833. As soon as that ten-year agreement was up, the same Northern cabal of protectionists, who had the votes in Congress, raised tariff rates again, with the 'Black Tariff' of 1842. That led to the first meeting in South Carolina to seriously discuss secession. The meeting took place in Bluffton, South Carolina, organized by South Carolina Congressman Robert Rhett, and was attended by some five hundred prominent South Carolinians who became known as 'The Bluffton Boys.' They once again considered nullification as well as secession. The 1843 meeting had nothing to do with slavery; it was to protest the plunder of protectionist tariffs. At the time all Americans accepted both nullification and secession as legitimate rights of citizens as a means of influencing and controlling their federal government. No one threatened to bomb Hartford and Boston into a smoldering ruin when the New England Federalists held their secession convention in Hartford in 1814. John C. Calhoun was a unionist who opposed the 'Bluffton Boys' so they neither nullified the Black Tariff nor seceded at that time. Rhett became known by some as 'the father of Southern secession.' The Second Tariff War On the eve of the Civil War the average tariff rate had declined to 15 percent, the lowest of the nineteenth century, but the recession of 1857 was used as an excuse to pass the Morrill Tariff during the 1859-60 session of Congress (prior to Southern secession), which would more than double the average tariff rate to over 32 percent. It was passed by the Senate and signed into law by President James Buchanan (D-Pennsylvania Steel Industry) on March 2, 1861, two days before Lincoln’s inauguration. Then when Lincoln gave his first inaugural address, knowing that the lower South had seceded and refused to pay any more tariff tributes to Washington, D.C., he used the words 'invasion' and 'bloodshed' to describe what would happen in any state that refused to collect and send to Washington, D.C. the newly-doubled tariff tax (which accounted for more than 90 percent of federal tax revenue at the time). He kept his word and invaded the Southern states in a war that was over tax collection fogged by his colorful rhetoric about 'saving the union.' Saving tariff revenue was his real admitted purpose. According to the latest research as many as 850,000 Americans died in Lincoln’s tariff collection war with more than double that number maimed for life. That number alone is more than all Americans who died in all other wars. (The official War Aims Resolution of the U.S. Congress (Crittenden-Johnson Resolution), by the way, stated that the purpose of the war was NOT to disturb 'the domestic institutions of states,' by which it meant slavery, but to 'save the union'). Lincoln raised tariff rates ten times, leaving the average tariff rate at close to 60 percent by the end of the war, where it would stay until the federal income tax was adopted in 1913. That’s forty-eight years of protectionist plunder and theft. Protectionist tariffs always discriminated against American farmers. High protectionist tariffs impoverish America’s trading partners who are then less able to purchase American goods, primarily farm goods. In addition to paying more for items upon which higher tariffs are placed, farmers also find that much of their foreign business has dried up. They are effectively taxed twice. A political deal was cut such that America’s farmers would support a federal income tax if, in return, the tariff rate was reduced, which it was. That was in 1913. Then when the stock market crash of 1929 occurred the protectionists in Congress naturally used it as an excuse to radically increase the average tariff rate. They did so with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, signed into law by President Herbert Hoover in March of 1930 despite opposition by over 1,000 economists. The stock market tanked and farmers were left with an income tax and the highest tariff rates ever. The Kill-the-International-Division-of-Labor Tariff The Smoot-Hawley Tariff increased tariff rates on over 800 items with an average rate of 59.1 percent, as high as it had ever been. Twelve countries immediately retaliated by placing high tariffs on American imports into their own countries, spawning an international trade war. By March of 1933 international trade by the seventy-five most active trading countries had shrunk from $3 billion/month to less than $.5 billion/month, an 83 percent reduction. This meltdown of world trade imploded the international division of labor and greatly exacerbated the Great Depression. Think about all this the next time you hear President Trump wax eloquently and lovingly about protectionist tariffs and threaten 200 percent tariffs on country after country, oblivious to the societal train wrecks that protectionist tariffs have caused throughout American history.

The New Futurism: What A Meloni-Musk Alliance Could Mean For Euro...	By Arturo Varvelli Last week, Elon Musk got a slap on the wrist from Italian president Sergio Mattarella, after he backed Italian prime minister Georgia Meloni’s policy of detaining foreign migrants in Albania. Musk had said certain Italian judges 'need[ed] to go' because they questioned the legality of the detainment policy. The US-based entrepreneur’s support for Meloni has been growing since he attended her annual party in Rome last year. In September, Musk awarded Meloni with the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen award in New York, reaffirming their mutual esteem. In turn, Musk has become a cultural reference point for the Italian right, particularly under Meloni’s leadership. For years, Italian conservatives have struggled to find intellectual and cultural touchstones to match the influence of left-wing thinkers and movements. Musk provides them with a figure who embodies a new kind of 'cultural futurism'. His embrace of technology, space exploration, and unfettered free speech offers the Italian right an intellectual sheen they have long sought. An icon for the Italian right In some ways, Musk echoes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the early 20th-century Italian poet and founder of the Futurist social movement. Both figures managed to capture the imagination of their respective eras with bold visions of technological progress and societal disruption. Marinetti’s Futurism was a rallying cry for speed, innovation, and a break with the past – ideals that aligned closely with the early Fascist movement’s desire for radical transformation. Similarly, Musk’s ventures in electric cars, space exploration, and social media have positioned him as the new standard-bearer of technological progress, appealing to those who see the future as a realm of limitless potential. Just as Marinetti’s Futurism provided the early Fascists with a cultural framework for their revolutionary zeal, Musk’s hyper-technological vision offers Meloni and her allies a blueprint for their own aspirations. Musk could be both a liability and an asset for the Italian far-right. On the one hand, his focus on innovation could help drive European technological sovereignty. His electric car company, Tesla, is in talks with Rome about substantial investments in Italy, particularly in energy and automotive technology, which align with Meloni’s focus on boosting the country’s industrial base. On the other hand, his unpredictable nature could introduce instability, especially since his views diverge from mainstream European policies. Foreign policy implications The personal rapport between Musk and Meloni could have significant implications for Italy’s foreign policy. Both share hardline migration stances and see unchecked migration as a destabilising force. Musk’s social media could amplify views that align with Meloni’s rhetoric, potentially swaying public opinion in Italy and beyond. This could push the European Union into adopting even stricter border policies, a key goal for Meloni’s government. One of the most pressing concerns is how Musk’s influence might shape Italy’s stance on the war in Ukraine. Meloni has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, but Musk has courted controversy with a proposal to cede territory to Russia as part of a peace plan. His proposal could resonate with parts of Meloni’s base that are sceptical of prolonged engagement in the conflict. If Musk were to advocate for a more isolationist approach, for example, by suspending satellite internet services in Ukraine to encourage Kyiv to reach a settlement, it could embolden factions within Italy that wish to reduce support for Ukraine. Without Italian support, Europe would be in an even weaker position. The Meloni-Musk relationship could also shape Italy’s ties with the United States. With Donald Trump in the White House, Rome’s close relationship with Musk could become a double-edged sword. Meloni could leverage her rapport with Musk and Trump to secure favourable bilateral deals, such as reducing tariffs on Italian exports. However, there is a risk that she might lean too heavily on these personal relationships, adopting a self-serving transactional approach rather than pushing for a united European front. A wiser course The shrewder strategy for Meloni would be to use her influence to build a strong European consensus, particularly in defence and technology policy. For example, instead of pursuing bilateral deals with the US that could fragment the EU’s negotiating power, Italy could take the lead in shaping a European response to the next administration in Washington. This would involve coordinating with France and Germany to form a cohesive strategy on issues ranging from China to digital sovereignty. However, Meloni’s nationalist inclinations may make it difficult for her to prioritise European unity over immediate national gains. She is more likely to fight for Italian products than Europe. In times of populism, any US tariffs on Parmigiano Reggiano would be a domestic failure for her. For these reasons, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen should collaborate with Meloni on US policy – precisely because of the Italian prime minister’s close links to Musk and US Republicans. If Meloni, von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte united, the EU would be in a stronger position. These three non-leftist personalities could earn Trump’s trust, easing collaboration with the new US administration. Simultaneously, a united European front could give them an edge in negotiations with Washington. The Meloni-Musk partnership symbolises a new kind of futurism for the Italian right, one that seeks to redefine progress through the lenses of technology and national strength. However, for this vision to translate into tangible benefits, Meloni will need to balance her domestic priorities with broader European goals. Failure to do so could isolate Italy within the EU, turning a potential strategic advantage into a missed opportunity.

US Government Starts 2025 Fiscal Year Deep In The Red – OpEd	The U.S. government got off to a very bad start for its 2025 fiscal year. The U.S. Treasury Department reported that the federal government spent $257 billion more than it took in as revenue in October 2024. That is the second-worst figure ever recorded for the first month of the fiscal year. Only October 2020 has seen a bigger deficit. Of course, October 2020’s deficit of $284 billion happened during 2020’s coronavirus pandemic. That was when government-mandated lockdowns shut down much of the U.S. economy. Those lockdowns shrank the U.S. government’s tax revenue by billions while it spent billions to compensate for their negative impact. That’s what it took to make the worst-ever start of a fiscal year for the U.S. government in the modern era. There is no pandemic in October 2024. At $327 billion, the federal government’s tax collections are 37% higher than in October 2020. However, the U.S. government’s spending totaled over $584 billion, 12% higher than it spent in October 2020 during a national emergency. The Treasury Department used the chart below to illustrate the U.S. government’s revenues, spending, and deficit for October 20: The first month of the 2025 fiscal year follows a full year of excessive spending that delivered the federal government’s largest annual deficit since the pandemic. The budget results for October, the first month of the 2025 fiscal year, come after President Joe Biden’s administration turned in a full-year fiscal 2024 deficit of $1.83 trillion, the largest outside the COVID-19 era. Today, there is no national emergency that justifies the federal government spending so much money in October 2024. The pandemic effectively ended years ago. Why on earth is the U.S. government still spending money like the pandemic never ended?

Musk’s Aim To Create A ‘Super-Government’ In The US – Analysis	By Zhou Chao After the dust settled from the U.S. Presidential election, President-elect Donald Trump unexpectedly established an independent department outside the federal government system, namely the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump referred to it as 'the Manhattan Project of our time', with the goal to 'dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies'. The original Manhattan Project was a program started by the U.S. Department of the Army in 1942 to develop the atomic bomb. This time, Trump intends to 'blow up' what he describes as the corrupt government bureaucracy. The department even carries a patriotic mission, planning to deliver a smaller, more efficient government to America as a 'gift' on the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. After the department was announced, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were selected to lead it. Ramaswamy suggested reducing the federal workforce by 75% and expelling the children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. In September, he proposed laying off government employees based on their social security numbers and firing odd-numbered ones to halve the workforce. Musk recommended a 77% reduction, shrinking 428 federal agencies down to 99. On the other hand, he called on 'high-IQ small-government revolutionaries' to join this new government via X. Commentators are largely pessimistic about the department’s prospects, believing that its ambitious goals will be difficult to achieve. Some argue that the complexity of government governance is far greater than that of corporate governance and that the relevant experience in the latter is difficult to be effectively applied in the former. Therefore, the attempts by Musk and Ramaswamy are doomed to fail. Others point out that the practical scope of the DOGE department is very limited. Ramaswamy proposed cutting federal government spending by USD 2 trillion or more. However, the operational expenses of federal government departments account for only 1% of all fiscal spending, so even if these were completely cut, it would still fall short of the target. Reason magazine analyzed that the DOGE department’s operational space may be focused on expenditures that the federal government should not be involved in to begin with. For example, reducing federal grants to state governments, which accounted for 35% of state spending in 2023; or cutting the Pentagon’s budget, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office's deficit reduction plan, could save USD 995 billion over ten years. It could also prioritize cutting subsidies and tax incentives for the private sector, including preferential treatment for aerospace, semiconductor, clean energy, electric vehicle, and healthcare companies. However, in reality, the space for these actions is also limited. After all, in recent years, the flexibility of the U.S. federal government's fiscal maneuvering has been shrinking. According to China’s Donghai Securities' report U.S. Fiscal Policy: History and Trends, the U.S. government's mandatory spending in the 2024 fiscal year, which does not require Congressional approval, accounts for 73%, including statutory expenditures for social security, Medicare, defense, and nearly 13% for interest payments. Discretionary spending, which requires Congressional approval, only accounts for 27%, roughly USD 1.858 trillion. This portion includes spending on defense, education, environmental protection, infrastructure, and other areas, which cannot be entirely eliminated. In contrast to the widespread view, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan pointed out a unique possibility that many commentators and media outlets have failed to fully grasp regarding the establishment of the DOGE department and Trump's true thinking. Trump hopes to leverage Musk's capabilities to create an efficient 'super-government' to stand out among government institutions worldwide. The efficiency of such a government would resemble corporate management, which is why he enlisted Musk to take charge. The view that corporate management experience is largely inapplicable to the government sector is difficult to defend. Both in the U.S. and throughout world history, there have been many instances where corporate management practices were successfully applied to government operations. During the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, the U.S. government brought in many entrepreneurs to reform government operations, and the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, was formerly the president of Ford. The most successful example came during the Bill Clinton administration. Faced with bloated federal agencies, high budget deficits, inefficiency, and public services that were costly without yielding results, the Clinton administration, led by the Democratic Party, extensively borrowed successful practices from large private companies in terms of organizational downsizing, process simplification, and customer orientation, implementing three major reforms during its tenure. The first was to reorganize and reduce administrative programs and agencies. The principle was to determine what the government should and should not do based on the agency's mission. Following this principle, administrative programs were merged, reorganized, and reduced, leading to a streamlined administrative structure. The second was a major overhaul of rules and regulations. In 1995, President Clinton issued a series of directives on regulatory reform, requiring federal management agencies to abolish outdated and unnecessary rules, reward employees based on results rather than bureaucratic formalities, and change the long-standing focus on whether procedures were violated. From 1995 to the end of 1996, the federal government eliminated 16,000 pages of unnecessary federal rules that hindered the effective operation of public affairs and abolished a total of 640,000 pages of internal rules within various agencies. The third effort focused on reshaping government culture. During President Clinton's second term, transforming the administrative culture of federal agencies became a key focus in reshaping government. The goal was to create a new administrative culture that was results-oriented, performance-based, and customer-centered. The eight-year restructuring of the federal government has yielded significant results. In 1992, the U.S. federal budget deficit reached a staggering USD 290 billion, but by fiscal year 1998, it had turned into a surplus. Between 1993 and 2000, the restructuring involved cutting 426,200 federal civilian jobs, including 78,000 middle-management positions, making it the smallest federal workforce since the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration (1953–1961). In the present day, the government of Argentina under President Javier Milei is another example of success. After taking office, Milei significantly reduced public spending by billions of dollars, slashing the number of government ministries from 22 to 9, cutting over 30,000 public sector jobs, halting all infrastructure projects, and even closing the state-run television network. These actions helped to ease the fiscal burden, bringing Argentina's inflation rate down from over 300% to 2.7% by October of this year. The country also overcame a severe budget deficit, with its sovereign credit rating upgraded by two notches to CCC. Foreign exchange reserves saw a net increase of USD 19 billion this year. As investor confidence in the Argentine market grew and a plan to forgive depositors' debts was implemented, the government successfully attracted nearly USD 20 billion in dollar deposits back into local banks. At the same time, the Milei government successfully avoided street protests caused by a surge in poverty by protecting and even expanding certain welfare programs, with the strengthening of fiscal capacity being an important foundation. This allowed the government to effectively address the short-term spike in poverty rates. In fact, even the World Bank now believes that the worst period for Argentina has passed. Therefore, corporate management experience can indeed be applied to government operations, but previous U.S. administrations did not persist in doing so due to their own limitations. Furthermore, for the DOGE Department, the primary goal of layoffs or spending cuts is not just about reducing personnel or cutting expenses, but rather about improving efficiency. Over the past 15 years, inefficiency within the U.S. government has become increasingly apparent. In the field of aerospace launches, inefficiency and high costs have even led the U.S. to depend on Russia for long-term space launches, while the inefficiency of U.S. infrastructure has also been widely recognized. As for Elon Musk, there are several notable characteristics of his management practices: 1. Strong emphasis on first principles (focusing on the fundamental nature of things and the core issues of a problem); 2. Skilled at using technology and efficiency to reduce costs, not relying on monopolies to inflate prices, nor on establishing a stable banking system as the financial foundation. Musk's companies primarily use technology to lower costs in competitive markets. 3. Minimize intermediary steps in processes as much as possible; 4. Accelerate cycle times. The job posting on the DOGE Department's X platform account stated that candidates must have exceptionally high IQs and be willing to work over 80 hours a week, focusing on the monotonous task of cost reduction, with zero compensation. It is clear that Musk and his team’s approach is to focus on the department's core business, selecting the most competent and passionate individuals to take on the work, maximizing the abilities of the right talent, and aiming for fewer people handling multiple roles rather than many people handling one. They do not consider additional factors like ethnic diversity when recruiting, nor do they intentionally seek to hire minorities. After Musk acquired Twitter, he drastically reduced the workforce from 8,000 employees to 2,000, yet Twitter's operations did not collapse, and everything continued normally. At SpaceX, after a successful rocket launch, the key team members in the celebratory photo were few in number. Musk achieved what NASA had failed to do. This remarkable increase in efficiency shows how such reform logic, once implemented, could comprehensively improve the efficiency of the U.S. government at all levels, enhancing its ability to advance and implement policies. With efficiency improvements, many aspects will be fully driven forward. With a focus on efficiency, the U.S. government’s requirements for government procurement will become more detailed and stringent, and cost audits will be more rigorous and thorough. This will force government contractors to actively reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance service quality. The cost of government procurement is also expected to decrease further, significantly increasing the likelihood of achieving government spending reduction targets. After improving efficiency and reducing expenses, the government will be able to free up more fiscal space to subsidize the truly needy and vulnerable social groups, further lowering the time costs for the public. There will basically be no situation where, as some people believe, a sharp reduction in social welfare for the public. As for concerns that the government’s power structure might significantly constrain the Trump administration, while these worries are not without basis, they still seem somewhat exaggerated. First, in this election, the Republican Party achieved a nearly sweeping victory, successfully gaining control of both houses of the U.S. Congress. Trump's almost crushing victory over Kamala Harris has made him a hero of the Republican Party. Even before and after the election, many prominent Republican figures defected, significantly strengthening the 'Trump-centric' unity within the party. Second, the Democratic Party still holds significant influence and will almost certainly interfere with Trump's subsequent governance and attempt to block his policies. However, in this election, due to dissatisfaction with the economy and illegal immigration, the Democratic Party's long-time stronghold, namely the minority groups, showed clear signs of division. A large number of Black and Latino voters shifted their support to Trump and the Republican Party. In order to maintain its main voter base, the Democratic Party may have to compromise on a series of issues with the Republicans and Trump, weakening its ability to oppose them. Third, the U.S. President holds executive power, and reforms within the President's authority are carried out within his own team and administration. With Trump's support, the likelihood of Musk and others successfully advancing reforms is high. The eventual result could lead to a 'super-government' unlike anything else in the world, resembling Tesla's 'Gigafactories'. As a political legacy of Trumpism, it could have a profound impact on the operation of the U.S. government. Final analysis conclusion: The 'super-government' that Musk aims to build will be characterized by extremely high efficiency, which will bring about a series of positive changes on multiple levels. The improvement in efficiency is remarkable, and it will place immense pressure on governments around the world, as it will be difficult to compete with such a model. Although many of Trump and Musk's ideas are still just concepts or drafts at this stage, Trump's term is only four years, and both he and the Republican Party will likely focus more on deeply implementing 'Trumpism' and solidifying its political influence. Their desire to do so will be strong and resolute. The traditional establishment in the U.S. will find it much harder to divert Trump's attention, as it did during his first term.

The Mainstream Media’s Big Lie – OpEd	Eduardo Porter joined the chorus of people telling us that the inequality of the last four decades was just the result of the free market in his Washington Post column. As Porter puts it: 'A paper last year by economists from Princeton and Columbia argues that Democrats started losing the working class back in the 1970s, when they bought into the notion that the government should let market forces rip, dropping the New Deal approach of improving workers’ lot via strong unions, job guarantees, minimum wages and protectionism — and instead assisting the economy’s losers via taxes and transfers.' He then argues that this is the source of the rise in working class support for authoritarianism. The problem with this line is that we did not let market forces rip. Government-granted patent and copyright monopolies are not the f**king market. They are hugely important in the economy, likely shifting more than $1 trillion a year ($8,000 a family) from the rest of us to those in a position to benefit from these monopolies. Higher drug prices are the most visible transfer, but these monopolies also add hugely to the price of a wide range of other items like computers, software, smartphones. Then we also have government support for the financial industry. This was most visible during the financial crisis when the government directly saved many of the largest financial corporations in the country from bankruptcy. There are many other supports for the financial industry, such as deposit insurance, which are less visible. This sector is the source of many of the largest fortunes in the economy. We also have rules of corporate governance that allow CEOs and other top executives to rip off the companies they work for. This allows hugely bloated pay at the top which comes at the expense of ordinary workers. These rules are not 'letting the market rip.' They are written by politicians who get campaign contributions from top executives. Also 'free trade' has never meant free trade in highly paid professions like physicians’ and dentists’ services. If these highly paid professionals were subject to the same sort of competition as autoworkers and textiles workers their pay would be considerably lower, and healthcare would be cheaper for the rest of us. I go into these issues in more detail in my book Rigged (it’s free), but the basic point should be clear. There is a widely repeated lie that inequality was driven by the natural workings of the market. The reality is that politicians of both parties worked to structure the market to bring about more unequal outcomes. The media and most of the academic establishment actively push this lie at every opportunity. And people are pissed. To be clear, I’m sure that almost none of them know anything about patent policy or the rules of corporate governance. They just know that the rules are structured against them, and they are absolutely right. And elite outlets like the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Atlantic won’t let anyone make this obvious point in the spaces they control. This article first appeared on Dean Baker’s Beat the Press blog.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-sLHTWZQzrvG	2024-11-26T16:59:41-08:00	
The Magic Number Is 2.5 In The UK – OpEd	In Europe it can be 2.0 or 2.5, while in the US it’s somewhere between 4 and 6 Those numbers in the above headline are the percentages of Gross Domestic Product that each country’s government and politicians figure needs to be spent on the military annually in order to be 'safe' from potential Russian aggression. Just to give readers a 'sense' (if such a term can be applied to the concept of defense by percentages of national economic activity), that 4- 6% 'safety' figure for the US represents an the share US GDP that military spending in the 2022 fiscal year represents. In FY2022 the actual dollar figure for he total military budget was somewhere between the $768.5 billion which the Office of Management and Budget reports went directly to the Pentagon and all the armed forces branches under its jurisdiction, and the $1.58 trillion figure which also includes all the military spending that goes to other agencies like the NSA, CIA, Energy Department (nuclear arsenal), NATO, Veterans Affairs, etc. and interest on the national debt for America’s wars. Now think about this for a moment. The world is currently at the edge of a precipice like the sheer face of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park portrayed above as the US has been prodding and provoking Russia over Ukraine now for a decade, threatening to bring that former soviet of the old USSR into NATO. Once Russia invaded Ukraine to prevent such a thing from happening right on it’s eastern border, Washington has been providing advanced weapons as well as satellite intelligence to the Ukrainian military to help it kill Russian soldiers. Most recently, the provocations have reached the scary point of providing Ukraine with longer-range missiles which can strike deep inside Russia itself to hit military targets and key infrastructure like rail centers and oil depots. Britain, America’s faithful poodle, has joined in this dangerous game by providing its own longer-range cruise missile the Storm Shadow. Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin has responded by accurately declaring as 'acts of war' the escalatory actions by the US and UK in supplying these new weapons to Ukrainian troops, training them in how to use them, and providing them with the use the precise geolocation data from US military satellites necessary for successful guidance to targets inside Russia . He followed this up by openly changing Russia’s rules for the use of nuclear weapons to include targeting any nuclear powers that provide non-nuclear powers with the weapons to attack Russia. Certainly anyone can understand the logic of that change. If Russia were for example to give Cuba or Venezuela missiles that could strike Florida or the US Gulf Coast and one of those countries were to start firing them at US targets, and Russia began flying in or shipping in more rockets, would the US refrain from attacking Russia, or its planes and ships and limit itself to bombing Cuba or Venezuela? Of course not! To make matters even worse, after d Putin sent a powerful message by ordering the firing of a new Russian hypersonic strategic missile with a range of over 3000 miles to hit a city in central Ukraine with six independently maneuverable warheads. The missile, which Putin said was a 'test,' took 15 minutes from its launch site in central Asia to reach the target \city of Dnipro. The explosions there were relatively small and involved conventional explosives, but the point was made that the same warheads are designed to carry nuclear bombs. Putin pointedly said that the UK itself or any country providing weapons to Ukraine to strike targets in Russia, not just Ukraine itself, could be targets of Russian missiles like this new one called the Oreshnik. The Pentagon confirmed that it has no anti-missile system that could defend against this new Russian missile. Okay, so what is all this nonsense about assigning percentages of GDP for military spending that are supposed to assure the safety of the US and the nations of NATO Europe all about? If Russia has nuclear missiles that cannot be stopped, how is increasing the percent of GDP spent on a country’s military got anything to do with keeping the country 'safe'? There has been no word fromBiden’s White House or British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s No, 10 Downing Street about reversing the permission granted to Ukraine to use UK and US-supplied longer range rockets to hit deep inside Russia, as Ukraine has just. done. No word either on whether more such missiles will be supplied to Ukraine, as that country’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for. If this fraught situation doesn’t sound insane, I don’t know what does.. Here’s the situation: Russia’s over-confident army was initially bloodied by Ukrainian forces backed with US and NATO supplied weapons, but eventually its much larger military figured out how to deal with those weapons and it has been steadily degrading Ukrainian forces, who have reportedly suffered 500,000 casualties and are losing ground daily. The US and UK missiles, unless supplied in vast quantities, will not turn the tide of battle, yet even if the small number currently n Ukrainian hands are used they could spark a Russian strike on Ukraine’s main government buildings in Kiev or even the huge US embassy compound there (the US Embassy was evacuated a few days ago because of fears that could happen). Then where are we? (It’s an act of war to deliberately attack a country’s embassy.) Wars Have often begun small but then grow in tit-for-tat escalations. When nuclear weapons are added to that equation the time between steps on the upward-moving stairway can occur very quickly, as generals look at an opponent’s missiles, and their own and wonder if they hold their fire whether they will find their own missiles struck before they can launched, leaving them at the mercy of the enemy’s nukes. Given that risk, in a crisis a leader or even local commander could easily decide that if 'use it or lose it' is the operative situation, launching first is the safest bet. And then it’s game over. Full scale nuclear war is on. And all those percentage-of-GDP spending won’t have accomplished a damned thing. The absurdity of it all was highlighted today as it was reported that Britain’s PM Starmer, after approving the launch of a British Storm Shadow missile by Ukraine into Russia, said Britain, which is facing a budget crisis at present that has it cutting winter heating subsidies for poor people, has 'no defense' against a Russian missile attack, but that he would boost Britain’s military spending, despite the budget crisis, from 2% to 2.5%. Would such a spending boost offer protection? Not when designing and building a whole new generation anti-missile system takes years and with no guarantee of success. All he’s doing is offering magical thinking to the anxious masses. The proper response to this current situation is to call a halt to escalation in Ukraine and negotiate an immediate cease fire between Russia and Ukraine with negotiations for an end to that to commence at the same time. The idea of defense budgeting by percent of GDP has been idiotic from the outset. After all, GDP actually shrank during the recent Covid-19 pandemic, which automatically made the existing military spending a larger percentage of each country’s total economic activity, but with no gain in national security of course. This kind of numerical nonsense would never be permitted if the budget were about education or healthcare spending. It’s only in the area of national security where huge parts of the spending is kept secret, hidden in black boxes like the CIA budget. And it turns out that all that $1.58 trillion the US is spending on 'defense' (sic) isn’t making us or the world any safer. In fact it appears to be putting us in the greatest danger humanity has been in since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, except that back then we had a brilliant man, John F Kennedy, who knew when to fold ‘em and backed away from a nuclear war by secretly agreeing to remove nuclear tipped Jupiter missiles the US had provocatively placed just inside Turkey’s border with the Soviet Union — the whole reason Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev started setting up nuclear missiles in Cuba in the first place. Now we have a brain-addled lame-duck President Biden with only weeks left in his White House tenure threatening us all with nuclear war in an attempt to leave office saying he 'stood with Ukraine.' That’s 100% nuts!

Ironic Dependency: Russian Uranium And The US Energy Market – OpE...	Be careful who you condemn and ostracise. They just might be supplying you with a special need. While the United States security establishment deems Russia the devil incarnate helped along by aspiring, mischief-making China, that devil continues supplying the US energy market with enriched uranium. This dependency has irked the self-sufficiency patriots in Washington, especially those keen to break Russia’s firm hold in this field. That, more than any bleeding-heart sentimentality for Ukrainian suffering at the hands of the Russian Army, has taken precedence. For that reason, US lawmakers sought a ban on Russian uranium that would come into effect by January 1, 2028, by which time domestic uranium enrichment and conversion is meant to have reached sustainable levels. The May 2024 Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, signed by President Joe Biden as law H.R.1042, specifically bans unirradiated low-enriched uranium produced in Russia or by any Russian entity from being imported into the US. It also bars the importation of unirradiated low-enriched uranium that has been swapped for the banned uranium or otherwise obtained in circumstances designed to bypass the restrictions. At the time, Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm struck a note of hollering triumphalism. 'Our nation’s clean energy future will not rely on Russian imports,' she declared. 'We are making investments to build out a secure nuclear fuel supply chain here in the United States. That means American jobs supporting the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to a clean, safe, and secure energy economy.' This does not get away from current circumstances, which see Russia’s provision of some 27% of enrichment service purchases for US utilities. The Russian state-owned company Rosatom is alone responsible for arranging imports of low-enriched uranium into the US market at some 3 million SWU (Separative Work Units) annually. Alexander Uranov, who heads the Russian analytical service Atominfo Center, puts this figure into perspective: that amount would be the equivalent of the annual uranium consumption rate of 20 large reactors. Given this reliance, some legroom has been given to those in the industry by means of import waivers. H.R.1042 grants the Department of Energy the power to waive the ban in cases where there is no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium available to enable the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or US nuclear energy company and in cases where importing the uranium would be in the national interest. The utility Constellation, which is the largest operator of US nuclear reactors, along with the US enrichment trader, Centrus, have received waivers. The latter also has on its book of supply, the Russian state-owned company Tenex, its largest provider of low-enriched uranium as part of a 2011 contract. No doubt knowing such a state of play, Moscow announced this month that it would temporarily ban the export of low-enriched uranium to the US as an amendment to Government Decree No 313 (March 9, 2022). The decree covers imports 'to the United States or under foreign trade contracts concluded with persons registered in the jurisdiction of the United States.' According to the Russian government, such a decision was made 'on the instructions of the President in response to the restriction imposed by the United States for 2024-2027, and from 2028 – a ban on the import of Russian uranium products.' Vladimir Putin had accordingly given instructions in September 'to analyse the possibility of restricting supplies to foreign markets of strategic raw materials'. The Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom confirmed that the ban was a 'tit-for-tat response to actions of the US authorities' and would not affect the delivery of Russian uranium to other countries. In a Russian government post on Telegram, the ban is qualified. To make matters less severe, there will be, for instance, one-time licenses issued by the Russian Federal Service for Technical and Export Control. This is of cold comfort to the likes of Centrus, given that most of its revenue is derived from importing the enriched uranium before then reselling it. On being notified by Tenex that its general license to export the uranium to the US had been rescinded, the scramble was on to seek a specific export license for remaining shipments in 2024 and those scheduled to take place in 2025. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Centrus warned that any failure by Tenex 'to secure export licences for our pending or future orders […] would affect our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results in operations, and competitive position.' While Tenex had contacted Centrus of its plans to secure the required export licenses in a timely manner, a sense of pessimism was hard to dispel as 'there is no certainty whether such licenses will be issued by the Russian authorities and if issued, whether they will be issued in a timely manner.' The sheer, sweet irony of it all.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-lohquz_oOlm	2024-11-26T16:45:58-08:00	
Russia Lacks Icebreakers Its Arctic Fleet Needs To Function In Ea...	Russia has more icebreakers than any other country, something it celebrates and that most other countries see as guaranteeing Russian dominance in the region. Most of these ships, however, are small and diesel, rather than nuclear, powered and lack the most advanced electronics and are incapable of helping ships far from the Russian coast (see EDM, November 25 [1], [2]). This means that Moscow’s ability to keep the Northern Sea Route (NSR) operational year-round is still far from guaranteed, and Russia faces particularly serious difficulties in the route’s Eastern portion and to its North (see EDM, June 12, 2023). These areas are now cooling rather than warming, given the irregular pattern of climate change, undercutting Moscow’s ability to trade with China and, more generally, advance its expansive claims to the Arctic seabed (The Barents Observer, August 6; AANII, August 8). Moscow’s challenges with its shortage of deep-sea icebreakers have become increasingly evident. This is underscored by its much-ballyhooed icebreaker construction program, which Russian experts acknowledge is unlikely to materialize in the near future. Additionally, Deputy Commander of Russia’s Northern Fleet Vice Admiral Oleg Golubyov recently admitted that ships in the eastern Arctic often drift at night to avoid sea ice or the risk of running aground in poorly surveyed areas. This occurs because they lack the necessary icebreaker escorts to operate safely 24 hours a day (IAREX.ru March 31; Profile.ru, November 9; Arctic Today, November 22). Such a danger is very real and was highlighted several years ago when a large number of ships, civilian and naval, were trapped in the ice for weeks (The Barents Observer, November 9, 2021; Window on Eurasia, December 30, 2021). Golubyov’s admission is indicative of Russia’s often ignored problems with the NSR, the Arctic Ocean more generally, and its fleet of icebreakers. In an interview with that fleet’s newspaper, Na Strazhe Zapolyarya, Golubyov says that this year, ships under his command encountered heavy sea ice in the Eastern Arctic waters between Wrangel Island and the Russian Federation as well as beyond toward the Bering Strait. Lacking icebreaker support, these Russian naval vessels had no choice but to drift at night and move only when the two helicopters accompanying them could survey a safe route forward during daylight hours. Neither he nor others want to rely on such an arrangement and it is one that Moscow hopes to overcome by building more icebreakers, despite all suggestions that global warming will make that costly exercise unnecessary. Such problems are compounded, Golubyov continues, by the fact that in the region, much of the seabed remains unmapped and shallow waters can trap ice, posing particular dangers to ships. The Russian admiral’s words call attention to environmental issues in the NSR that are all too often ignored. While global warming has left the Western half of the NSR ice-free for most of the year, the situation in the Eastern half is very different. In fact, temperatures have cooled in recent years, and ice has become a larger problem (Profile.ru, May 31, 2022; The Barents Observer, November 16, 2022; Window on Eurasia August 8). To counter the cooling temperatures, keep the NSR open and trade with China flowing, and allow Russia to project power far into the Arctic, Moscow has announced an ambitious program of icebreaker and ice-capable ship construction (see EDM, September 11, 2018, September 4; Profile.ru, May 31, 2022; East Russia.ru, August 1, 2022). Longstanding and intractable problems in its shipbuilding branch, including corruption and the impact of sanctions, and cutbacks in government financing as a result of the war in Ukraine, however, means that Russia is unlikely to be able to build anything close to the number of needed vessels, Moscow experts say (Kommersant, October 12, 2023; EDM, December 12, 2023;Window on Eurasia, April 4). All the more so due to the development of its shore-based support facilities along the NSR, which has nearly stopped (see EDM, September 11, 2018, June 4, 2022). This has created a new geo-economic and, therefore, geo-political situation, as far as icebreakers and the Eastern Arctic are concerned. While Russia maintains a dominant position internationally, as far as icebreakers are concerned, its dominance is increasingly a facade more than real. On the one hand, most of its icebreakers are smaller and capable of handling ports but not open sea routes, as Golubyov acknowledges. On the other, Moscow is increasingly concerned with keeping the Eastern Arctic, where ice remains and even is currently on the increase, and thus needs more icebreakers to maintain trade with China and lend credence to Moscow’s expansive claims to the Arctic Ocean and its mineral-rich seabed (see EDM, October 29, 2019). Both these claims and the kind of difficulties Golubyov’s remarks suggest Moscow is facing in the eastern Arctic, however, are leading other countries to consider building more icebreakers of their own and be in a position to challenge Russia in the future. Among those doing so are Canada, Finland, the United States, and China (The Barents Observer, July 10, July 12; TRT Russian, July 15; see EDM, November 25). All of them can see that Russia is overextended as far as icebreakers are concerned, not only keeping vessels in service long after they should be scrapped but also failing to meet deadlines for building new ones (Window on Eurasia, July 18). The Russian dominance that intimidated them earlier is now dissipating (see EDM, June 12, June 26, 2019). Among these countries, the one that has made the most rapid progress is China, which has not only built more icebreakers in recent years than any of the others but, even more importantly, has significantly reduced the time it needs to construct each of them (see EDM, July 23, 2020). For now, Moscow hopes that China, its ally against the West, will help it maintain its presence in the Arctic, given Chinese interest in Russia’s use of the NSR. Russian officials fear that at some point, China will assume a dominant position in the Arctic and be able to elbow Russia aside (see EDM, July 12, 2018, June 12, 2019, March 6, 2021, February 1, 2022). That is all the more likely in the coming years, given that Moscow experts say that Russian yards will not be able to build anything compared to the number of ships, icebreakers in particular, that Moscow needs to maintain its current status (Window on Eurasia, July 18). Russia’s inability to reliably send ships through the ice in the Eastern Arctic is a clear sign of the beginning of a major geopolitical shift. Western governments will have little choice but to deal with it if they do not take timely action and expand their own icebreaker fleets as well.

Israel Reaches Ceasefire With Hezbollah In Lebanon	Israel agreed late Tuesday to a ceasefire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon that could end more than a year of fighting by early Wednesday when the truce takes effect. Even as Israel’s military bombarded Hezbollah targets in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a national television audience that he would urge his Security Cabinet ministers to approve a ceasefire, which they did a short time later. The United States, along with France, played a key role in brokering the settlement. At the White House, President Joe Biden called the ceasefire 'a critical step … to end the violence' in the Mideast. He said that Iran and its proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas militants in Gaza, 'have paid a heavy price' in more than a year of fighting Israeli forces. He said the Israeli-Hezbollah agreement 'is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.' But Biden warned, 'Let me be clear, if Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and pose a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense consistent with international law, just like any country in facing a terrorist group pledged to that country's destruction.' The outgoing U.S. leader, with less than two months remaining in his four-year term, said that with Hezbollah agreeing to end its attacks on Israel, 'Hamas has a choice to make. Their only way out is to release the hostages [it is holding in Gaza], including American citizens.' 'Over the coming days, the United States will make another push for Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza,' Biden said. He said that the Israel-Hezbollah agreement showed that 'peace is possible.' Netanyahu said he favored a truce with Hezbollah so Israel could focus its attention on the broader threat Iran poses to the Jewish state, refresh its forces and supply of munitions and isolate Hamas in its ongoing fight against Israel in Gaza. Netanyahu vowed that if Hezbollah renews its attacks on Israel or rearms itself, Israel would immediately resume its bombardment of militant sites in Lebanon. 'The length of the ceasefire will depend on what happens in Lebanon,' Netanyahu said. 'With the full understanding of the United States, we are preserving full military freedom of action — if Hezbollah breaks the agreement and seeks to arm itself, we will attack.' Netanyahu’s move toward a halt in nearly 14 months of fighting with Hezbollah came after hours of Israeli bombardment of militant targets in Beirut’s southern suburbs. The Israeli attacks targeted 20 buildings that the military said were Hezbollah strongholds, warning noncombatant residents living there to flee to safety and maintain a distance of at least 500 meters. It was the largest number of buildings targeted in a single day where the Israel Defense Forces warned residents about an impending attack. The airstrikes sent billowing clouds of dark smoke into the sky over the Lebanese capital. At least 10 of the strikes were simultaneous, in what the Israeli air force described as 'a widespread attack.' The attacks appeared to be a last attempt by Israel to gain the upper hand in its war with Hezbollah, since Netanyahu, even before speaking to his countrymen, had signaled he was open to a ceasefire. The militants began attacking Israel in October 2023 in support of Hamas militants fighting their war with Israel in Gaza. The Cabinet-level talks occurred at the Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv. The ceasefire deal, brokered by U.S. and French diplomats, would halt the fighting and start a 60-day period in which Israel and Hezbollah would withdraw from southern Lebanon. Ahead of the deal, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a news conference at a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Italy that the ceasefire was 'the best way to guarantee there is peace, there is stability.' Blinken said the deal to end Israel-Hezbollah fighting also could push Hamas to reach a long-stalled ceasefire pact in Gaza because it would no longer have an Iranian-funded ally fighting Israel on a second front in northern Israel and Lebanon. Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces are obligated to retreat south of the Lebanon-Israel border, while Hezbollah moves north of the Litani River. The plan calls for the Lebanese army, which is not involved in the Israeli-Hezbollah fighting, to patrol the region between the two warring sides. Even as Netanyahu said he favored the deal, it was not clear whether some of his far-right colleagues in the Israeli parliament would go along with the proposal. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem suggested last week that the militants would agree to a truce if Israel stopped attacks on Lebanon and Lebanon retained its sovereignty. But difficulties remained in reaching a ceasefire, such as how Hezbollah’s withdrawal from the border area would be monitored. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell had earlier in the day called on Israel to agree to the ceasefire, saying there are 'no more excuses.' Speaking to reporters ahead of the G7 meeting, Borrell said a ceasefire is 'absolutely necessary' for civilians displaced by several months of intensified fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. The G7 comprises the world’s leading industrialized democracies. Borrell expressed hope that Netanyahu’s government would approve a ceasefire on Tuesday without seeking to add additional stipulations that could delay or derail an agreement. 'No more excuses. No more additional requests. Stop this fighting. Stop killing people. And let’s start thinking on peace,' Borrell said. U.S. officials expressed hope Monday that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was close. Speaking to reporters during a press call, national security spokesperson John Kirby described recent talks in Beirut led by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein as 'constructive,' adding, 'We believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction.' In New York on Monday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said negotiations toward a ceasefire are 'moving forward' but have not been 'finalized.' He added that Israel would retain the ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement. 'We will make sure that we will have the ability to neutralize any threat that will not be dealt [with] in southern Lebanon. I hope that the Lebanese army will take care of that in the future, but if they will fail, again, we will be there,' Danon said. Meanwhile, Lebanon's deputy speaker, Elias Bou Saab, said there are no major obstacles to implementing a ceasefire deal. A five-nation committee, chaired by the United States and including France, will oversee the ceasefire process, according to Bou Saab. The fighting in Lebanon has caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing hundreds of thousands. On Monday, the United Nations World Food Program announced that it has provided emergency aid to more than a half million people in Lebanon since the conflict began. The WFP said it plans to reach 1 million people and is continuing to work to deliver critical assistance to affected communities. In the October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the Middle East warfare, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,235 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters, while the Health Ministry says more than half are women and children. The United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries designate Hamas and Hezbollah as terror groups.

Sudan: RSF Accused Of Widespread Sexual Violence	Sexual violence against women and girls of all ages is rampant in war-torn Sudan, including rape, gang rape, forced marriages and sexual slavery. A new United Nations report found that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia is using sexual violence as a deliberate tactic 'intending to terrorize civilians.' 'The majority of rape and sexual and gender-based violence was committed by the RSF,' the report, published on October 29 by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan, stated. '[It’s] part of a pattern aimed at terrorizing and punishing civilians for perceived links with opponents and suppressing any opposition to their advances.' Mission Chair Mohamed Chande Othman said women and girls in territories under RSF control are victims of what amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 'The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering,' the Tanzanian lawyer said in a statement. 'The situation faced by vulnerable civilians, in particular women and girls of all ages, is deeply alarming and needs urgent address.' Since fighting began in April 2023, Sudan’s brutal civil war between the army and the RSF has killed tens of thousands of people and forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes in the world’s largest displacement crisis. The U.N. report revealed a pattern of gender-based violence by the RSF as its fighters have advanced in several Sudanese states, particularly in Khartoum, Darfur and El Gezira. Several women have taken their lives in central El Gezira state after being raped by RSF fighters, according to rights groups and activists. 'The RSF started a revenge campaign in areas under the control of [former RSF general] Abu Kayka,' Hala al-Karib, head of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (Siha), told the BBC. 'They looted, killed civilians who were resisting and raped women and little girls.' While documenting gender-based violence in Sudan over the course of one week in late October, Siha confirmed three cases of suicide by female victims of sexual violence in El Gezira state, Karib said. According to the U.N. report, sexual violence also has taken place during attacks on shelters for internally displaced people and on civilians fleeing the fighting.The report said that the RSF committed sexual crimes 'with particular cruelty' in western Darfur, including the use of 'firearms, knives and whips to intimidate or coerce the victims while using derogatory, racist or sexist slurs and death threats.' 'First-hand sources informed of rape of girls as young as 8 years and women as old as 75,' the report stated. Although the Sudanese Armed Forces also has been accused of sexually abusing civilians, the U.N. report said that the RSF was responsible for 'sexual violence on a large scale.' It also said the RSF and allied Arab militias have carried out 'abduction, recruitment and use of children in hostilities.' Nigerian scholar and advocate Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, one of the U.N. fact-finding mission’s three experts, said the RSF is destroying lives with impunity and must be held accountable. 'These women, girls, boys and men in Sudan who are increasingly exposed to sexual and gender-based violence need protection,' she said in a statement. 'Without accountability the cycle of hatred and violence will carry on.' Othman said the situation continues to deteriorate and underscores the need for urgent protection of civilians. 'Ways must be found to create conditions for the immediate deployment of an independent protection force,' he said. 'There is no safe place in Sudan now.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-tjmfSxqyDz7	2024-11-26T16:23:53-08:00	
Myanmar: Wa Rebels Reject Thai Demand To Withdraw From Bases Alon...	Ethnic rebels in eastern Myanmar’s Shan state on Tuesday dismissed calls by the Royal Thai Army to withdraw from nine military camps along a disputed portion of the border with Thailand, suggesting Bangkok take the issue up with the ruling junta. The United Wa State Army, which controls an autonomous region of Shan state, has designated the townships of Tachileik, Mongsat, Mongton, Hway Aw and Pong Par Kyin -- near Thailand’s Mae Hong Son province -- as part of its '171 Military Region.' Leaders of the Wa army, or UWSA, met with officers from the Thai Royal Army in Chiang Mai, Thailand from Nov. 18-19 to discuss tensions along the border, after which Thai authorities demanded that the rebels withdraw from the nine military outposts by Dec. 19, according to Thai media reports. On Tuesday, the UWSA responded to the demand, saying troops withdrawals must be decided as part of official bilateral talks. 'This is a matter of negotiation for the two governments,' said UWSA liaison officer Nyi Rang, referring the issue to Myanmar’s ruling junta, which seized power in a February 2021 military coup d’etat. UWSA officials said tensions between its forces and the Thai military are highest along the border with Shan’s Mongton and Mong Hsat townships. Beginning Monday, the Royal Thai Army has been reinforcing its troops in the area, further stoking the border spat, a resident named Aung Kyaw told RFA Burmese. 'At present, no clashes have occurred, but troops on both sides remain in a standoff,' he said. 'It is hoped that conflict can be avoided to prevent any loss of life or property. The situation should be resolved peacefully.' Aung Kyaw said that residents of the area are concerned by military preparations on both sides of the border. Long-running dispute The areas under dispute between Myanmar and Thailand were previously under the control of Myanmar’s ethnic Mong Tai Army. However, amid conflict between Myanmar’s army and the Mong Tai army, the former deployed allied Wa forces to the areas, according to observers of ethnic issues in Myanmar. Following a 1989 peace agreement between Myanmar’s military and the UWSA, more than 80,000 ethnic Wa people migrated to eastern Shan state, and the Wa forces established strong military bases along the Thai border, observers say. Than Soe Naing, a commentator on military and political affairs, told RFA that the UWSA will not leave these stronghold areas, with a population that now numbers more than 100,000 within its 171 Military Region. 'The UWSA has established positions in this area with the approval of former Major General Khin Nyunt of the Myanmar military to block the Mong Tai Army from importing supplies from Thailand,' he said. 'The UWSA is unlikely to relinquish these disputed areas quietly, despite Thailand’s demands for their withdrawal. If Thailand carries out military action, clashes between the two neighboring countries are inevitable.' Several Myanmar and Thailand governments have attempted to resolve the long-running dispute along the two countries' shared border, with little success. Thailand made similar demands to the UWSA during a township-level meeting in Tachilek in June 2023, which the Wa army also dismissed. But the stakes are higher this time around, with Bangkok issuing a deadline and the Royal Thai Army deploying reinforcements to the border. Attempts by RFA to contact the Thai Embassy in Yangon via email received no response by the time of publishing. Thailand downplays tensions Despite the rising tensions, Col. Rungkhun Mahapanyawong, the Royal Thai Army’s 3rd Army Region spokesman, described the situation at the border as 'normal.' 'The situation along the borders of [Thailand‘s] Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son remains normal - people are living their lives as usual and the [parties] along the border have good relations with one another,' he said at a press conference at the Royal Thai Army’s 3rd Army headquarters in Phitsanulok province. 'The reported areas are not yet demarcated,' he said. 'Government-to-government negotiations are ongoing.' However, he warned that Thailand will protect its national sovereignty if necessary. 'The 3rd Army Region is ready to do its best to defend the nation’s sovereignty and protect the Thai people,' he said. Attempts by RFA to contact junta spokesperson Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun for a response to UWSA reports of territorial disputes went unanswered Tuesday. Junta unlikely to engage A former military officer turned political commentator told RFA that the junta has little interest in the disputes between the UWSA and the Thai government. 'This border dispute is not even equal to one hundredth of the importance of friendly relations between the two countries,' said the former military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. 'The [junta] ... is preoccupied with internal affairs, so they aren’t interested in this dispute and won’t address it.' Tensions with Thailand come as the UWSA faces pressure from Beijing to end hostilities with the junta amid conflict at the border China shares with northern Shan state. Other Myanmar political commentators told RFA they believe that in renewing its demands on the longstanding territorial disputes, the Thai government is taking advantage of a time when both the Myanmar military and the UWSA are dealing with internal conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-lxAoQP4mfPS	2024-11-26T16:21:37-08:00	
US Hastening The Shift To A Multipolar World – OpEd	By Osama Al-Sharif Nothing speaks of the US applying double standards when it comes to respecting international law and UN bodies than its reaction to the International Criminal Court’s issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on war crime charges. The Biden administration was quick to reject the ruling, arguing lack of jurisdiction by the court. President Joe Biden called the decision 'outrageous.' But Republican lawmakers were more belligerent, with Sen. Lindsey Graham threatening America’s allies, such as Canada, the UK, France and Germany, that if they were to cooperate with the court’s ruling, the US would crush their economies. Others called for a bipartisan resolution sanctioning the court and its prosecutor. Graham said that the US would be next on its list if the International Criminal Court was not sanctioned. This contrasts with the US and Graham cheering the court when it issued arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudan leader Omar Bashir. The world has been moving slowly from a unipolar to a multipolar reality for years. But Israel’s horrific war on Gaza has accelerated that process. The US has weakened the UN Security Council by exercising its veto power on multiple occasions to derail draft resolutions calling for an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza. The fact that many so-called Western liberal democracies defended Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, with some remaining unapologetic today, has strained the rules-based order to breaking point. There are clear indications that Israel’s horrific military conduct in Gaza under the guise of self-defense has had significant geopolitical implications that can be seen in the erosion of America’s status as the world’s sole superpower. This position was achieved following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the world is deeply polarized again. The Global South no longer sees the West as the defender of universal values and the rule of law. Israel has put itself above the law, but what has made its exceptionalism, as a lawbreaker, the norm is America’s blind support and blatant partiality even before the war on Gaza. For years, the US, which had appointed itself as the exclusive broker of a political settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, looked the other way as Israel expanded its illegal settlements in the Occupied Territories, demolished Palestinian homes, killed and imprisoned thousands and imposed an apartheid regime on millions of Palestinians under occupation. Moreover, it used its power in the UNSC to derail any move to hold Israel accountable before the law. Under the Trump administration, the US went even further by unilaterally recognizing Israel’s illegal annexation of East Jerusalem and Syria’s Golan Heights. By doing so, the US itself became a rogue state, violating international law and becoming culpable in Israel’s war crimes. In the coming months and years, it is almost a done deal that the US will give the go-ahead for Israel to annex the West Bank, and maybe Gaza as well, and kill any prospect for a Palestinian state. All this would be illegal under international law and UN resolutions. In addition to the diverging international response to the war on Gaza, with the US today standing almost alone in its explicit support of Israel’s actions, Washington’s indifference to the position of its allies has diminished its moral authority and diplomatic influence in certain regions, particularly the Middle East and the Global South. The war has exposed limitations in the current UN system, particularly the Security Council, potentially accelerating calls for reform to better reflect a multipolar world order. Countries like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India and Turkiye are echoing such calls. The US has been losing its global hegemony for a number of reasons, such as the meteoric rise of China as an economic and military power, the birth of new Global South coalitions and blocs, such as BRICS and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the emergence of regional powers like Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Indonesia. Furthermore, the increasing global reach of non-Western cultural influences and media is challenging the dominance of traditional Western soft power. The proliferation of diverse media sources and social media platforms has challenged traditional Western-dominated narratives about global conflicts, reflecting a more multipolar information landscape. It is not only America’s global dominance that is eroding. The EU is seeing an unprecedented shift in public sentiments toward the far right, which is dominated by euroskeptics, anti-immigration populist figures and Islamophobic policies. These political undercurrents will weaken the bloc’s global influence as it faces existential challenges. In the Middle East, countries are distancing themselves from confrontational American policies, such as Washington’s rivalry with China and Russia. This is evident in Saudi Arabia’s opening to Moscow and Beijing, while maintaining a close working relationship with the US based on what best serves its national interest. Turkiye and Iran are also keeping all lines open as they forge new alliances based on the shared interests of the neighborhood. The shift toward a multipolar world is a reality that coincides with the eclipse of US global hegemony and Trump’s 'America First' policy. As America turns inward, its global dominance will diminish. Moreover, its audacious challenges of the rules-based order will accelerate the drive toward a collapse of the post-Second World War entities that the US helped build. But the path toward a multipolar world remains fraught with challenges. Unresolved conflicts will test the existing global system, while new ones may pave the way for the birth of fresh alliances and platforms of regional cooperation.

Interview: Could A Demilitarized Zone End The Ukraine War?	By Vazha Tavberidze (RFE/RL) -- Lieutenant Colonel Jahara 'Franky' Matisek is an active-duty U.S. Air Force officer, a former command pilot, instructor, and Bronze Star recipient, and a professor in the national security affairs department of the U.S. Naval War College. He has researched and written widely on issues of technology in future warfare, hybrid warfare, and security force assistance. In a conversation with RFE/RL's Georgian Service, Matisek talked about the state of the Russian invasion at the 1,000-day mark and whether the United States has really done all it can for Ukraine. He also floated the notion of a huge demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Belarus. And he said Kyiv's surprise cross-border incursion in Kursk already called 'B.S.' on Moscow's threat of a nuclear response to invasion. Matisek's views are his own and do not represent the official position of the U.S. military or the U.S. government. RFE/RL: Roughly 1,000 days into Russia's full-scale invasion, where do we stand in the Ukraine war? How is it looking? Jahara 'Franky' Matisek: In some ways, it's looking worse, in other ways, it's looking better. The things I would say are looking better are that you have more European unity on training and equipping Ukrainian forces. I would also contend that the U.S. has actually been quite lackluster in the training of Ukrainians, that we've only trained about 20,000. So any perceptions that the U.S. is doing everything for Ukraine, it just isn't true. I would argue that there is also concern about what the next [U.S. President-elect Donald Trump] administration might be doing in regard to the Ukraine war. And if we must put on our 'doomcasting hat' about where this is looking more negative, it is obviously the insertion of North Korean troops into the war. That adds another element. The question becomes: Is this just a limited insertion of 11,000 North Korean troops? But when you start hearing rumors that the North Koreans may end up giving Russia up to 100,000 troops, that's highly concerning because, through the course of the war, Russia seems to be running out of viable manpower to do effective combined-arms maneuvers and have a well-trained and well-equipped army to carry out current operations. So they have to rely on 'meat-wave' assaults (operations with large numbers of troops with little regard for individual survival), and the meat-wave assaults work as long as, from a Russian perspective, those people were disposable anyways. You know, it is very telling about how they work: They basically force the Ukrainians to expose their defenses and positions to take care of the meat-wave assault. Meanwhile, the Russian VDV [Airborne Forces], who are obviously comparatively better than most Russian forces, are able to then use precision fire over time to basically slowly pick off Ukrainian defenses. Again, the negative is that the Russian war machine continues to grind on. They are still taking more territories, especially in eastern Ukraine. And there is a big question mark as to whether Moscow has achieved its war aims of undermining Western political support for keeping this war up into the third year, especially as we don't know what the incoming Trump administration is going to do. RFE/RL: With all that in mind, in this theater of war, which act are we watching, and how far are we from the grand finale Matisek: If you're [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in Moscow, you obviously want to exploit this sort of lame-duck presidency [of outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden]. So you could argue it's quite good that the Biden administration finally relented on allowing longer-range strikes [by Ukraine] into Russian territory. And the Ukrainians have already launched several ATACMS [ballistic missiles into Russia]. The range of the ATACMS is only about 300 kilometers.... RFE/RL: Isn't it a fallacy to refer to them as long-range? They are distinctly short-range. We're not talking about Tomahawks here. Matisek: Well, for the [U.S.] Army, 300 kilometers is a long-range weapon system. But you're 100 percent right, long-range for the army means something very different from the navy or the air force. I'm an air force pilot, so when I think 'long-range,' I think I can hit anything on the planet from wherever I am. I like to use the term 'anti-strategy' for the narrative that the U.S. basically got cornered into allowing long-range missiles and deep strikes into Russia when it's 300 kilometers. You can drive that in a few hours; that's not long-range if it's a day trip. So the fact that we even allowed ourselves to get into that debate -- self-defeating, self-deterring, loop or spiral or cycle, whatever you want to call it -- is really unfortunate because, again, it gave the narrative to Putin, which he obviously seized upon. He just released a new, updated Russian nuclear doctrine. The two biggest things he did in there were [to assert that] any conventional attack on Belarus is now considered an attack on Russia. And the other thing I found very notable is the inclusion of verbiage -- essentially it's directed at Ukraine -- about a country attacking us with the support of a nuclear power -- so that's potentially the U.S., the French, the Brits -- we consider that also within the realm of a response with nuclear weapons. I think it's 'red line' bluffing, because the U.S. and the collective West have been crossing Moscow's red lines for the last three, four years. But it's an attempt to control the narrative and to signal to the West that 'Hey, you can't touch this because we've now drawn the line [whereby] your participation in this war, the very act of it, makes you culpable in a potential nuclear war.' RFE/RL: In that case, they don't need to wait for another escalation by 'the West.' By that Russian logic, the United States is already involved and is therefore a potential target for a nuclear strike. So what are they going to do to implement it? Matisek: Well, I don't think it's any change because Russia already had a nuclear doctrine that if their territory is invaded they're allowed to have a nuclear response. Well, the Ukrainians already demonstrated that that was a line of bullshit. So I don't think the Russians are using a nuclear weapon anytime soon. The Russians can talk, they can rattle the saber about this all they want, but in the end, it would actually do more harm to the Russian war machine. It would hurt them even more, it would make them more isolated. The rest of the world is going to judge the actions of Moscow and them using a nuclear weapon when the survival of the Russian state and Russian leadership is not at stake. RFE/RL: If we could return to the second half of the previous question: How close are we to an endgame, provided the current trends continue and assuming no Trump intervention happens? Matisek: I could see this going on another three years. RFE/RL: Looking at the battlefield, is there still a case to be argued in favor of Ukraine winning this on the battlefield, retaking all its territory and driving Russians out, or has that ship sailed? Matisek: If I were to cast this into a campfire metaphor: Imagine a big campfire, and if the campfire is the standard of retaking Luhansk and [the rest of] Donbas and Crimea, the chances of that happening are merely a warm ember, and the fire is mostly out. So it does not look good, given current trends, things that I do believe could change -- that would be the European Union sending an EU-flagged mission into Ukraine and drawing a line in the sand, saying that 'Russian forces will not cross these lines because we view this as an invasion of Europe.' RFE/RL: How likely is that, given what we've seen from Europe? And curiously enough, one of the peace plans that emerged from President-elect Trump's camp actually includes creating a demilitarized zone and manning it not with U.S. but European troops. So now, without a hint of sarcasm, how realistic is it that Europe says yes to that? Matisek: The idea of the Russian forces eventually making it to Kyiv or farther west over the next three to five years would compel the Europeans to do that, along with the Americans telling the Europeans, 'You have to do this.' And there is a model for this; it is basically how North Korea and South Korea had to be essentially split up. Is that a best ideal outcome? No, of course the best ideal outcome is all Russian forces leaving the entirety of Ukraine. But we have to go back to being realistic. How much are the Americans and the Canadians and the Europeans willing to fight and die for every centimeter of Ukrainian territory? And that becomes a question of political willpower and domestic politics. I think it's just an easier sell having to lock this in place. And you essentially create a huge DMZ [demilitarized zone], essentially between Ukraine and Belarus, Russia, and the occupied parts of Ukraine. And that would just basically be millions of land mines and Ukrainian defense bases, with probably European Union-flag forces essentially as observers, peacekeepers, and as a part of that sort of deterrent line. It would essentially become just one big trip-wire deterrent, if you will. That would be an ideal outcome for a lot of countries, especially in Europe. It's really depressing and unfortunate, but it's hard to make that case to the average American or average European, that this war is worth actually fighting and dying for. It's worth fighting for, yes, but… RFE/RL: Dying for it is a different matter. Matisek: Exactly. RFE/RL: We are talking hypotheticals now, right? If that plan became a reality, somebody would have to man the DMZ, right? It couldn't be only Ukrainians. Matisek: It would have to be a European Union-flag mission. NATO would not want to be charged with that type of mission. RFE/RL: Because of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty, providing for common defense in the event of an attack on any member]? Matisek: Yes. RFE/RL: Then we enter the very murky territory of who would actually be willing to send troops there. And further, equally murky territory would be what happens if there is any sort of renewed military conflict and those troops get in harm's way? Matisek: So, on the first point, I would argue that most Eastern European countries are willing -- the Baltics would be willing to send forces, and Poland for sure -- and then it becomes kind of murky after that. I would argue the French would probably be willing to do it, and I bet the Germans would also be willing to do it. And I would argue we already kind of know who'd be willing to do this, because a template kind of exists: NATO has the EFP, the Enhanced Forward Presence, in the Baltics already, a sort of trip-wire deterrent force. RFE/RL: But they are very conveniently under the NATO umbrella. These ones wouldn't be. Matisek: Yes, but, for the sake of argument, there is enough overlap between the EU and NATO, they could use an EFP, they could borrow part of the EFP construct. And I would contend that you would probably get a similar mix of forces from the EU in addition to the Canadians and the Brits and even Norwegians, I bet. RFE/RL: Since we are discussing armies and, to an extension, manpower: Which is the more pressing issue for Ukraine at this stage, shortage of equipment or shortage of manpower? Matisek: It's manpower, manpower, manpower. The Europeans and the Americans and the Brits, all these countries that are willing to train Ukrainians, they could train more; it's just a question of whether Ukraine can send more. And get them enough military-aged men and women, as women are also allowed to serve in the Ukrainian Army. So that becomes a huge part. We know it's in Germany's interest not to allow Ukraine to fall either; I think a big report came out just last week about the anticipation that, if Ukraine were to fall or be abandoned, that Europe would expect 10 million to 15 million Ukrainian refugees and that would be way more disruptive economically and politically. So, yeah, it's manpower. The only thing you can do to offset the manpower things is having more and more drones. Because they don't have the manpower, you really see the Ukrainians emphasizing cheap drones that are unjammable, that use AI, and that is a way to overcome the manpower issue. But at a certain point, you still need people on the ground to man the drones. RFE/RL: We have already discussed the ATACMS green light from the United States. Let's circle back to it. What has shifted in the Biden administration's calculations that made them think that now is the time? Matisek: Oh, it's definitely that the administration has been under a lot of pressure because of the insertion [into Russia's Kursk region] of the 11,000 North Korean troops. They've been under a lot of pressure, I think, internally and externally, about letting the North Koreans get involved in this war without any sort of tit-for-tat-type response. The South Koreans are quite upset and angry about this as well. So this had to be a natural response. RFE/RL: The general consensus seems to be that it's coming way too late, but still the question needs to be asked: What's the expected impact? Matisek: Again, the tit-for-tat escalation by the current administration has just been too little too late, constantly. That seems to be a theme -- too little, too late, too much open debating, too much time to give Russia an ability to adjust before these weapons and stuff are used so that you can't exploit them in the moment. I guarantee you, Russians did their best to disperse after that announcement, in terms of massing formations and trying to get things out of stockpiles, just to minimize how much damage can be done by ATACMS. So that's what I find unfortunate about it, that the U.S. is trying to incrementally escalate but do it very openly, and that actually undermines the intent and the purpose. And honestly, this is still a war, so when you do things like this, it makes it feel more like a war of politics and diplomacy than an actual war of militarily defeating Russia and neutering their ability to invade a neighbor ever again.

Indonesia Considers Repatriating Foreign Drug Convicts; President...	By Tria Dianti Indonesia is weighing a 'humanitarian' plan to return incarcerated foreign drug convicts to their countries to serve their remaining sentences, with the president initially approving the transfer of the 'Bali Nine' heroin traffickers back to Australia. Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia’s new president, initiated the plan to send home foreign drug prisoners on a case-by-case basis, a law ministry spokesman told BenarNews. Human rights advocates praised Indonesia for first agreeing to return death-row Filipina Mary Jane Veloso, and then the remaining members of the 'Bali Nine,' named because the nine Australians were arrested while attempting to smuggle more than 16 pounds of heroin out of the Indonesian island in 2005. However, some criticized Prabowo for agreeing to the Australians’ return saying it undermined the Indonesian justice system, while others hoped the plan was a true attempt at reform. Ali Nurdin, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s Ministry of Law and Human Rights, said compassion played a central role in the decision to transfer Veloso and the five Australians to their home countries. 'One reason for this policy shift is the humanitarian aspect. The mothers of these inmates are elderly and cannot frequently travel here,' Ali told BenarNews. He said the ministry was reviewing their return to ensure it complied with regulations. Law Minister Supratman Andi Agtas, however, told reporters on Monday that a mechanism for the transfers was already being worked on. 'It could be ready by December or early next year,' he said. 'But in principle, the president agrees with this and we are preparing it.' Prabowo’s spokesman and advisers did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BenarNews. Indonesia has some of the world’s harshest drug laws and faces a growing drug abuse problem with an estimated 3.6 million users, according to a 2022 state report. Prabowo’s predecessor, Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, declared a 'drug emergency' and during his two terms oversaw the executions of 18 drug convicts by firing squad, including two 'Bali Nine' members. These executions were carried out despite international criticism and appeals for clemency. Filipina Veloso was scheduled to be executed with the two 'Bali Nine' members in 2015, but her execution was postponed at the last minute after Manila requested that her case be reviewed. Veloso was convicted for smuggling heroin, but has long claimed she was a victim of human trafficking. Those who trafficked her have also been prosecuted in the Philippines. No date has been set for Veloso’s return, although Indonesian officials said she must still serve her sentence when back home. Officials in Manila said Veloso could be back in the Philippines before Christmas. Some Australian newspapers reported that the remaining 'Bali Nine' members could also 'be home in time for Christmas.' Seven 'Bali Nine' members were sentenced to life without parole. One died of cancer in June 2018, while another had her sentence commuted in November of that year. The remaining five – Matthew Norman, Michael Czugaj, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens and Si Yi Chen – are in Indonesian prisons. Australia’s national broadcaster, ABC reported that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had lobbied Indonesia’s Prabowo for them to serve the rest of their sentences in Australian prison when the two leaders met at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru. Indonesia’s law minister said the repatriation efforts were 'important to maintain our good relations' with other countries. '[But] foreign national prisoners being transferred to their home countries does not mean they are free,' Supratman, the minister, said on Sunday according to a transcript of his remarks. [T]hey must complete their prison terms in their respective countries according to Indonesian legal decisions.' Dinna Prapto Raharja, an international relations scholar, believes Prabowo made a poor decision in agreeing to return the 'Bali Nine' members. Veloso was a victim who deserved an earlier release, but the Bali Nine were convicted of severe drug offenses and should face their punishment, said Dinna, of Synergy Policies, a Jakarta-based think-tank. 'It’s not a good precedent for us. This is not the president’s domain,' she told BenarNews. 'The president can grant clemency, but sending the Bali Nine back to Australia without going through proper legal procedures is wrong.' Some in Australia agreed with Dinna, as reactions on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) showed. X user @tom_mende wrote: 'There is no humanitarian case. They wanted to spread their poison for personal profit devoid of any morality or humanity. No second chances.' 'The Bali nine are criminals: do the crime, do the time,' wrote another X user, @TafPomScotiPole. Usman Hamid, executive director of human rights group Amnesty International Indonesia, hopes Prabowo’s proposal is not merely opportunistic and instead involves a genuine reform of the country’s harsh drug policies. 'This should be the start of a consistent human rights-based approach to drug cases, regardless of whether they involve foreigners or citizens,' he told BenarNews. '[But] the question remains whether this …is merely an ad hoc decision influenced by political interests and diplomatic pressures.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-rVeiPtDcMc_	2024-11-26T16:02:14-08:00	
Saudi Arabia Approves FY2025 Budget, Forecasts $27bn Deficit Amid...	By Dayan Abou Tine Saudi Arabia on Tuesday approved the state budget for fiscal year 2025 with revenues projected at SR1.18 trillion ($315.73 billion) and expenditure at SR1.28 trillion, leading to a deficit of SR101 billion. The Finance Ministry forecasted Saudi Arabia’s Real GDP growth at 4.6 percent in 2025, up from the 0.8 percent estimate for 2024. This growth will be driven by a rise in non-oil sector activities, according to the statement. The figures align with projections from the ministry’s pre-budget statement in September, showing a 4 percent decline in revenues, a 4 percent decline in expenditures, and a 12 percent lower deficit compared to the latest FY 2024 estimates. The FY2025 forecast are based on a baseline scenario, which represents a middle ground between higher and lower revenue projections, taking into account potential changes in economic activity and global petroleum market conditions. The ministry projects the deficit to remain at similar levels in the medium term, with SR130 billion in 2026 and SR140 billion in 2027, driven by the government’s strategic expansionary spending policies aimed at fostering economic diversification and sustainable growth. Revenues are expected to rise over the next two years, reaching around SR1.3 trillion by 2027. The Kingdom’s total debt is projected to reach SR1.3 trillion in 2025, equivalent to 29.9 percent of GDP, reflecting a sustainable level to meet financing needs. Revised projections for Saudi Arabia’s 2024 budget indicate a deficit of SR115 billion, with total debt expected to reach SR1.2 trillion, or 29.3 percent of GDP. The fiscal year 2025 budget prioritizes maintaining essential services for citizens and residents, while accelerating spending on key projects and sectors. It focuses on preserving fiscal stability and achieving long-term sustainability by managing government reserves and maintaining sustainable public debt levels, ensuring the Kingdom’s resilience against unforeseen economic shocks. In a statement following the weekly Cabinet session, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman emphasized the government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the Kingdom’s economic base. 'We will continue to work on expanding the economic base and enhancing the Kingdom’s financial position,' he stated. He also highlighted the pivotal role of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth funds—the Public Investment Fund and the National Development Fund—in driving economic stability and achieving Vision 2030 objectives. 'These funds are essential to diversifying the economy and supporting long-term investments,' he said. Saudi Arabia’s economy is advancing through strategic reforms and robust investment initiatives under Vision 2030, emphasizing diversification and fiscal sustainability. Key objectives include increasing the private sector’s contribution to GDP, growing the share of foreign investment, and boosting non-oil exports. The strategy also prioritizes reducing unemployment and accelerating investment growth by enhancing the business environment, providing innovative financing solutions, and attracting regional headquarters of multinational companies to establish a strong presence in the Kingdom. Key enablers, including the PIF, are driving private sector growth, launching transformative projects, and fostering new industries. These efforts, outlined in the 2025 budget statement, aim to boost social and economic outcomes while ensuring resilience against global challenges and long-term prosperity. Breakdown of projected government revenues and expenditures The ministry projects tax income at SR379 billion in 2025, making up around 32 percent of total revenues. This represents a 4 percent increase compared to the 2024 estimates. The majority of these levies, accounting for 77 percent, come from taxes on goods and services. According to the ministry, this growth is driven by sustained improvements in economic activity, the ongoing development of tax administration, and enhanced collection processes, all of which have contributed to a boost in total tax revenues. In terms of sector-specific expenditures, the military sector received the largest allocation at SR272 billion, marking a 5 percent increase compared to the 2024 estimates. The health and social development sector followed with a 20.25 percent share amounting to SR260 billion. General items with 14.95 percent share of 2025 budgeted expenditures will be allocated SR192 billion. Financing the deficit The Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the National Debt Management Center develops an annual borrowing plan aligned with the Kingdom’s medium-term debt strategy, ensuring long-term debt sustainability. This strategy not only diversifies financing sources, encompassing both domestic and external markets, but also enhances the Kingdom’s standing in global debt markets. Additionally, the government is expanding its financing channels by tapping into bond and sukuk issuance, loans, and alternative funding models like project and infrastructure financing, as well as collaborating with export credit agencies. According to the Ministry of Finance, the Kingdom maintains a robust fiscal position, underpinned by substantial financial reserves and manageable public debt levels. This fiscal strength provides the government with the ability to manage potential economic shocks and meet its financing needs across short, medium, and long-term horizons, while securing favorable borrowing terms from both domestic and international markets. The crown prince also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to fiscal reforms that have already improved Saudi Arabia’s credit ratings. While the projected deficit for 2025 signals short-term fiscal challenges, the government is focused on ensuring long-term economic sustainability. He noted that this year’s budget will continue to prioritize economic diversification, with significant emphasis on empowering the private sector and fostering growth in small and medium-sized enterprises. The crown prince stressed that, despite global economic uncertainties, Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to navigate external challenges and play an increasingly central role in regional and global economic stability. 'Our economy is well-prepared to overcome challenges,' he said. He also emphasized the importance of long-term financial planning to maintain momentum on Vision 2030 initiatives, underscoring the government's focus on spending efficiency and transparent execution of the budget to meet its strategic goals. Moody’s upgraded Saudi Arabia’s credit rating to 'Aa3' from 'A1' on Friday, highlighting the country’s progress in diversifying its economy beyond oil. The Kingdom is investing heavily in Vision 2030 initiatives, focusing on sectors like tourism, sports, and manufacturing, while also attracting foreign investment. Despite lower oil prices and reduced production, Saudi Arabia continues to adjust its spending, delaying or scaling back some Vision 2030 projects while prioritizing others. Moody’s revised the country’s outlook to stable, reflecting uncertainties in global economic conditions and the oil market. In September, S&P also upgraded Saudi Arabia’s outlook to positive due to strong non-oil growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-qFCFsuWCKvr	2024-11-26T15:59:18-08:00	
Pentagon Consults With Interagency Partners On Israel-Lebanon Cea...	By Jim Garmone Israel and Lebanon have agreed to a ceasefire which could lead to a cessation of Hezbollah attacks on Israel and the phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, according to news reports. The U.S. Defense Department will play a role in the ceasefire, but there are few details, said Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder Tuesday. 'We're, of course, strongly supportive of a ceasefire,' Ryder said during a Pentagon news conference. 'We're consulting closely with our interagency partners in terms of what potential contributions the DOD can make.' DOD has worked tirelessly with interagency partners and international allies and friends to end the conflict in the region. 'The Department of Defense plays an important role within our interagency here in the U.S. and on working with partners in the region to prevent a wider conflict,' he said. The conflict between Israel and the Iranian proxy Hezbollah has killed approximately 3,800 people and wounded about 16,000, Lebanese officials have said. 'We've seen diplomatic means as key to enabling both Lebanese and Israeli citizens to return to their homes on both sides of the blue line,' Ryder said. 'That's probably the most significant [development], as well as just the simple fact of reducing the amount of violence that we're seeing and the destruction and death on both sides of the border.' Ryder said the United States would like to see a ceasefire in Gaza as well. 'Certainly, we still want to see a situation in Gaza where there is a ceasefire, so that we can increase the flow of humanitarian assistance and restore a sense of stability and security in that region,' he said. The ceasefire with Lebanon could carry over to Gaza. There is 'a lot of potential good could come out of this ceasefire [with Lebanon],' Ryder said. Ryder was asked about reports of drones flying over bases in the United Kingdom that the United States uses. The general said none of the incursions has impacted base residents or the missions of the units on those bases. 'We're, of course, continuing to work with host nation authorities and our mission partners to ensure the safety of our personnel, our facilities and equipment,' he said. 'You know, the bottom line is, it's something that we're going to take seriously. We're continuing to look into it, but as of right now, it has not had any significant mission impact.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-vIGg4NdYvKo	2024-11-26T15:55:43-08:00	
Iran Says It Will Arm New Warship With Long-Range Missiles	The commander of the Iranian Navy unveiled plans to put into service a new homegrown military vessel that will be equipped with long-range vertically-launched air defense missiles. Rear Admiral Shahram Irani conducted an interview with Tasnim on the occasion of National Navy Day. Highlighting the Navy’s progress in manufacturing a broad range of equipment, the commander said a new homegrown vessel, called 'Kurdistan', will be unveiled in the near future. He noted that the new warship will be furnished with 'Sayyad' air defense missile system which can vertically fire long-range missiles. The commander also said another new vessel, named 'Zagros', will come into operation, adding that the Sabalan destroyer’s missile capabilities have been quadrupled. The Navy has also developed coast-to-sea missiles with ranges in excess of 1,000 kilometers using innovative technologies, he stated. Praising the Iranian Navy’s progress in the submarine industry, Rear Admiral Irani said manufacturing heavy and super-heavy submarines has been on the agenda. He said the Navy is developing a heavy submarine, dubbed 'Be’sat', which will be furnished with up-to-date arms and become operational after the necessary tests. Asked about the Navy’s drone power, the commander said his forces will receive two types of 'strategic drones' manufactured by domestic experts. While the Iranian Navy has focused its attention on the UAVs for patrol and reconnaissance, considering the nature of its operations, such as ensuring maritime security, supporting ships, and combatting the sources of threat in combat, it will also begin to develop logistical naval drones that can carry heavy payloads, assist the vessels in an emergency, ship medical equipment and even persons, and transfer medication and blood shipments at a long distance away, the commander added. In a meeting with Navy commanders in November 2023, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei lauded the Iranian Navy’s 'eye-catching and incredible advances' after the victory of the Islamic Revolution. 'In the early years of the Revolution, the presence of the Navy beyond the territorial waters was unimaginable, but now the Navy circumnavigates the globe mightily and formidably and returns home proudly,' the Leader said. In that meeting, Rear Admiral Irani said the Navy’s two principal policies are 'expansion of sphere of influence in the sea' and 'reliance on technology and science' with the purpose of strengthening the Establishment’s power.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdTAWidC3F-imLmjAsogzc	2024-11-26T15:52:45-08:00	
Today’s Perspective – OpEd	By Dr J Scott Younger The last few weeks have been some of the most unusual that have taken place. Two wars continuing with no end in sight, not to mention internal disputes in Sudan and Myanmar which seldom draw press attention, swamped by almost constant news over the US presidential election. The presidential election was the strangest that the US had ever held, a person charged with many misdemeanours, Donald Trump, albeit a former president himself, representing the Republican Party against Kamala Harris, the current Vice-president of the opposing Democratic Party. All the way through, the polls said the result was too close to call. The result, however, astonished most people, and concerned many others across the world. Trump won by a big margin, and the Republicans for the upcoming 4 years have a total grip on the legislature. He will have authority to push ahead with his programme with little domestic opposition to stand in his way. Why are people across the world so worried? In the latter days of Trump’s campaigning, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man by all accounts, appeared at his side on the stage, prancing around like an over grown schoolboy with too many toys that he did not know what to do with. Presumably, he has a suitable arrangement that will help Trump with outstanding personal issues in return for a job in Trump’s cabinet management team. Musk has to make the civil service slimmer and more efficient to carry out the Trump programme; in charge of ‘draining the swamp’ that is Washington! He has years of experience to bring to the job!! As the cabinet team is chosen, one person who must cause some concern in Middle East quarters is the ambassador designate to Israel. He does not believe in a two-state solution. nor does he believe in a country called Palestine. This must be music to Netanyahu’s ears; he can go ahead with all his plans, squeezing out their neighbours, the indigenous people. The Israelis have been clearing the northern part of Gaza of Palestinian people and intend to take over the land with the aggressive settlers, who came down recently to have a look at their ‘new property’. Neither UN staff nor foreign media have been allowed into Gaza, and they have been given 3 months to get out completely. The Israelis say that they are meeting their obligation for humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, but all parties say it is simply not so – less than 20% of requirement. The citizens of Gaza have to put up with a daily bombing and continued loss of life, just in case they want to stay! The Israelis say they are bombing Hamas targets, although all the damage caused is usually a school building providing shelter for homeless people, mostly women and children, a further few killed. President Biden has two months left in office to do something about Gaza and the Palestinians, but nothing will be done. He will continue with his weak, hopeless foreign n policy that has marked his time in office ever since the undignified scramble out of Afghanistan leaving the Afghanis in the hands of the Taliban. The squeezing out of the Palestinian people on the West Bank continues unabated. The far-right settlers come down from the north, armed, with the Israeli military standing by. The settlers give the locals, who generally have owned and farmed the land for generations back to the days of the Ottoman empire, are given a week to leave, resistance being threatened at gun point and worse, imprisonment and sometimes shooting. The UN marks it down as another point to take up as a criminal act by the Israeli Government, some day in the future, to take to the Court of Human Rights, and the west stands by for leadership and action by the US. However, with the new US ambassador coming in next year the situation can only become worse for the Palestinians because the Trump presidency would appear to back the Israeli position. The Palestinians side say they will resist but how? Trump stated that he would bring peace to the Middle East, which is good. But how does he get the Israelis to understand what is needed and not their current stated goal to dominate the whole territory, which was once known as Palestine. Now it is a far cry from what they agreed to in 1948 when they were given the right to assume ownership of a fair slice of the land. The President-elect has a good rapport with the Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, and would seem to encourage him by appointing a pro-Israel ambassador designate. Hamas and Hezbollah are designated terrorist organisations by the US and west, but we forget that Israel aggression in the past brought them about. We can only hope that Trump sees things as they are and can bring about a just and fair peace. Most Israelis want the same. An escalation of hostilities, albeit they are mostly one-sided, will risk bringing in other players and expansion of the war. Trump has an opportunity to show the just side of the US in world affairs. Perhaps a compromise? The other war that will require Trump’s early attention is the rather longer war, 3 years that the Russians, thanks to Vladimir Putin, have put on Ukraine. It is hard to believe that in the early years of this century, Russia and the west were approaching a reasonable level of if not total détente. Something happened in 2004, Putin, who had control of the Kremlin by that time, changed and the west were to be viewed as the competitors, sometimes aggressively. Everything became answerable to him, even the oligarchs. Perhaps he felt that Russia was not getting the respect it was due and he felt it was his duty to restore the pride in nation that it had in Peter the Great’s Day. That meant some ‘empire’ of lands lost when the Iron Curtain collapsed had to be regained, e.g. Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, and so on. It was not unhelpful that a percentage of oligarchs’ earnings came back to the Kremlin/Putin. Putin, by all accounts is a very wealthy man, and many people have died because of his ambitions. The lesson of history! However, Putin is a ‘good’ friend of Trump’s from all accounts, telephoning him with congratulations of his election success. If this is properly used then Trump could use this to end the war, although a fair amount of comprise will be needed, which will not greatly please Volodymr Zelenskyy. In stopping the outflow of US$, as Trump has indicated, both NATO and Ukraine will suffer. Perhaps a compromise, however unsatisfactory in some quarters, will be agreed involving a monitored border as indicated previously. The war will hence cease. Some of Trump’s early appointments have been described as shocking, laughable, and unbelievable, even by many Republicans. These are defence secretary, Pete Hesgeth, health secretary, R F Kennedy, and attorney general, Matt Gaetz. They, like Musk, have little or no experience of the job they are supposed to be doing. It is very apparent that personal loyalty to Trump himself is more important than job experience. The defence secretary designate perhaps feels ‘threatened’, because the heads of the armed forces at the Pentagon have higher rank than he achieved when he was in military service, although a decorated war veteran, and he is seeking their replacement. Interesting times The next seven weeks will see a transition with world leaders adjusting to the quite different tone of the US presidency. In addition, a sign of the times, the recently completed meeting on climate change, COP29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, was like a ‘damp squib’. It was a failure, most of the key countries for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) were not present, the US, China, and the leader of the host country boasted about Azerbaijan’s development of fossil fuels. I predict that if there are any more Climate Change meetings they will be totally different in concept. We shall have a US administration under Trump for four years going full bent on drilling for fossil fuels; they don’t believe in Climate Change. They have centuries of fossil fuels readily available and they are going to use them to benefit the economy – America First. China, while it uses 50% of the world’s coal produced are investing extensively in solar panels and have started to invest in clean nuclear, and gradually will make a transition to renewables. They have embraced the electric car market, while the American market for electric cars has stalled. Interesting times, if concerning.

Sustainable Transport Key To Achieving Asia-Pacific Region’s Deve...	Across the Asia-Pacific region, especially in urban centres, electric cars and buses are increasingly replacing gasoline-powered ones as a means of transportation. Aided by the ubiquity of smart devices, smart mobility and other transport innovations are significantly reshaping everyday life through ride-sharing apps, driver assistance technology and real-time traffic management. With new highways and railways operationalized in the last decade, the region is getting yet more connected, while the ongoing digitalization of road, rail and maritime freight transport further improves efficiency and cost reduction. These are part of the wider trend of sustainable transport development, which benefits everyone through making the transport of people and goods safer, 'greener,' more efficient and more accessible. Countries across Asia and the Pacific have made great progress towards these goals, but major challenges remain. More cooperation will be needed to advance these trends and overcome obstacles. The transition to sustainable transport leads to interlinked benefits that are felt across multiple aspects of life. The move towards public transport, walking and cycling not only improves general mobility by relieving congestion stress, but also significantly cuts down on emissions from personal vehicles, reduces the risk of road accidents and promotes physical fitness. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps offer personalized transport solutions tailored to individual needs, reducing fuel consumption and waste, while connected and autonomous vehicle technology improves traffic flow and prevents crashes – by UN estimates, up to 80 percent of non-alcohol ones – by minimizing human error. Coupled with inclusive transport planning, these developments make it much easier for the elderly, disabled, pregnant women and other underserved populations to access transport solutions and fully engage in society. The knock-on effects across economic growth, health, climate action and social inclusion thus make sustainable transport a key enabler of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. The good news is that the Asia-Pacific region has made solid progress towards sustainable transport. Coordinated regional development of transport infrastructure continues to advance economies of scale to meet increased demand in freight transport. Currently, approximatively 145,000 km of Asian Highways, 121,000 km of Trans-Asian Railways and 275 dry ports cover all parts of the region and almost 99.7 per cent of the total population, while the region also hosts the world's ten largest container ports and accounts for more than half of the global maritime trade. In addition to the widespread adoption of smart mobility solutions, countries are in general committed to the decarbonization of their roads, railways and maritime transport, with plans to electrify transport modes and promotion of fuel efficiency and the use of clean sources of fuel. Most countries saw a decline in road traffic deaths in the last decade, and several have made progress in improving gender equality in the transport sector. However, this path is fraught with challenges. Most of the projected future growth in global transport demand will take place in the Asia-Pacific region, owing partly to rapid urbanization and a growing appetite for personal vehicles. While the most tangible effect of this growth will be the rise in greenhouse gas emissions due to the ongoing heavy reliance on fossil fuels, these trends also add additional strain to existing urban transport systems, many of which are underinvested. Missing links and sub-standard quality of infrastructure, coupled with lack of transport facilitation, continue to increase costs and delays of international transport, especially in landlocked developing countries. Likewise, small island developing States continue to show limited and often stagnant levels of their maritime connectivity, hindering their integration into the regional and global economy. The disparity in technological capabilities between countries, as well as current gaps in meeting low-carbon transport goals, hinder the effective adoption of region-wide smart mobility systems and net-zero strategies, respectively. And despite improvements, a person in Asia and the Pacific loses their life in a road accident every 45 seconds. Women only make up approximately 16 per cent of the regional transport workforce, a slightly lower figure than the global average. Government representatives gathered in early November and assessed these achievements and challenges within the framework of the Regional Action Programme for Sustainable Transport Development in Asia and the Pacific. Many tasks, such as transport decarbonization, cannot be overcome by any country alone; meanwhile, the benefits of transport innovations such as digitalization and automation will only be fully realized if widely implemented. With Asia and the Pacific 32 years behind in achieving the SDGs, accelerating sustainable transport development benefits everyone so everyone needs to get on board to make it happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilCEdbDNTlv_q	2024-11-26T09:35:40-08:00	
NATO-Ukraine Council Meets Following Russia’s Launch Of Intermedi...	Ambassadors met in the NATO-Ukraine Council (NUC) today (26 November 2024) to discuss the security situation in Ukraine following Russia’s launch of an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) last week. Senior Ukrainian military officials briefed the Council via video link. During the meeting, NATO Allies reaffirmed their support for Ukraine. The attack, which targeted Dnipro, is seen as another attempt by Russia to terrorise the civilian population in Ukraine and intimidate those who support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s illegal and unprovoked aggression. As earlier noted by the NATO Spokesperson, Farah Dakhlallah, 'deploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO Allies from supporting Ukraine.' The NATO-Ukraine Council provides a forum for consultation between Allies and Ukraine on security issues of common concern, including Russia’s war of aggression. The meeting was chaired by NATO’s acting Deputy Secretary General, Boris Ruge. The next meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council is due to take place during the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers that will be held on 3-4 December.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilJhtEeCvgevt	2024-11-26T09:34:24-08:00	
Ateneo Develops AI To Forecast Market Interest Rates	Mathematicians from the Ateneo de Manila University have developed artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning tools that can help predict money market interest rates, invaluable for decision-makers in business and government. In simple terms, the market interest rate is the cost of borrowing money or the reward for saving it. This changes based on supply and demand: if many people are borrowing but few are saving, rates go up; if the opposite happens, rates go down. Interest rates are also affected by inflation (since higher prices mean higher rates) as well as by countries’ central banks (which adjust rates to help the economy grow or to control rising prices). Essentially, interest rates help determine how money moves in the economy. 'Interest rates are among the most important macroeconomic factors considered by both government and private entities when making investment and policy decisions. A reliable forecast is a requisite to sound management of exposure to different types of risk,' the researchers explained. The Ateneo researchers tested two deep learning models: Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Vanilla Generative Adversarial Networks (VGAN). Both successfully anticipated changes in Philippine Benchmark Valuation (BVAL) rates before and during the pandemic, showcasing the models’ robust capability to potentially foresee economic fluctuations and market disruptions. MLP is a type of artificial neural network that passes the data through a series of cells, each of which processes the information in its own way and adds to the network’s overall understanding of the data. This method is often used for image recognition and machine translation because of its ability to find complex patterns in data. Meanwhile, VGAN actually consists of two networks: a generator that creates synthetic data, and a discriminator that evaluates the data’s authenticity. By working in opposition to each other—hence, 'adversarial'—the networks are able to refine and improve their analyses. Conceptual diagrams of artificial intelligence learning models, MLP (top) and VGAN (bottom). SOURCE: Bata et al. The researchers found that both models produced reliable forecasts of one-, three-, six-month, and one-year BVAL rates within the limits of the datasets used. They successfully predicted key trends by incorporating as many as 16 domestic and global economic indicators, including inflation, exchange rates, and credit default swaps. MLP showed strong performance with fewer variables and simpler structures, making it an efficient choice for straightforward analyses. Meanwhile, VGAN excelled more in analyzing complex scenarios, achieving high accuracy when working with larger datasets. The practical implications of these AI deep learning models are substantial, according to the researchers: financial institutions could potentially deploy them to manage market, credit, liquidity, and other risks; and governments could also potentially use these models to optimize debt issuance strategies by reducing borrowing costs. The study highlights the growing role of AI in financial decision-making and suggests exploring more advanced neural network designs to further enhance forecasting accuracy. It is hoped that businesses and policymakers will come to embrace these technologies in order to gain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving data-driven landscape. Halle Megan L. Bata, Mark Jayson A. Victoria, Wyonna Chezska B. Alvarez, Elvira P. de Lara-Tuprio, and Armin Paul D. Allado published their paper, 'Deep Learning Approaches in Interest Rate Forecasting,' last November 15 in the journal, AIP Conference Proceedings.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilJBoB-mSaVzK	2024-11-26T09:33:21-08:00	
RoboCop29 – OpEd	The recent (nomadically arranged Climate event called Review Mechanism – Conference of the Parties to the UN FCCC, or shortly) COP – this time the 29th, hosted by Azerbaijan – showed once again how the natural process of climate change is being misused as an instrument of political and techno-economic dominance and deeper psychologisation of developed countries over developing world. Nature does not change. Change, as a cosmic constant, is a nature itself. Still, even Heraclitus understood, that this force is never eruptive or destructive (explosive, combusting and polarising), but eternally gradual and constructive; holistic, inclusive and implosive. Look up the evening skies and this backbone of night above us: That will be the exact way how entire clockwork of universe functions. Hence, Climate change is an intrinsic, cyclical process that takes place over millions of years. Our planet went through significant climatic variations long before the emergence of modern civilization - from ice ages to warm periods. All credible scientific data shows that the Earth's temperature has changed dramatically throughout its geological history, even without any human influence. Although Homo Sapiens undoubtedly has its impact on the troposphere, it is fundamental to understand that human activities are still sequesterable part of the Earth’s eco-system. Nature has exceptional self-regulatory mechanisms that maintain equilibrium despite various changes and periodic disruptions. For example, varying CO2 levels throughout the geomorphologic history of planet, and its relation to the growth size properties and quantities of Earth’s biota, etc. Despite these well-established facts, the developed countries, which have built their wealth and posture on carbonics over the past 200 years, are now trying to impose expensive and often untested ‘green technologies’ all over the world, using the climate change as an excuse. Ultimately, these ‘novel technologies’ would require a new financial and technology-transfer exposure and dependency for the poor of South vis-à-vis North. De-psychologisation of issues, de-monopolisation of technologies Thus, the promised 300 billion dollars a year for the developing (and LDC – the Least Developed) world – as ‘won’ in Baku – is not a solution, but yet a new form of economic dependence. (Although the group of Vulnerable-77 – including Small Island Nations – vocally demanded 500 billion per annum.) A new market of beforehand patented technologies under the control of handful multinational corporations is being created, while ignoring the fact that nature itself is the best at regulating climate processes. Nature conservation – to say understanding the intrinsic self-regulatory designs, is a key. But, this calls for the multilateral and all-stake-holders approach founded on real scientific facts, not on politically motivated or profit-driven myopic agendas. Global South have a right to economic progress (so-called Right to Development, and Right to Link Trade to Development as fundamental achievement of the UN through UNCTAD final acts decades ago). The imposition of expensive technological solutions and limiting access to cheaper energy sources and solutions directly hampers developing world. It is particularly worrying that the natural processes of climate change are being used as an excuse to create new financial, technological, even psycho-social control mechanisms. Sustainable environmental protection necessities reasonable management of natural resources and respect for fundamental laws of nature (intrinsic processes), not expensive, psychologised and monopolised technological intervention that disrupts the self-regulatory mechanisms of nature. /The very same, simple efficient accessible and affordable, principle should be applied to our medicine: Real health protection assumes reasonable consumption of organic food and respect for natural intra-body processes, and not expensive and harmful chemical (or similar artificial) interventions that can disrupt the intrinsic self-regulatory mechanisms of our body./ It is time to rethink the current approach to climate change (alarmism for exclusivity and monopolisation purpose), and architect a model that will truly serve nature conservation, not the interests of large corporations and (few related circles of influence, concentrated within the several) developed countries. We need a system that will respect intrinsic and indigenous designs, and enable sustainable development for everyone, without creating new forms of politico-economic subordination. After all, holistic and all-inclusive is a mechanism that nature itself uses when creates, preserves and enhances. Eruption, polarisation, exclusion collisions are rare occurrences when our nature is about to destruct and eliminate. Consequently, instead of fighting natural climate cycles, we should rather focus on protecting our environment from provoked encouraged and extended armed conflicts, from unjust distributions of eruptive asymmetries, from over-exploitation and over-production and to it related pollutions of all sorts velocities and spectres, while respecting the right of all peoples and generations to learn, develop and prosper. The 3M principle, as easily quantifiable SD matrix is beautiful in its simplicity: maximum good, for maximum spices (not to forget: continents, nations generations and classes too) over maxium period of time. The new Bandung of 1955 is needed today. This spirit that engaged South for the first time in history, and soon after gave a birth to the NAM (Non-Aliened Movement) could be the right answer at the right time. (Neither of the present formats fits: G-7, G-20, BRICS.) Strong and powerful block of Climate ‘alarmists’ must be faced with the New Bandung, NAM, or to say Climate ‘realists’, block of a raising yet not coherent South. Climate Change and sustainability are planetary issues that require our universal response. Instable and unjust international order, as such, is more of a problem generator than of a solution provider. Our developed world can hold its might – but Global South has its Right.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilCVDYOUiYon8	2024-11-26T09:32:18-08:00	
Robert Reich: The One Big Constraint On Trump – OpEd	Will anything stop Trump? He will have control over both chambers of Congress, a tractable Supreme Court, a political base of fiercely loyal MAGAs, a media ecosystem that amplifies his lies (now including Musk’s horrific X as well as Rupert Murdoch’s reliably mendacious Fox News), and a thin majority of voters in the 2024 election. He doesn’t worry about another election because he won’t be eligible to run again (or he’ll ignore the Constitution and stay on). Of course, there are the midterm elections of 2026. But even if Democrats take back both chambers, Trump and his incipient administration are aiming to wreak so much havoc on America in the meantime that Democrats can’t remedy it. The Republican-controlled Senate starting January 3 won’t restrain Trump. Yes, Trump overreached with his pick of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Apparently even Senate Republicans can’t abide sex trafficking girls for drug-infested orgies, but this is a very low bar. So, as a practical matter, is anything stopping Trump? Yes, and here’s a hint of what it is: On Friday, Trump picked Scott Bessent to serve as treasury secretary. Bessent is the man Elon Musk derided only a week ago as the 'business-as-usual choice' for treasury secretary, in contrast to Howard Lutnick, who Musk said would 'actually enact change.' Musk’s view of 'change' is to blow a place up, which was what Musk did when he bought Twitter. Over the last two weeks, Musk has convinced Trump to appoint bomb-throwers Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Health and Human Services and Pete Hegseth to Defense, and to put Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget. But Bessent is the opposite of a bomb-thrower. He’s a billionaire hedge fund manager, founder of the investment firm Key Square Capital Management, and a protege of the MAGA arch-villain George Soros (he’s also gay, which the MAGA base may not like, either). Why did Trump appoint the 'business as usual' Bessent to be treasury secretary? Because the treasury secretary is the most important economic job in the U.S. government. Trump has never understood much about economics, but he knows two things: High interest rates can throttle an economy (and bring down a president’s party), and high stock prices are good (at least for Trump and his investor class). Trump doesn’t want to do anything that will cause bond traders to raise long-term interest rates out of fear of future inflation, and he wants stock traders to be so optimistic about corporate profits they raise share prices. So he has appointed a treasury secretary who will reassure the bond and stock markets. Stock and bond markets constitute the only real constraint on Trump — the only things whose power he’s afraid of. But wait. What about Trump’s plan to raise tariffs? He’s floated a blanket tariff of 10 to 20 percent on nearly all imports, 25 percent on imports from Mexico, and 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. Tariffs of this size would increase consumer prices and fuel inflation — driving interest rates upward. (The cost of tariffs are borne by American businesses and households, rather than foreign companies.) Tariffs could also invite retaliation from foreign governments and thereby dry up export markets for American-based corporations — in which case the stock market would tank. (The last time America raised tariffs on all imports — Herbert Hoover’s and Congressmen Smoot and Hawley’s Tariff Act of 1930 — the Great Depression worsened.) In short, tariffs will rattle stock and bond markets, doing the exact opposite of what Trump wants. So Trump has appointed a treasury secretary who will soothe Wall Street’s nerves — not just because Bessent is a Wall Street billionaire who speaks the Street’s language but also because the Street doesn’t really believe Bessent wants higher tariffs. Bessent has described Trump’s plan for blanket tariffs as a 'maximalist' negotiating strategy — suggesting Trump’s whole tariff proposal is a strategic bluff. The Street apparently thinks tariffs won’t rise much when other countries respond to the bluff with what Trump sees as concessions. Instead, the Street expects Bessent to be spending his energies seeking lower taxes, especially for big corporations and wealthy Americans, and helping Musk and Ramaswamy cut spending and roll back regulations. It’s a sad commentary on the state of American democracy when the main constraint on the madman soon to occupy the Oval Office is Wall Street. I suppose we should be grateful there’s any constraint at all.

Donald Trump Provides Ray Of Hope For Ending Regional Conflicts –...	During Donald Trump's recent successful Presidential election campaign , there are two points which he repeatedly stressed namely ' America first policy ' and his desire to stop the war between the countries . Obviously, his America First policy mean that he would stop the flow of illegal migrants into USA, though one cannot be sure as to whether he would be able expel the illegal migrants already present in USA. Further, Trump is likely to impose tariff on import and export of goods to protect and ensure the growth of American economy. Of course, imposition of tariffs is a double edged weapon and there is limit beyond which this cannot be done,. All said and done, no one can find fault with Trump for his America First policy, which is and which should be the country's policy of leader of every country. What concern the world more than his America First policy is that his repeated assertion that Ukraine Russia war should stop immediately . With regard to Hamas Israel war , he may not have said so in such clear term. However, he has expressed view about the need for peaceful Middle East region. This approach of Donald Trump is in refreshing contrast to the postures and policies implemented / action initiated by several earlier Presidents of USA. The world community certainly views such policy pronouncement of Donald Trump with level of seriousness, expecting that he would implement his plans, and would bite the bullet if it becomes necessary to achieve his objectives. Donald Trump's concern for world peace and to stop war in the world appears to be genuine and there is no need to doubt his intention. During his earlier term as U S President, after a few rhetorics against North Korea, Trump travelled all the way to Singapore to meet the President of North Korea to build bridge of peace with that country. This is a remarkable peace initiative, though this was not followed by his successor , resulting in the relation between North Korea and USA back to square one. As on today, there is still no clarity as to how Trump would stop the Russian Ukraine war and Israel Hamas conflict. However, some initial signs are encouraging after successful election of Trump as U S President. The President of Russia and President of Ukraine have started talking about peace possibilities discreetly , as both the countries are conscious of the fact that this war is causing enormous damage to the economy of both the countries. Now, Trump has made a statement that President of Ukraine should meet Russian President to create right climate for ending the war . Possibly, America's suspension of arms support to Ukraine would make Ukraine agree for the peace initiative and Russian President would also be in favour of peace, if American support for Ukraine would end or taper. One can be sure that Russia will not let go this opportunity to get out of this Ukraine conflict, after it has badly burnt its fingers with its initial expectation of short war with Ukraine not materialising. There is also a ray of hope of the conflict between Hamas and Israel ending, with Israel official announcing that Israel cabinet meeting would decide on approving Lebanon cease fire deal with Israel. It is said that this proposal would entail Israel military withdrawal within 60 days. It is true that only two hands can clap and the desire and compulsive need to end the conflict has to be there in the countries involved. There is a visible trend now being seen that the two hands will clap. This is certainly due to what can be called as Trump effect and the world would be grateful to Trump, if he could ensure the cessation of the ongoing wars. Rightly or wrongly , there is a broad world view that the policy and priority of USA government to interfere in the affairs of other nations is one of the chief reasons for several conflicts that have taken place in the past. Many people think that past US governments have been imagining that God has created USA to police the world. Possibly, Trump's approach to world peace would ensure that this negative image of USA amongst world community would be erased to some extent. Today, there is also a developing view across the world that China has definite greed for territorial expansion and for economically and industrially dominating the world. Trump's efforts for world peace and its success would also considerably depend on his ability to tame China and show its place. China need to end its military conflict with India , Philippines and its military posturing against Taiwan and give up its efforts to dominate weak countries by driving them into debt burden. Some discerning observers are of the view that the recent efforts of China to have sort of peace with India when Chinese President met Indian Prime Minister, could be due to Trump effect. Anyway, there is no doubt that Trump provides a ray of hope for ending regional conflicts and there is expectation that he would ensure protection for America's interests at no cost to other nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilFJB1Dgb_-Yx	2024-11-26T09:28:03-08:00	
Arrest Warrants From The Hague: The ICC, Netanyahu And Gallant – ...	The slow, often grinding machinery of international law has just received a push along with the issuing of three arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court. They are for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and, rather incongruously, Hamas figure Mohammed Deif. The last issue is somewhat odd given claims by Israel that he was killed in an airstrike in July, though Hamas has never confirmed nor denied the fate of the man also known as Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri. The issue of the warrants was the culmination of a request on May 20 by the ICC prosecutor to a Pre-Trial Chamber of the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and three senior Hamas officials. Two have been withdrawn, given the confirmed killings of both Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh. On November 21, the three-judge panel of Pre-Trial Chamber I unanimously rejected Israel’s assertion that the ICC lacked jurisdiction over the Situation in the State of Palestine in general and over Israeli nationals more specifically, 'as the Court can exercise its jurisdiction on the basis of the territorial jurisdiction of Palestine.' The Chamber also rejected Israel’s request that the Prosecution provide a new notification of an initiation of investigation into its authorities under the ICC Statute, given that the parameters of the investigation had not essentially changed. Nor had Israel pursued a request for deferral of the investigation when given the chance in 2021. The arrest warrants, issued in accordance with the law of international armed conflict, remain the most telling aspect of the determinations. Despite being classified as 'secret', the Chamber deemed it important to release some degree of detail on what they entail. Accordingly, it found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant bore criminal responsibility as 'co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts'. There were also reasonable grounds to believe that both figures bore 'criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population.' The ghoulish picture of alleged conduct is sketched with chilling detail. The alleged crimes against humanity against the civilian population in Gaza were deemed to be widespread and systematic. It was reasonable to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant had, with intent and knowledge, deprived the population of Gaza of such necessities to survival as food, water, medicine, medical supplies, fuel and electricity 'from at least' October 8, 2023 to May 20, 2024. This finding was easy to reach, largely because humanitarian aid had been impeded and restricted without evident military necessity or justification under international humanitarian law. When decisions to allow or increase humanitarian aid into Gaza were made, these were conditional. The warrant for Deif, as chief commander of the military wing of Hamas (the al-Qassam Brigades) was issued because the chamber found 'reasonable grounds' to believe he had allegedly been responsible for various crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence) and traditional war crimes. It remains to be seen whether that can be executed appropriately, given the likelihood that Deif is no longer alive. International law remains a curious creature, one of mixed shape and uneven maturity. Being based on the mutual, grudging acknowledgment of conventions between countries, its success, or failure, depends on mutual observance. ICC warrants to arrest international figures have been issued with varying results, with signatory states of the Rome Statute making their own decisions whether to execute them. Political interests can rear a nasty head, blowing off legally minded types keen to see judicial proceedings pursued by member states. When an ICC warrant was issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2023 over the alleged directing of attacks on civilians in Ukraine and the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation, the spectacle of such a figure being hauled off to The Hague was simply too much for countries keen to engage with the Kremlin. Putin, for instance, was assured by Mongolia on a state visit this year that he would not be arrested, despite the country being a party to the ICC. More caution was exercised by Putin regarding the BRICS meeting in Johannesburg in 2023, probably due to such experiences as those of former Sudanese president, Omar Al-Bashir. Despite being the subject of ICC arrest warrants in 2009 and 2010, the defiant leader, wanted for a string of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians in Darfur, tested the waters by visiting South Africa in 2015 for an African Union summit. His presence, however, interested the judicial authorities, who ordered him to stay in South Africa while consideration was given to his potential arrest. Bashir’s exit was prompt, leading to a ruling the following year by the South African Court of Appeal that the failure by the authorities to arrest him was unlawful. A Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC also found that the warrant should have been executed as part of South Africa’s obligations, and the Sudanese leader could not rightly have claimed immunity from arrest during his visit. The warrants against the Israeli figures will have some practical effects. Gallant and Netanyahu will think twice before travelling to member states of the Rome Statute, though such states will naturally reach their own decisions on the issue. But while it is hard to see these men being carted off to proceedings in The Hague bar exceptional circumstances, the warrants have provided a fillip for civil society groups in Israel. The indomitable efforts of the non-profit B’Tselem organisation called the ICC efforts 'a chance for us, Israelis, to realize what we should have understood long ago: that upholding a regime of supremacy, violence and oppression necessarily involves crimes and severe violation of human rights.' Unfortunately for the starving and dying in Gaza, the pity of war will not, at least at this time, halt before any stern judicial eye, especially one cast from an international court.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilL6kQ0Ik1MLS	2024-11-26T09:25:52-08:00	
Special Interest Subsidies Do Not Support The Diverse 8 Billion O...	When governments go into business, citizens start to suffer. When governments support laws that promote a level economic playing field for all in a free enterprise system, citizens prosper. A good example of this is the United States. Under the free enterprise system, this small coalition of little more than 13 disparate colonies grew to become the most imposing industrial power in the world in just over 100 years. Under the system we have today in which government spending picks winners and losers in the business world and hires massive amounts of people, we have amassed an unsupportable debt of more than $100,000 per person. This is beyond the personal debt that is burdening our citizens today. Yet, we still have advocates that want to transfer personal debt to national debt and further burden our posterity. This cannot end well. The poorest American is richer than most of humanity. Of the eight billion now on this planet, more than five billion are living on less than $10.00 a day, and almost half the world — over three billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day, and billions are living with little to no access to electricity. This is the benefit of dictatorships and oligarchies disguised as democratic republics controlling these disadvantaged people. The most important commodities we have today are the products and fuels made from fossil fuels that did not exist 200 years ago Oil produces raw materials for more than 6,000 products manufactured by different industries that are demanded by the 8 billion on this planet. Without oil, all of our products would cost much more. The fossil fuel industry also provides transportation fuels. Today, we have more than 50,000 merchant ships, more than 20,000 commercial aircraft and more than 50,000 military aircraft that use the fuels manufactured from crude oil. The fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of jets moving people and products, and the merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military and space programs, are also dependent on what can be manufactured from crude oil. Those fuels also support the 1.4 billion cars in the world and the 14 million trucks registered in the world. The second most important commodity we have today is electricity. It is the perfect commodity to control on a national level to enhance the boot of oppression on its citizens. Subsidies for continuous, uninterruptible, and dispatchable power from coal, natural gas, and nuclear are JUST for electricity, the same electricity that CANNOT exist without the products and components made from the oil derivatives manufactured from fossil fuels. Subsidies help control the production of electricity in a manner that keeps it scarce and expensive. Most electricity is produced with coal and natural gas. Natural gas is replacing coal, but, beyond that, the mix has not changed much despite the massive subsidies poured into the coffers of those willing to incorporate inefficient and expensive production of electricity in favor of the inexpensive and plentiful sources. This is reflected in the fact that coal and natural gas are producing 95% or more of the proportion of electricity they were even a decade ago. Renewable energy subsidies have driven costs for electricity to double or triple their retail costs in some countries compared to a decade ago, even though quality of air has suffered in that same time frame. Yet many advocate ridding the world of coal, natural gas, and oil no matter how much it costs people. Maybe we ought to rethink this radical and expensive transition. Remember, you the citizens pay for all government expenses, including costs of electricity production infrastructure, whether it is in taxes or direct utility bills. We all know that special interests financially support the Government decision makers, and thus the Government policies financially support the special interests with subsidies. The Press paints these subsidies as 'free money' and we seem to ignore that this money really comes from the poor people and their children. If rich people paid the taxes, they would not remain rich, so it must come from somewhere. Since subsidies come from all of us, maybe we should be careful how we use them. It turns out that most of the subsidies go to foreign businesses, many of which support the exploitation of slave labor to mine for the 'green' minerals and metals to produce the windmills, solar panels, and EV batteries as well as the infliction of environmental degradation to 'their' landscapes just to reinforce mandated EV’s, wind turbines, and solar panels in 'our backyards'! We also pay foreign companies to install them. This reality reveals the imperialistic nature of US politics which exploits the world’s poor people to fuel our desire for luxury. This is patently immoral. The 'renewables' industries would disappear without US government subsidies. Ironically, allowing free enterprise competition to supply your electricity would result in far less costs to the consumer, as it does for all products. In fact, nuclear power is the cheapest and least imposing way to produce electricity when all subsidies are eliminated. This was proven in the 1960s and 1970s throughout the world. Today, China leads the world in the production of new nuclear power plants. Are they seeing something the rest of the world is not? How do countries justify personal power and control of their citizens through a subsidy process that takes money from their people to produce an inferior product and increase their daily expenses? Since the US has taken the lead in all technological advancements during the industrial revolution started in the mid-to-late 1800s, it makes sense that we lead the rest of the world into production of cheap, clean energy using nuclear power. One way to do that would be to petition individual state Governors to show the Federal government how it is done. Compete the production and delivery of electricity like our citizens demanded of the long-distance phone call business. After all, how better would your life be with competitive one cent per kWh electricity over the possibility of one dollar per kWh electricity that data centers would bid for electricity if production stayed the same while their demands soared? When people know the possibilities, the transition to nuclear power will happen quickly. Transition should happen without the elimination of cheap production of electricity through natural gas and coal until the market drives the transition to nuclear power. Imagine the massive increase in quality of life around the world with easily affordable electricity delivered to every household. If the US will not take the lead with a 'New Nuclear Posture for a Hungry world' that is fully supported by Oliver Stone’s 105-minute movie 'NUCLEAR NOW', our adversaries will.

On Rawalpindi’s Imminent Military Campaign In Balochistan – OpEd	When Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong publicly declared that its citizens being 'attacked twice in only six months,' was 'unacceptable,' Pakistan’s Foreign Office reacted by calling this statement 'perplexing.' However, it was abundantly clear that Islamabad had sensed the full import of this not-so-discreet warning from its ‘iron brother.' So, Islamabad’s recent announcement regarding a 'comprehensive military operation against terrorist organisations operating in Balochistan,' comes as no big surprise. There’s no doubt that terrorism needs to be dealt with firmly. However, it's equally important that troops involved in counter-terrorist operations don’t go overboard and act with hatred or vengeance because those who have picked up guns against the state are the soldiers’ countrymen. That’s why professional armies the world have evolved a code of conduct for their rank and file, and soldiers are psychologically conditioned to discharge their duties impartially and without prejudice. The human rights record of the Pakistan army and other security forces under its command however doesn’t quite measure up to expected standards and the reason for this serious shortcoming isn’t too hard to find. Instead of sensitising its rank and file on this issue, the army hierarchy in Pakistan has instead encouraged creation of an environment that encourages animosity towards their countrymen who have for ideological, political or other reasons picked up the gun. To further motivate its soldiers, Rawalpindi has even fallen back on Islamic history. In an attempt to downplay popularity of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan [TTP] terrorist group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP], Pakistan army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir has given it the moniker 'Fitna al-Khawarij,' a name drawn from an early Muslim group that broke away from mainstream Islam. The idea of portraying TTP as a terrorist group that misuses religion to justify the violence it perpetuates and champions objectives that are un-Islamic is laudable. Whereas such a depiction can well arouse religious emotions amongst soldiers and make them feel that they are not professional soldiers but ‘Ghazis’ [defenders of the Faith] and thus sanctify excesses against these so-called ‘enemies of Islam’. Similarly, using the phrase 'sent to Hell' while referring to terrorists killed is in bad taste for many reasons, especially when it comes from an army that prides itself for professionalism and military ethics. First, it’s not humans but our creator who decides the final destination of the deceased and so, the pompous declaration that someone has been ‘sent to Hell’, smacks of arrogance and borders on sacrilege. Secondly, it is universally expected that death should have a very sobering effect on the living and so, even though we may harbour intense hostility towards someone, but once he’s no more, to brag about having sent him to Hell is something that’s downright pathetic! Human Rights Watch [HRW] 2011 report contains an interesting revelation that clearly reveals the sordid side of Pakistan army’s counter-terrorism campaigns. Bashir Azeem, the 76-year old secretary general of Baloch Republican Party [BRP] told HRW investigators that during his 'unacknowledged detention' in 2010, a Pakistani official had told him that 'Even if the president or chief justice tells us to release you, we won’t. We can torture you, or kill you, or keep you for years at our will. It is only the Army chief and the [ISI] chief that we obey.' [Emphasis added]. Even though HRW is a reputed global human rights watch dog and has no axe to grind with Pakistan yet Rawalpindi will undoubtedly rubbish the God-fearing septuagenarian BRP general secretary’s testimony ibid, so purely for the sake of discussion let’s give Pakistan army the benefit of doubt and take its denial at face value. However, will Rawalpindi care to explain what exactly its media chief implied in 2019 when while replying a question on enforced disappearances in Balochistan by saying, 'We don’t want anyone to be missing, but war is ruthless-everything is fair in love and war'? [Emphasis added]. It’s not only rights groups and activists who are critical of the cavalier ways of the Pakistan army and its utter disregard for human right violations in Balochistan as facts speak for themselves. If enforced disappearances in Balochistan are merely a myth [as Rawalpindi maintains], then what impelled Baloch women who traditionally remained within the four walls of their houses to come out and undertake a 1,800 kilometer long March from Turbat near the Iran border to the Pakistani capital followed by a sit-in in peak winter? Defence of Human Rights Pakistan [DHRP] is an independent organisation working for release of illegally detained Pakistani citizens headed by Amina Janjua, a half-widow whose husband was forcibly disappeared in 2005. When all efforts to trace him proved futile, instead of approaching the police or judiciary, Ms Janjua ultimately sought the help of Pakistan army’s media chief in 2019. If the Pakistan army isn’t complicit in orchestrating enforced disappearances in Balochistan, then why did the knowledgeable DHRP chairperson choose to specifically approach a Pakistan army General for help? Pakistan army’s impending campaign in Balochistan will be a bloody one. While on the one hand Baloch fighters are a determined lot and will fight till the end, the Pakistan army on the other hand will use every ground based and aerial weapon platform at its disposal to pulverise what it believes are terrorist hideouts. Since it’s not accountable to anyone, Rawalpindi will not hesitate in targeting areas inhabited by innocent civilians. Furthermore, imposition of media censorship purportedly for ‘operational reasons’ will ensure that [like always] news of atrocities committed by the Pakistan army remain unreported. How will things pan out in Balochistan once the military campaign commences isn’t very difficult to prognose. Pakistan army will definitely suffer casualties and in order to keep up its own image as well as assuage public anger it will have to produce dead bodies of the attackers, ensuring that they exceed the number of soldiers killed. Rawalpindi is also under severe pressure to do something that would placate Beijing, which is enraged by attacks on Chinese citizens by Baloch fighters. The Pakistan army knows that the easiest way to do this is to create the illusion of having decisively crushed the Baloch separatist movement by producing a surfeit of body bags containing mortal remains of sarmachars [Baloch insurgents] as evidence thereof. The only problem is that abducting innocent Baloch youth, murdering them in cold blood and then presenting them as Baloch fighters could lead to widespread public unrest but with years of experience, Rawalpindi has already worked out an alternative. More than 2,500 Baloch men have been forcibly disappeared by the Pakistan army and its intelligence agencies and even we assume that 50 percentage have been secretly murdered, there are still enough Baloch people lodged in secret jails to cater for the requisite number of corpses to cool down Beijing’s frayed temper and public outrage would be an easy job. As such, resorting to rampant abductions and producing their corpses for 'pushing up' the number of casualties inflicted by the army won't be necessary. Though repugnant, this endeavour is a win-win situation for the Pakistan army because dead men tell no tales! Postscript: Excesses committed by the Pakistan army against the Baloch people would even make the most stone-hearted squirm with horror and revulsion. In an undated video that definitely predates his short lived honeymoon with Rawalpindi, PTI chief Imran Khan can be heard saying, 'Our army [is] bombing people in Balochistan,how can we bomb our own people, is there any army [there that] you are bombing? It is our own people with their children, but it is important to understand are we just bombing our people, just think about the sin of bombing villages with the women and children…You are talking about six million people in the tribal areas that are being bombed, their economy has been shattered, they are living in refugee camps, how are they sustaining, and what about the extra-judicial killing that is going on'? [Emphasis added]. This is unfortunately the raw reality of Pakistan army military campaigns in Balochistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilCRsehwduQ-7	2024-11-26T09:20:57-08:00	
The Israel-Lebanon Conflict: Urgent Global Intervention Needed – ...	Recent hostilities between Israel and Lebanon have escalated into a deadly crisis, capturing the world’s attention and raising urgent calls for international accountability. As Israeli airstrikes devastate parts of Lebanon and Hezbollah retaliates with relentless aggression, the death toll has surged past 492, with no end in sight. This conflict, steeped in historical grievances and geopolitical rivalry, demands immediate action to avert further humanitarian and regional catastrophe. The roots of this clash are deeply entrenched in decades of animosity between Israel and Hezbollah. Over time, Lebanon has become a proxy battleground, where regional and international powers pursue their agendas at the expense of innocent civilians. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, represents a persistent threat in Israel’s eyes, and sporadic clashes have now exploded into a full-scale confrontation. This dispute transcends territorial disagreements; it reflects a broader struggle for dominance and ideological survival in a volatile region. Regional dynamics have played a critical role in fueling the violence. Hezbollah’s influence, viewed as an extension of Tehran’s power, remains a source of concern for Israel and its Western allies. At the same time, Lebanon’s political and economic fragility has left its government powerless to manage Hezbollah’s actions or shield its people from Israeli strikes. Calls for restraint by influential actors like Saudi Arabia and Egypt are complicated by their own alliances and strategic interests, further undermining efforts for resolution. On the global stage, the response to this crisis has been tepid and insufficient. While the United Nations and prominent leaders have voiced concern and urged de-escalation, there has been little concrete action. Diplomatic efforts in the past have often failed to bring about lasting peace, and the current situation underscores the urgency for meaningful global intervention. Powers such as the United States and Russia, both deeply invested in the region, must set aside military interests to prioritize peace-building and stability. The toll on civilians has been devastating. Lebanese families, already grappling with economic hardships, now face relentless bombardment and widespread destruction. Essential infrastructure, from hospitals to schools, has been crippled. Meanwhile, Israelis endure the constant fear of Hezbollah’s rocket fire. The human cost of this conflict is immense, and immediate humanitarian aid is crucial to support those caught in the crossfire. Relief agencies must be empowered to provide food, shelter, and medical assistance to affected communities on both sides of the border. Despite growing calls for a ceasefire, the cycle of violence persists. Israeli leaders have vowed to continue their military campaign until Hezbollah’s capabilities are neutralized, while Hezbollah, emboldened by regional backing, frames itself as a defender of Lebanese sovereignty and Palestinian rights. This unrelenting exchange of hostilities threatens not only regional stability but also the prospects for lasting peace in the Middle East. The principles of international law and human rights provide a critical lens through which to examine this conflict. Israel’s actions, justified as self-defense, must still comply with humanitarian laws that prohibit disproportionate force and mandate the protection of civilians. At the same time, Hezbollah’s indiscriminate rocket attacks targeting Israeli non-combatants constitute clear violations of international norms. Both sides must be held accountable for their actions to prevent further erosion of the rule of law. A sustainable solution to this conflict requires robust diplomatic engagement. While past negotiations have failed due to political entanglements and external interference, the need for a multilateral approach has never been more pressing. Regional stakeholders, along with international organizations, must facilitate dialogue that addresses core issues of security, sovereignty, and territorial rights. The 2006 UN-brokered ceasefire offers a framework, but it must be strengthened with mechanisms for enforcement and sustained commitment to peace. The Arab world, too, bears a shared responsibility in resolving this crisis. A unified and proactive approach by Middle Eastern nations is essential to curb further bloodshed and instability. The normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab states through the Abraham Accords presents both opportunities and challenges. While these agreements signify a shift in regional dynamics, they must not detract from addressing the underlying grievances fueling the Israel-Lebanon conflict. The international community must also recognize the broader implications of inaction. This conflict serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of peace in a region riddled with historical rivalries and unresolved disputes. Without immediate and decisive action, the suffering of civilians will intensify, and the potential for regional escalation will grow. In conclusion, the unfolding crisis between Israel and Lebanon underscores the need for urgent global intervention. Diplomatic rhetoric must translate into tangible actions that prioritize human lives and uphold international law. The world cannot afford to stand idle while the cycle of violence continues to claim innocent lives. It is only through restraint, humanitarian support, and a commitment to long-term peace that the region can hope for a stable and secure future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdP4qD9Js5ilBXImImev-nK	2024-11-26T09:19:14-08:00	
Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) – Analysis	By Jennifer DiMascio Background The U.S. Army is developing the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) to serve as a next-generation aircraft for vertical lift, air assault, maritime interdiction, aeromedical evacuation, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, and tactical resupply. The Army intends for FLRAA to eventually replace the Sikorsky UH- 60 Black Hawk medium-utility helicopter, which was designed more than 50 years ago. Army Futures Command Commanding General James E. Rainey testified that the Army needs FLRAA to have the ability to fly twice as far and twice as fast as previous rotorcraft, a capability he called essential for operations in the Pacific region. The Army is under contract with Textron Bell to build a FLRAA prototype of its V-280 demonstrator aircraft. The Administration has asked Congress for $1.26 billion for FLRAA research, development, test, and evaluation in FY2025 (see Table 1). UH-60 Black Hawk The Army plans to begin operating FLRAA in the 2030s and, in the meantime, continue to purchase Black Hawk helicopters. According to Army budget documents, the UH- 60M is 'the Army’s utility helicopter for the near and midterm force,' supporting maneuver commanders in airassault, general support command and control, and aeromedical evacuation. The Administration’s FY2025 budget request proposes continuing the purchase of 24 Black Hawks annually under a five-year contract that began in 2022 and ends in 2026. The service may also follow through on another multiyear proposal to purchase up to 255 UH-60s from FY2027 to FY2031. The Black Hawk is operated by at least 35 governments. Future Vertical Lift FLRAA is one component of the Army’s plan—launched in 2009—to modernize its aviation assets. That Army effort, called Future Vertical Lift (FVL), focused on replacing Cold War-era aircraft with rotorcraft that could fly more supplies, faster, for longer distances, more reliably, and with less logistical support. That plan took on even greater relevance as the U.S. military turned its attention to potential conflict with China and Russia, which have advanced air defenses that would force the United States to operate at longer ranges. Under FVL, the Army had intended to develop FLRAA, a Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), and two new Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) programs. The Army proposed canceling FARA in its FY2025 budget request. The Army plans for FLRAA’s and FVL’s UASprograms to continue. (See CRS In Focus IF12592, Army Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Program Proposed Cancellation: Background and Issues for Congress, by Jennifer DiMascio.) To achieve 'transformational increases in speed, range, and maneuverability,' the Army is seeking FLRAA, an aircraft that would cruise at speeds of up to 280 knots—compared with the Black Hawk’s cruising speed of 151 knots. The Army states FLRAA should fly with up to 12 passengers for at least 1,700 nautical miles (nm) without refueling. FLRAA should be able to fly at altitudes of 6,000 ft., and up to 95-degree heat. In 2014, the Army awarded initial contracts to Bell and a Sikorsky-Boeing team, marking the start of a FLRAA competition. Each team produced a demonstrator, from which the Army could select a vendor that would produce an eventual prototype aircraft. Bell developed a V-280 Valor demonstrator, which flew for the first time in December 2017. Sikorsky and Boeing built the SB-1 Defiant X demonstrator, a compound helicopter that uses twin coaxial rotors for lift and a pusher propeller to generate speed. The Defiant flew for the first time in March 2019. In 2022, the Army awarded a $1.3 billion contract to Bell Textron to deliver by 2025 a digital FLRAA prototype based on the firm’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor aircraft. Sikorsky challenged the contract award, but the Government Accountability Office (GAO) upheld the Army’s decision, citing Sikorsky’s failure to adequately address a requirement for a modular open system architecture (MOSA) that would allow for faster, easier software upgrades. Congress in the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2017 and 2021 (P.L. 114-328 §805 and P.L. 116- 283 §804) required major defense acquisition programs to adopt a MOSA approach. Bell V-280 The V-280 uses a tiltrotor design. Tiltrotors can take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then tilt their rotor blades forward to fly like an airplane. The U.S. Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force operate another tiltrotor aircraft, the V-22 Osprey. Bell chose a more conventional design for the V-280 compared with the V-22, according to an industry official. For example, the clutch design on the V-280 is simpler, and the V-280 has a straight wing, which eliminates the need for the kind of mid-wing gearbox that exists on the V-22. Bell has teamed with Rolls-Royce on a propulsion system for the V-280: two Rolls-Royce AE1107F turboshafts, the same engine as the V-22. Other FLRAA subcontractors include Spirit AeroSystems (composite fuselage); Safran (landing gear); Moog (flight-control computers and other components); GE Aerospace (common open architecture, digital backbone, voice and data recorder, and health awareness system); and Astronics Corporation Electrical (power and distribution system). Program Status The Army says its FY2025 budget request would fund activities for FLRAA engineering and management and development. Among other things, the funds would continue development of a digital backbone with an underlying structure that meets the Army’s MOSA objectives. As stated above, the Army prioritized an open system approach to the FLRAA program to ease future sustainment, facilitate software upgrades, and connect more easily with other sensors and weapons. In May 2024, the Army designated FLRAA as a 'pathfinder program,' one that would set an example for how to implement digital engineering to achieve those goals. U.S. Special Operations Command has reportedly contributed to design discussions and requested the FLRAA include space on the aircraft to house a specialized radar in the nose, add hardware for a refueling probe, and other modifications. On August 2, 2024, the Army announced that FLRAA had entered the Milestone B engineering and manufacturing development phase, following a successful preliminary design review in April and an Army Systems Acquisition Review Council meeting in June. The service said the Milestone B decision allowed the Army to exercise the first of nine contract options, including the detailed design and build of six prototype aircraft. The first FLRAA prototype flight is planned for 2026. Low-rate initial production would then follow in 2028, with initial fielding of aircraft planned for 2030. FLRAA Funding The House-passed version of the FY2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the FY2025 NDAA, and versions of the FY2025 Defense Appropriations Act passed by the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommend fully funding the Administration’s request for FLRAA research, development, test, and evaluation in FY2025. Considerations for Congress Oversight by Congress may include the following: Army officials have stated that future attack aircraft should be flown without humans in the cockpit. Other industry officials say that human pilots will always have a role on the battlefield. Members of Congress could conduct hearings or discussions about the need for human pilots, which could affect the future of the FLRAA program. Congress may continue oversight of experimental efforts for FLRAA to work with other platforms, including Air-Launched Effects. ALE could be a swarm of small UAS that could provide surveillance, target tracking, jamming, or communications to expand the FVL’s ability to operate in contested environments. The Army is continuing to manufacture UH-60 Black Hawks for its own use and use by foreign governments. Members of Congress may consider the feasibility and budgetary implications of modernizing the Black Hawk alongside the creation of the new FLRAA platform. Some Members have expressed concern about the choice of a tiltrotor aircraft, pointing to recent fatal accidents involving V-22 Osprey aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee in S.Rept. 118-204 'encourages' Army officials in charge of aviation to collaborate with Navy officials on lessons learned about development and operation of tiltrotor aircraft that might be applied to the FLRAA. Congress may examine whether or not that has taken place and what resulted. Congress also may consider oversight of whether FLRAA meets the Navy’s needs for a Future Vertical Lift-Maritime Strike platform.

Tajikistan’s Afghan Conundrum – Analysis	By Bruce Pannier (FPRI) -- Tajikistan’s policies toward neighboring Taliban-ruled Afghanistan are reaching a pivotal moment. Tajik President Emomali Rahmon and his government have always viewed the Taliban as a threat, and that position has not changed since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. However, there is a bigger threat to Tajikistan growing in Afghanistan, and it might take cooperation with the Taliban to neutralize it. Additionally, the other Central Asian countries and China, Iran, and Russia are engaging with the Taliban government. Tajikistan risks missing out on opportunities that these countries are opening in Afghanistan. Following the lead of these countries presents Tajikistan with a different set of problems. Tajik authorities have been warning the country’s people and the international community about the Taliban threat for nearly 30 years. Tajikistan’s rigid stance against the Taliban government has brought Rahmon’s government support from Tajikistan’s people and other countries. Making peace with the Taliban will be difficult to explain to Tajik citizens. It will also remove one of the greatest incentives for foreign governments to continue decades of generous financial and security support for Rahmon’s government. Enemies from the Start President Rahmon is unique among the current leaders of countries bordering Afghanistan. He is the only leader who was in power when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, all the Central Asian presidents, except the Turkmen president, viewed the Taliban as a threat and shunned any contact with them. Rahmon’s government and the government of Uzbekistan’s then-President Islam Karimov aided ethnic Tajik and Uzbek groups fighting the Taliban in northern Afghanistan. The potential danger from the Taliban was acutely felt in Tajikistan where there was civil war from 1992 to 1997. The Rahmon government’s battlefield opponent was the United Tajik Opposition, a coalition of groups in which the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) was the backbone. In the early years after the Taliban appeared, most people knew little about the group except that they were Islamic extremists. Rahmon had reason to be one of the strongest critics of the Taliban. Other governments alarmed at the Taliban’s advance through Afghanistan also saw that Tajikistan, the poorest Central Asian country emerging from a five-year civil war, needed assistance to ensure the Taliban could not find a foothold or sympathizers inside Tajikistan. The Taliban and other militant groups continued operating in northern Afghanistan after foreign forces entered the country. Tajikistan became a frontline in the war on terror, and Rahmon realized that warning about threats from Afghanistan prompted countries and organizations to send additional finances and security assistance. His continued opposition to the Taliban after August 2021 earned Rahmon invitations to visit the European Parliament and France in October 2021. A Safer Border Tajikistan’s government is slowly opening ties with the Taliban. The first reported contact occurred after militants from the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) launched several rockets from northern Afghanistan into Tajikistan on May 7, 2022. Former Tajik security officer Samariddin Chuyanzoda traveled to Kabul on May 14 to meet with Taliban representatives. The Taliban were facing sporadic attacks from ISK before foreign troops departed Afghanistan, and those attacks continue to this day. The Taliban claim that, among the ISK militants they have killed or captured in the last three years, some are citizens of Tajikistan. Just weeks before Chuyanzoda made his trip to Kabul, ISK increased its recruiting propaganda in the Tajik language, targeting Tajiks in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. There are also the militants of Jamaat Ansarullah, a terrorist group originating in Tajikistan that allied themselves with the Taliban during the final years foreign forces were in Afghanistan. During the first months after the Taliban’s recapture of Afghanistan when the Tajik government and Taliban were exchanging threats, the Taliban stationed Jamaat Ansarullah militants, freshly armed with US weapons seized by the Taliban when they took control of Afghanistan. According to reports in February 2024, Tajik and Taliban officials met at the request of Tajikistan toward the end of 2023 to discuss what to do with the Jamaat Ansarullah fighters. Tajik authorities reportedly wanted the Jamaat Ansarullah militants extradited to Tajikistan. The Taliban instead offered to act as a mediator in negotiations between the two groups. Jamaat Ansarullah’s leadership said they would only talk if the Tajik government met several unreasonable—for Tajik authorities—conditions including declaring Tajikistan an Islamic state and removing Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan. However, contact between Tajik and the Taliban had been established. As recently as August 2024, Saimumin Yatimov, the leader of Tajikistan’s security service, visited Kabul to reportedly discuss strengthening ties between Tajikistan and the Taliban. Aside from militants, Tajikistan risks being left out of trade routes through Afghanistan that are being planned or already slowly opening. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have all been working with Taliban officials to improve connectivity between Central Asia and Afghanistan and hopefully extend proposed trade routes to Iran and the Arabian Sea. Among these projects are the Trans-Afghan railway connecting Uzbekistan (and through Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries) to Pakistan, a railway from Kazakhstan through Turkmenistan and on to Herat, Afghanistan with spurs to Iran or continuing through Afghanistan to Kandahar and Spin Boldak on the Pakistani border. Another proposed railway is the 250-mile Tajikistan–Afghanistan–Turkmenistan (TAT) line. That project dates back more than a decade. However, in August 2024, Tajikistan’s Transport Ministry signed a protocol with the Korea International Cooperation Agency for a feasibility study for the 30-mile Tajik section of the railway. Tajik Transport Minister Azim Ibrohim said the line would connect Tajikistan to markets in South Asia, and acting South Korean Ambassador to Tajikistan Jeon Sung-sik said the railway would 'enable Tajikistan to access maritime routes and become a crucial link in international transportation.' China has shown interest in this route also as part of a multimodal trade route that passes through eastern Tajikistan to the Chinese border by road. Tajikistan has continued to export electricity to Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power. The power transmission lines were built during the years foreign troops were in Afghanistan and in the months after the Taliban seized control, Tajikistan’s electricity shipments to Afghanistan were one of the only links preserved with Tajikistan’s southern neighbor. The Taliban said early on that they would pay for the electricity, and they have kept their word. In February 2024, the World Bank announced construction of the Central Asia–South Asia (CASA-1000) power line had resumed. CASA-1000 aims to use hydropower plants in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to bring one thousand megawatts (MW) of electricity to Pakistan and 300 MW to Afghanistan. The Trade-Off Afghanistan has been a constant source of concern since Tajikistan became independent in 1991. For Tajikistan, an amicable understanding with the Taliban represents an unprecedented sense of security plus economic and trade opportunities. There are complications, however. Rahmon has repeatedly called the Taliban a threat to the security of Tajikistan and Central Asia more broadly for 30 years. Rahmon has mentioned the plight of ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power and called for an inclusive government. Those remarks have earned Rahmon some rare widespread public support in Tajikistan. How would Rahmon explain to his people that the Taliban can be a partner to Tajikistan? Underscoring the sensitivity of this problem, Rahmon banned the IRPT saying they were a terrorist group. Before being banned, the IRPT was the second largest political party in Tajikistan, behind Rahmon’s People’s Democratic Party of Tajikistan. The 1997 Tajik Peace Accord appointed IRPT representatives to government positions. Until 2015, the IRPT had deputies in the lower house of the Tajik parliament. The IRPT is far more moderate than the ultra-Orthodox Taliban whose brutal rule of the late 1990s has carried over into the current regime. So how can the IRPT be such a threat? And how can the Taliban be a party with which Tajik authorities can associate? More importantly, the Tajik government has profited greatly from being a neighbor to unstable and menacing Afghanistan. Tajikistan has always been donor dependent and has received generous help largely because it has been a frontline against Islamic radicalism coming out of Afghanistan. Social programs, education, water purification, energy projects, and more have been funded by international organizations and individual countries. Part of the reason for this aid was to improve the socioeconomic situation in Tajikistan and strengthen the resolve of the country’s people against the lure of groups such as the Taliban or ISK. Security cooperation is probably the key benefit Tajikistan has received. On September 1, 2021, the US Embassy in Tajikistan posted on its website that a US-funded project had just launched to build new facilities for a Tajik border guard unit stationed along the Afghan frontier. The statement said some of the new additions 'will allow the Border Patrol to quickly deploy forces to border areas in response to threats.' The statement noted that, since 2002, the US government spent more than $300 million to repair or reconstruct 12 border posts, nine border crossings, and three training centers for border guards. The US has also provided nonlethal aid to Tajikistan’s border guards including border surveillance, night-vision equipment, jeeps, quadbikes, and sniffer dogs. The European Union as a body and individual countries within the EU, NATO, Russia, China, and other parties have also provided military equipment and uniforms and built facilities for border forces. Conclusion If the Tajik government and Taliban can reach a durable truce and establish some form of cooperation, the threat level for Tajikistan diminishes. The concerns of foreign governments and organizations for Tajikistan’s security also subside. Peace with the Taliban could significantly reduce the amount of foreign financial and security assistance Tajikistan has become accustomed to seeing. In an odd contradiction, instability in Afghanistan has been good for Rahmon’s government. However, harsh stability in Afghanistan imposed by the Taliban could halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that has been propping up the Tajik government for three decades.

G20 Economies Should Target Reforms To Boost Medium-Term Growth P...	For most Group of Twenty economies, growth is poised to weaken over the next five years and remain well below what was typical in the two decades before the pandemic. That’s one of the biggest shared challenges for the group, which accounts for about 85 percent of global gross domestic product. Growth is more robust across the African Union, which joined the G20 last year, but booming populations mean those economies also must create jobs for millions of young people entering the labor market. For both groups, as well as the European Union, lifting growth is essential to improving outcomes for people, and there's a common solution: implementing priority reforms can significantly boost prospects for growth over the next five years, or medium term, as our new report to the G20 outlines. Our analysis also indicates that payoffs from structural reforms are greatest when they are carefully sequenced and reflect social consensus. Various challenges underscore why it’s time to invest in growth-enhancing reforms. Subdued productivity growth, reinforced in some countries by adverse demographic trends, holds back potential growth, as Chapter 3 of the April 2024 World Economic Outlook details. Sustainable growth also is imperiled by elevated public debt, and increased geoeconomic fragmentation and protectionism. As the Chart of the Week shows, the biggest priority across countries in these groups is reforming fiscal policy frameworks to aid lasting consolidation of government budgets. Specifically, most G20 advanced economies and several EU economies would benefit from tighter public spending limits, while for most G20 emerging market and developing economies reforms to boost government revenues should be prioritized. Several African Union countries could benefit from enhanced fiscal transparency. For many G20 and African Union economies, there are two other key areas for high priority structural reforms. First, the quality of education and skill training must be improved to better match skills with job opportunities. Second, reforms to accelerate the energy transition are essential, such as improving renewable energy capacity, enhancing the carbon tax efficacy, and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. In several African Union economies, governance reforms are also urgently needed to strengthen the rule of law, fight corruption and improve public finance management.

Manila Takes A Bold Stance On The South China Sea – Analysis	By Edcel John A Ibarra The Philippines’ new ‘unyielding’ foreign policy on the South China Sea seems to be unsettling ASEAN. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has launched a transparency initiative that exposes China’s illegal aggression in the South China Sea. The Philippines has also strengthened its defence cooperation with the United States and allied countries and has begun exploring military agreements with new partners. Altogether, these moves are viewed as undermining ASEAN neutrality and non-alignment. While similar criticisms may be levelled against other ASEAN members, ASEAN remains neutral and non-aligned despite the Philippines’ policy shift. ASEAN is known for not choosing sides among the great powers, but this is not because each member adheres strictly to neutrality and non-alignment. Some members are known to have chosen sides because of geographic, historical or economic factors. These diverse national-level stances contribute to ASEAN’s overarching neutrality and non-alignment. If ASEAN imposed neutrality and non-alignment to all members, it would contravene its core norm of non-interference and cause internal disagreements. Given that no ASEAN member has been strictly neutral and non-aligned, the terms are also nebulous. On the South China Sea issue, ASEAN countries are binding themselves to strict interpretations. Legal and historical definitions of neutrality and non-alignment do not prevent ASEAN from speaking out against China’s maritime assertiveness. Under the Law of Neutrality, states do not lose their neutral status when they verbally condemn a belligerent state, as long as they do not materially assist the other side. Similarly, under the Bandung Principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, states are justified in calling out aggression against their territorial integrity. Neutrality and non-alignment are compatible with taking a principled stance, but ASEAN still often settles for watered-down language or silence. Since ASEAN is known to be pragmatic rather than principled, the Philippines is fulfilling a function that no other member would dare—enforcing the norm of a rules-based maritime order. The Philippines’ transparency initiative and its public rebukes of China’s aggression work towards this goal. While these strategies are seen as increasing tensions, if the Philippines remains silent on the South China Sea, the rules-based maritime order it seeks would be endangered. Public rebukes against China help Filipinos internalise the norm, making it politically costly for future Philippine administrations to ignore it. Rebukes also help during norm cascades. Ridicule and constant reminders of a norm’s parameters should make deviations less likely in the long term, if not by China, then at least by other states. If this function were left to the United States or a Western power, rivalry with China would intensify, making it important that rebukes come from the region. The Philippines’ decision to re-embrace the United States must be understood against the backdrop of China’s maritime assertiveness and ASEAN’s unwillingness to stand up against it. A different policy might have emerged from Manila if China had tempered its aggression and ASEAN offered stronger support. Early in his presidency, Marcos sought to continue his predecessor’s friendliness toward China. But China’s aggression has made this policy untenable. Without a long-overdue ASEAN–China code of conduct in the South China Sea, future Philippine presidents will find themselves defending the Philippines’ maritime rights as affirmed by the arbitration award. Though often forgetten now, the Philippines’ policy U-turn began during the last two years of president Rodrigo Duterte’s leadership. Duterte had to deal with increasing incidents with China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, culminating in the retraction of the cancellation of a key military agreement with Washington, keeping the alliance alive. The Philippines’ re-embrace of the United States is not external interference. In the South China Sea, the United States is not an external party. While it is not a claimant of territorial or maritime space, it is a claimaint of maritime rights. Insofar as China’s actions threaten these universal maritime rights, Washington and the rest of the world are dispuntants in the South China Sea. Policymakers in Manila believe that some form of military balance is needed but because the country’s armed forces are weak and ASEAN will not commit to a common defence posture, the remaining option is to make the most of the Philippines’ longstanding alliance with the United States. Some fear that this risks turning the South China Sea into a militarised zone—but even without the United States, it already is. The Philippines is not relying solely on the United States. It has been courting new strategic partners since 2010, a policy which Marcos has continued. The Philippines has three other strategic partners—Japan, Vietnam and Australia. Like other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines is hedging, but only with states that share its principles. If ASEAN feels unsettled by the Philippines’ recent actions, it has itself to blame. As the region navigates the US–China rivalry, the diversity of responses emerging from within ASEAN will prove beneficial. Rather than equating this diversity with disunity, it may be better interpreted through the logic of pluralism—instead of seeking unity for unity’s sake, each country should be free to contribute to order-building in ASEAN as they see fit.

Who Is Calin Georgescu, The Far-Right Winner Of Romania’s Preside...	By Tony Wesolowsky and RFE/RL's Romanian Service (RFE/RL) -- Experts had tipped a far-right candidate as one of the favorites in Romania's presidential election, predicting a runoff with an established politician in a poll monitored closely as a barometer of populism in Europe and eroding public support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. The experts were right and wrong. Yes, a far-right candidate will go to Romania's presidential runoff on December 8. But it wasn't the one they and polls were predicting. Calin Georgescu, an independent who barely registered in pre-election polling, not only did better than expected: The 62-year-old agricultural engineer won the November 24 first round with about 22 percent of the vote. The race for second place turned into a drama of its own. The leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) was in a tight race with Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union, a pro-Western liberal. With 99.9 percent of the vote counted, it was Lasconi, an ardent backer of Romania's membership in NATO and the EU as well as a vocal supporter of Ukraine, who emerged as the second-place finisher. Disappointment With Liberal Incumbent Thirteen candidates ran for the presidency in the European Union and NATO member country. The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy, and judicial appointments. Romania will also hold parliamentary elections on December 1 that will determine the country's next government and prime minister. The outgoing center-right incumbent, Klaus Iohannis, ends his second term after a decade in office. For many voters, he and his ruling National Liberal Party have been a disappointment, with Iohannis widely criticized for his figurative absence during crucial events such as the coronavirus pandemic. Voter concerns included corruption, inflation, and the state of the health and education sectors. Another issue was the conflict in neighboring Ukraine and how that conflict could change with a switch in Washington from U.S. President Joe Biden, who has steadily backed Kyiv, to President-elect Donald Trump, who has suggested support could be curtailed. Romania has become a key ally of Ukraine, not only providing training and military equipment, including a Patriot missile defense system, but playing a key role in transporting Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods to global markets. Much of the credit for Bucharest's pro-Ukraine stance goes to the incumbent, Iohannis. Surprise Win But it was Georgescu's surprise showing that grabbed headlines. Ahead of the vote, experts were focused on a different far-right figure. Opinion polls showed that George Simion, leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), was in second or even first place. Analysts had expected Simion, a vocal supporter of Trump, to face Ciolacu in the second round. Simion has campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from neighboring Ukraine. Georgescu was also a prominent member of AUR, which had picked him as their choice for prime minister. But he left the party in 2022 amid criticism from senior AUR leaders that his pro-Russian, anti-NATO stance was detrimental to the party's image. In a 2021 interview, he called NATO's ballistic missile defense shield in Deveselu, southern Romania, a 'shame of diplomacy,' claiming the military alliance would not defend any of its members in case of a Russian attack. He has also said Ion Antonescu, Romania's de facto World War II leader who was sentenced to death for his part in Romania's Holocaust, and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the pre-World War II leader of the Iron Guard -- one of Europe's most violent anti-Semitic movements -- were national heroes. Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania's Environment Ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program. TikTok Campaign Like other fringe politicians, Georgescu is savvy with social media. His TikTok account had 1.6 million likes. On it, he has posted videos of himself attending church, doing judo, running on a track, and speaking on podcasts. Just days before the vote, Georgescu launched a TikTok campaign calling for an end to aid for Ukraine, apparently striking a chord with voters. He has also sounded a skeptical note on Romania's NATO membership. His anti-Western messaging is routinely amplified on Russian, state-run media and Kremlin-friendly social media. After casting his ballot, Georgescu said in a post on Facebook that he voted 'for the unjust, for the humiliated, for those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.... The vote is a prayer for the nation.' His other stances include supporting Romanian farmers, reducing dependency on imports, and ramping up energy and food production. Simion said he congratulated Georgescu and that he was 'very happy that approximately 40 percent of the votes of Romanians went toward the sovereign option' and that he would be in the second round. The runoff vote on December 8 will offer a stark choice between Georgescu and Lasconi, who among the leading candidates was the most bullish on Romania's membership in the EU and NATO, even calling for a greater NATO presence in Romania. Lasconi was also the only leading candidate to reject Ukraine making territorial concessions to secure peace.

Could An Increase In The Supply Of Gold Cause A Boom-Bust Cycle? ...	By Frank Shostak According to the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT), the artificial increase in the money supply via central bank expansionary monetary policy lowers the market interest rate. This, in turn, causes the market interest rate to deviate from the natural rate, determined by the market. Consequently, this leads to the boom-bust cycle. Understanding this, on the gold standard, where money is gold and—assuming that there is no central bank—an increase in the supply of gold will also result in the lowering of the market interest rates. This would cause a deviation of the market interest rates from the previous interest rate. Consequently, this is going to set in motion a boom-bust cycle. This means that even on the gold standard, without the central bank, we could still have boom-bust cycles. According to Murphy, 'The unsustainable boom occurs when a newly created (or mined) quantity of money enters the loan market and distorts interest rates, before other prices in the economy have had time to adjust. In principle, this process could occur even in the case of commodity money with 100 percent reserve banking.' Note again, according to Murphy, the increase in the supply of gold also could set the boom-bust cycle in motion, though Mises believed, in practice, this theoretical possibility would have a negligible effect. Murray Rothbard disagreed with this. He held that increases in the supply of gold could not set in motion the boom-bust cycle. For him, the key reason behind the boom-bust cycle is the act of embezzlement brought about by the expansionary monetary policy of the central bank, which sets in motion an increase in the money supply out of 'thin air.' According to Rothbard, 'Inflation, in this work, is explicitly defined to exclude increases in the stock of specie. While these increases have such similar effects as raising the prices of goods, they also differ sharply in other effects: (a) simple increases in specie do not constitute an intervention in the free market, penalizing one group and subsidizing another; and (b) they do not lead to the processes of the business cycle.' Following this reasoning, what uniquely sets the boom-bust cycle into motion is the artificial, inflationary increase in the money supply. The increase in this type of money sets an exchange of nothing for something (i.e., the diversion of wealth from wealth-generators to non-wealth-generators and their projects). The expansionary policy of the central bank impoverishes wealth producers and enriches first possessors of the newly-created money and credit. For Rothbard, then, the boom-bust cycle emerges because of the expansionary policies of the central bank, which set in motion the act of embezzlement. A major contributor to the inflationary process is commercial bank credit expansion. This type of credit is facilitated by the expansionary monetary policy of the central bank. This expansionary monetary policy produces false economic prosperity—the economic boom. When the limited savings come under pressure because of the false economic boom, banks start to accumulate non-performing assets. Consequently, they necessarily slow the expansion of artificial credit. As a rule—pressured by increasing price inflation—central bank’s also respond by tightening monetary policy. The unsound investments and ventures, dependent on loose artificial monetary policy, cannot survive the monetary contraction. An economic bust results. It is the act of fraud which sets the boom-bust cycle into motion via inflationary additions to the money supply. This artificial expansion of money and credit is also responsible for price inflation. Gold and the Boom-Bust Cycle? The reason why miners mine gold is because there is a market for it. Gold contributes to the subjective well-being of individuals. In this sense, it is part of the pool of wealth. Now over time, individuals have discovered that gold—being originally useful in making jewelry—has a great appeal as the medium of the exchange. As a result, they may begin to assign a much greater exchange-value to gold than before. Hence, the increase in the supply of gold amounts to the increase in wealth, distinct from the inherently artificial nature of inflation. When a producer of gold exchanges it for goods, he is engaging in the exchange of something for something. He is exchanging wealth for wealth. New gold in a system requires production and/or exchange. Phony Warehouse Receipts, Fiat Money, or Fiduciary Media Cause Boom-Bust Cycles Contrast this with the unbacked by gold 'receipts' that are used as the medium of the exchange. These receipts were issued without the corresponding gold deposited for safekeeping. These receipts generate the same outcome as the counterfeit money does, yet on a much larger scale. This sets the stage for increased consumption without contributing to production or savings. Unbacked fiat certificates set in motion an exchange of nothing for something which, in turn, distorts the price-structure and the structure of production and leads to boom-bust cycles. This also sets the stage for widespread embezzlement once these certificates are employed in an exchange for goods and services. Through the signals from the increased purchasing and investments, this creates an artificial economic boom. Once this process slows down or stops altogether, it halts the diversion of wealth to various activities that emerged because of inflation. As a result, these activities come under pressure and an economic bust results. Without the inflation of money and credit, which divert wealth to them, these economic activities are in trouble. Without easy money, they cannot survive or continue at the same current rate. By contrast, in the case of an increase in the supply of gold, no fraud is committed here. The supplier of gold—the gold mine—has increased the production of a demanded commodity. Therefore, in this case there is not an exchange of nothing for something. The gold producer, by producing something demanded in the market, can exchange it for other goods. He does not create empty money to fraudulently divert wealth to himself. We can thus conclude that the gold standard, if not abused, is not conducive of boom-bust cycles. The gold standard has nothing to do with embezzlement. That said, the inflationary increase in the money supply and the increase in the supply of gold are going to generate a change in price relations and possibly the market interest rate. This addition of gold does not set the boom-bust cycle. A boom-bust cycle, by its nature, is generated by artificial additions to the money supply. If the interest rate change is due to an increase in the supply of gold, which is an increase in wealth, no boom-bust cycle is going to emerge. Cantillon effects, however, will result. An increase in the supply of gold can cause the prices and the market interest rate to change and this is likely to cause fluctuations in economic activity. However, boom-bust cycles are not about free market fluctuations, they are about inflationary monetary policy. Boom-bust cycles are generated by an act of embezzlement. Such cycles are about the diversion of wealth from true wealth-generators to the holders of the new-created and artificial money. In a free market economy, there are continuous changes and there is no stability as such, but that does not equate to the disruptions caused by monetary interventionism. Conclusion The key for the emergence of the boom-bust cycles are inflationary increases in the money supply. These increases set in motion an exchange of nothing for something (i.e., changes in price relations, the diversion of wealth, and distortions in the capital structure). The increase in the supply of gold is not the same. The increase in the supply of gold is an increase in the supply of wealth and production. This increase does not lead to the exchange of nothing for something. Contrary to non-wealth-generating and unsound activities, true wealth-generating activities can support themselves without inflationary expansion of money and credit to divert wealth to themselves. Artificial increases in the money supply, not increases in the gold supply, bring about the menace of the boom-bust cycle.

Trump Card Or Sisyphean Mission? – OpEd	As President Trump finalises his dream team to make the United States (US) great again, the most intriguing appointment is of Elon Musk and Vivek former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Despite its name, the department is not a government agency though it has been suggested that its main aim is to help business tycoons such as Musk dodge government regulations by leveraging their wealth to influence policy making. It is an advisory commission that, according to Trump, will ' work from outside government to offer the White House 'advice and guidance' and partner with the Office of Management and Budget to 'drive large-scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before'. DOGE Role Model for the World? DOGE is an undertaking which many countries in the world should be looking at closely not only for its impact in the US but also as a possible role model for their own governments. This applies to western allies of the US where disillusionment and distrust of government has become pronounced as evidenced by recent polls. It is also found in countries in the developing world where the rapid and unchecked growth of their bureaucracies - increasingly bloated, outdated, unaccountable and corrupt - has hindered rather than contributed to their socio-economic progress. Trump explained that the surprise move was to shock government systems and to 'pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies'. According to Musk, if DOGE succeeds, it can trim up to US$2 trillion from the current US federal budget of US$6.4 trillion whilst Ramaswamy has touted that it could reduce the number of federal employees by as much as 75%. Trump has also been vocal that it is to address 'massive waste and fraud' in government spending. Less prominent in pronouncements on DOGE is that it is to drain the swamp and to battle the deep state that Trump and supporters see as the main reason for his inability to implement the policy reforms of his first term. 'Either the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state,' the president-elect told supporters at his first rally of the 2024 election cycle. This is easier said than done. Not only have previous attempts at trimming back the federal bureaucracy failed - the most recent during Reagan’s presidency - it can be expected that key forces within Congress, the federal bureaucracy and deep state actors - will fight to kill off attempts at downsizing the bureaucracy as this threatens their influence and power. Why DOGE Will Fail The campaign to disparage and stymie DOGE has already begun in earnest with US mainstream media giants such as CNN and New York Times fully engaged in bad mouthing the proposed agency even before it has begun work. The most favoured line of attack for now is that the new agency is an attempt at revenge and retribution by Trump. Mainstream media voices are being joined by those from the American left concerned that DOGE may be a tool for big business. A recent report in Jacobin, a leading socialist print and social media outlet described DOGE as 'asinine and dystopian' and expressed the hope that its relationship with the Trump administration 'flames out spectacularly' ( There may be a number of other possible outcomes, apart from flaming out, arising from this unprecedented attempt at institutional reform The one with the highest possibility is that it will fade out - not spectacularly but probably with a whimper. Conceived as a advisory task force - a high powered think tank at best according to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the centre-right American Action Forum - it has no evidence of bipartisan support or budget to get its plans going, DOGE is dependent on the persuasive power of Musk and Ramaswamy. Both are entrepreneurs without political experience to bring to the congressional jungle where their business prowess will not count for much. Meanwhile, their promoter, Trump, will have bigger battles on his hands so this particular 'shock and awe' approach is likely to prove short-lived. A second is that while DOGE may bring about some closure of governmental agencies, the process of downsizing through encouraging early retirement and voluntary departure is much more difficult than in the private sector. There will be a thicket of legal and political challenges to overcome from progressive and conservative quarters that have constituents who are a part or supportive of the federal bureaucracy elite ensconced in Washington D.C. As for draining the swamp and fighting the deep state, these too appear a losing battle. More likely is that even if the current Democrat swamp is drained, it will be a partial drainage and will be refilled with supporters from Trump's own swamp looking out for their own rather than America’s interests and well being. The deep state with its support groups embedded in the FBI, CIA, Defence and Justice departments and the military industrial complex will be the hardest obstacle for DOGE to overcome. The warning shots have already been fired at Trump. Expect these to continue with Musk and Ramaswamy as the latest targets.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGMbX8_h92VyV	2024-11-25T16:10:21-08:00	
What The FDA Gets Wrong About Drug Ads – OpEd	There are only two countries in the world where drug manufacturers are allowed to advertise their products directly to consumers: the United States and New Zealand. Drug companies in the United States, for example, are spending $4 billion a year on TV ads alone. The typical TV drug ad these days usually touts the benefits of a drug—maybe with a lot of singing and dancing—and closes with a brief rapid-fire list of possible side effects, as parodied on Saturday Night Live. That’s about to change. After 15 years of studying the matter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is going to require the ads to show less about the benefits and more about the side effects and risks. A new bill in Congress would impose similar restrictions on social media platforms. Under a Trump administration, regulations could become even harsher. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (Donald Trump’s pick to head Health and Human Services) wants to ban drug ads completely. Kennedy claims that drug ads are such an important source of revenue for the networks that they influence what is allowed on the regular programming (e.g., avoiding criticism of Pharma). Here is what the regulators and would-be regulators are missing. Our most important health care problem is not that people are taking too many prescription drugs. They are taking too few. Why Drug Advertising Is Good The social value of drug advertising is that it alerts patients to the fact that there is a possible remedy for a chronic illness. The payoff is that the viewer might seek medical advice from a doctor and get a prescription, where appropriate. There is no social value in ads that list risks and negative side effects. The information will always be too clipped to be understandable, it won’t be remembered anyway, and it is useless unless a doctor finds that the patient is a candidate for the drug. The time to discuss side effects is when patients are under a doctor’s care. Studies show that we get our best return in medicine on drugs. Per dollar spent, the return on investing in drug therapy is much higher than what we are getting from investing in doctor care or hospital therapies. For example, Columbia University’s Frank Lichtenberg has estimated that three quarters of the increase in life expectancy that we’ve enjoyed in recent decades is the sole result of our adoption of modern drugs. Yet we are underinvesting in drugs, as reflected in undertreatment rates for chronic illness in this country. Take diabetes. Studies show that only 2.4% of people with prediabetes receive a prescription for metformin (the preferred treatment) within a year of their diagnosis. Even among obese patients, the figure is only 10.4%. Three years after an initial diagnosis, when the patient is even more susceptible to the disease, the treatment rate is still surprisingly low: 3.9% overall and only 14% for obese patients. Or consider hypertension. One out of every four patients with the problem is not being treated at all. And only half of adults with hypertension have their blood pressure under control. Almost as bad as not getting the prescription people need is not taking the drug once it is in hand. Both problems arise for similar reasons. Nearly half of all Americans suffer from at least one ongoing or chronic health condition, and nearly half of these are not adhering to a needed drug regime. There are an estimated 125,000 deaths per year in the United States due to medication nonadherence. Further, an estimated 33% to 69% of medication-related hospital admissions are due to poor adherence. The total cost estimates for medication nonadherence range from $100 billion to $300 billion every year, when both direct and indirect costs are included. Nonadherence and failure to get a prescription in the first place occur for a variety of reasons: lack of information, misinformation and unfounded fear—all of which can be combatted with more, not less, information. Current Rules Restrict Use of Valuable Drugs Not only are the new rules ill-advised, the ones in force right now are already causing considerable harm. That’s because a drug prescribed by doctors—no matter how useful and widespread the application—cannot be advertised, even to doctors themselves, unless the use has been FDA- approved. Once a drug has been approved for one use by the FDA, doctors may find that it has other uses—even though the effectiveness of these other uses has never been studied through an FDA-approved trial. These are called 'off label' uses. For example, one study found that approximately 80% of oncologists had prescribed medications off-label in treating cancer patients. Another study found that about half of chemotherapy drugs are administered for conditions not specified on their FDA-approved labels. For pediatric care, physicians order at least one off-label drug in 18.5% of office visits. The practice is most common in neonate cancer patients, with 83% of visits involving an off-label prescription. For the population as a whole, about 10% to 20% of all prescriptions are for off-label uses. It is hard to exaggerate how unreasonable FDA regulations are in this regard. Even if researchers publish research findings on the off-label use of a drug in the New England Journal of Medicine, a drug company is not allowed to share that article with doctors. If they do, the drug company’s decision makers could wind up in prison! When it comes to the potential of drugs to treat chronic conditions, more information is better than less. And this is especially true in an age when there is so much misinformation on the internet. We should let people learn about the positive benefits of drugs from TV ads and other venues. That will encourage them to seek a doctor’s counsel. The doctor’s office is the place where risks and side effects should be discussed.

Mozambique: Security Force Crackdown Kills, Injures Children, Say...	Mozambican security forces deployed to suppress nationwide post-election protests have killed at least 10 children and injured dozens more since October 24, 2024, Human Rights Watch said. Police have detained hundreds of children, in many cases for days, without notifying their families, in violation of international human rights law. The protests and ensuing government crackdown have led to severe disruptions of education throughout the country. 'The Mozambican security forces that have used force unlawfully against protesters and bystanders have also showed a shocking disregard for the lives of children,' said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. 'The authorities should immediately release all those held, including children, for exercising their rights to free expression and assembly.' Post-election tensions escalated on October 24 after supporters of the independent presidential candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, and the leading opposition party, Optimistic People for the Development of Mozambique (Partido Optimista pelo Desenvolvimento de Moçambique, Podemos), rejected the official declaration that the ruling party and its candidates were the winners of the October 9 election. Mondlane had claimed victory the day after the polls closed. The ensuing protests called for by the opposition began largely peacefully. However, government security forces used live ammunition, rubber bullets, and tear gas to disperse the crowds. Protesters responded by burning tires, blocking roads, and throwing rocks and other objects at the police. On October 29, Mondlane called for a weeklong nationwide shutdown, culminating in a major march in Maputo, the capital, on November 7. In response, Interior Minister Pascoal Ronda accused Mondlane of causing terror and urged people not to join the protests because it could 'end up degenerating into acts of vandalism and violence.' The deputy police chief, Fernando Tsucana, during a live television interview with the privately operated station STV on November 3, pledged to ensure security on the streets and urged parents to send their children back to school. Many schools had been closed because of the violence. A spokesman for the Education Ministry, Manuel Simbini, told Human Rights Watch that the government had instructed schools to make alternative provisions for almost 13,000 students who were unable to take their final exams across the country due to the violence. A 26-year-old woman said that her sister was among those parents who believed the authorities’ pledge of safety and sent her 13-year-old daughter to school on November 4, despite the reported violence in their neighborhood. 'The situation was already tense with many police officers around,' she said. 'But my niece had to go to school because the teacher had scheduled a written test for that day.' On her way back from school just before 11 a.m., the girl was caught in a crowd of people fleeing tear gas and gunfire by the security forces. One of the bullets hit her in the neck, and she instantly fell to the ground and died, two witnesses said. Human Rights Watch documented nine additional cases of children killed and at least 36 other children injured by gunfire during the protests. The mother of a 6-year-old boy in Maputo’s Chamanculo neighborhood said that on November 5 they were standing in line to buy bread around 10 a.m., when nine riot police officers arrived in a pickup truck. Without warning they fired teargas and live bullets to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside the bakery. She said: 'We tried to run away, but there was no place to go or hide, so a bullet hit my son in the stomach.' She added that police officers took him and other injured people to the nearby Chamanculo hospital for medical treatment. The media reported further violations of children’s rights by the security forces and some protesters, including vandalizing schools, burning classrooms, and endangering children’s lives. Footage shared on social media on November 4, which Human Rights Watch geolocated to have been recently recorded outside a school in Tete province, appears to show dozens of children in school uniform fleeing in panic, after security forces allegedly threw tear gas canisters into their school premises. Human Rights Watch also documented the arbitrary detention for several days of children whom the security forces allegedly arrested during protests without notifying their families. The Mozambican Bar Association reported on November 6 that it had secured the release of over 2,700 people detained throughout the country for participation in the post-election demonstrations. Feroza Zacarias, head of the bar association’s human rights section, said that a significant number of the detainees were children and adolescents. A 17-year-old girl was arrested on November 17 during a 'pots and pans' protestin the capital’s Jardim neighborhood. Her father said the family only learned about her whereabouts two days later from the bar association. He said that when police officers at the station demanded payment of 25,000 meticals (around US$392) for his daughter’s release, he refused to pay on a lawyer’s advice. His daughter was released on November 21, without charges, after the bar association intervened. Mozambican authorities have publicly criticized the involvement of children in the protests. The National Council of Defense said in a statement that it 'deplore[d] in the strongest terms the involvement of children and the veiled attempt to subvert the legitimately established democratic order.' The statement did not mention children’s right to protest and the need for accountability for abuses against children. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child both affirm children’s rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly. Under the convention, children found in conflict with the law should be detained 'only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.' 'Concerned governments should press Mozambican authorities to stop unnecessary and excessive use of force against child protesters and bystanders and urgently address the harm to children’s education,' Ngari said. 'Those found responsible should be held accountable.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGCsAGWefyARB	2024-11-25T15:57:44-08:00	
Divide And Conquer: Political Riptides Threaten To Overwhelm The ...	Once again we find ourselves approaching that time of year when, as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln proclaimed, we’re supposed to give thanks as a nation and as individuals for our safety and our freedoms. But how do you give thanks for freedoms that are constantly being eroded? How do you express gratitude for one’s safety when the perils posed by the American police state grow more treacherous by the day? How do you come together as a nation in thanksgiving when the powers-that-be continue to polarize and divide us into warring factions? You can see this struggle—to reconcile the hope for a better, freer, more just world with the soul-sucking reality of a world in which greed, meanness and war continue to triumph—in John Lennon’s two songs, 'Imagine' (which exhorted us to 'Imagine all the people livin’ life in peace') and 'Happy Xmas (War Is Over)' (which was part of a major anti-war campaign, which were released within months of each other in 1971. Lennon—a musical genius, anti-war activist, and a high-profile example of the lengths to which the Deep State will go to persecute those who dare to challenge its authority—made clear that the only way to achieve an end to hunger, violence, war, and tyranny is to want it badly enough and work towards it. All these years later, we still don’t seem to want those things badly enough. Peace remains out of reach. Activists and whistleblowers continue to be prosecuted for challenging the government’s authority. Militarism is on the rise, all the while the governmental war machine continues to wreak havoc on innocent lives. For those of us who joined with Lennon to imagine a world of peace, it’s getting harder to reconcile that dream with the reality of the American police state. Those who do dare to speak up about government corruption are labeled dissidents, troublemakers, terrorists, lunatics, or mentally ill and tagged for surveillance, censorship or involuntary detention. And then there are those who remain silent while the world falls apart. By doing nothing, the onlookers become as guilty as the perpetrator. It works the same whether you’re talking about kids watching bullies torment a fellow student on a playground, passersby watching someone dying on a sidewalk, or citizens remaining silent in the face of government atrocities. There’s a term for this phenomenon where people stand by, watch and do nothing—even when there is no risk to their safety—while some horrific act takes place: it’s called the bystander effect. Historically, this bystander syndrome in which people remain silent and disengaged—mere onlookers—in the face of abject horrors and injustice has resulted in whole populations being conditioned to tolerate unspoken cruelty toward their fellow human beings: the crucifixion and slaughter of innocents by the Romans, the torture of the Inquisition, the atrocities of the Nazis, the butchery of the Fascists, the bloodshed by the Communists, and the cold-blooded war machines run by the military industrial complex. Psychological researchers John Darley and Bibb Latane mounted a series of experiments to discover why people respond with apathy or indifference instead of intervening. According to Darley and Latane, there are two critical factors that contribute to this moral lassitude. First, there’s the problem of pluralistic ignorance in which individuals in a group look to others to determine how to respond. Second, there’s the problem of 'diffusion of responsibility,' which is compounded by pluralistic ignorance. Basically, this means that no one acts to intervene or help because each person is waiting for someone else to do so. Their findings underscore the fact that evil prevails when good people do nothing. We see it all the time: when people are vocal about politics but silent in the face of human suffering and injustice, tyranny triumphs. For instance, psychologist Philip Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment studied the impact of perceived power and authority on middleclass students who were assigned to act as prisoners and prison guards. The experiment revealed that power does indeed corrupt (the appointed guards became increasingly abusive), and those who were relegated to being prisoners acted increasingly 'submissive and depersonalized, taking the abuse and saying little in protest.' This is how imperial presidents preside over police states. So, what can we do? Be modern-day Good Samaritans and do your part to push back against the darkness. Recognize injustice. Don’t turn away from suffering. Refuse to remain silent. Take a stand. Speak up. Speak out. 'If you think there is even a possibility that someone needs help, act on it,' advises Zimbardo. 'You may save a life. You are the modern version of the Good Samaritan that makes the world a better place for all of us.' This is what Zimbardo refers to as 'the power of one.' All it takes is one person breaking away from the fold to change the dynamics of a situation. Here’s what I suggest: this holiday season, do yourselves a favor and turn off the talking heads, shut down the screen devices, tune out the politicians, take a deep breath, then do something to pay your blessings forward. Find something to be thankful for about the things and people in your community for which you might have the least tolerance or appreciation. Instead of just rattling off a list of things you’re thankful for that sound good, dig a little deeper and acknowledge the good in those you may have underappreciated or feared. When it comes time to giving thanks for your good fortune, put your gratitude into action: pay your blessings forward with deeds that spread a little kindness, lighten someone’s burden, and brighten some dark corner. Engage in acts of kindness. Smile more. Fight less. Build bridges. Refuse to let toxic politics define your relationships. Focus on the things that unite instead of that which divides. Do your part to push back against the meanness of our culture with conscious compassion and humanity. Moods are contagious, the good and the bad. They can be passed from person to person. So can the actions associated with those moods, the good and the bad. Acts of benevolence, no matter how inconsequential they might seem, can spark a movement. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, all it takes is one person to start a chain reaction. For instance, a few years ago in Florida, a family of six—four adults and two young boys—were swept out to sea by a powerful rip current in Panama City Beach. There was no lifeguard on duty. The police were standing by, waiting for a rescue boat. And the few people who had tried to help ended up stranded, as well. Those on shore grouped together and formed a human chain. What started with five volunteers grew to 15, then 80 people, some of whom couldn’t swim. One by one, they linked hands and stretched as far as their chain would go. The strongest of the volunteers swam out beyond the chain and began passing the stranded victims of the rip current down the chain. One by one, they rescued those in trouble and pulled each other in. There’s a moral here for what needs to happen in this country if we only can band together and prevail against the riptides that threaten to overwhelm us.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGD2wDmXW19XJ	2024-11-25T15:51:53-08:00	
The Hunter-Gatherer Guide To Keeping Society Equal – OpEd	There is a great deal of attention in modern societies to inequality and the social problems it causes. Often inequality is considered to be the unavoidable consequence of how society operates in many cultures, with large population numbers and competition for resources requiring a hierarchy of successful and less-successful individuals. While our globalized world may seem dominated by this kind of society, there remain groups around the world who even today live very differently, despite continual and sometimes inescapable pressure. Anthropologists, whose science is the study of humans, have been fascinated by the diversity of ways our species have found to exist, and never more so than when confronted with cultures whose ethos and way of being are radically different from the urban societies that dominate our world: where words are weapons that actually win; where showing off your skills will get you mocked, and where every aspect of life is carefully organized so that no one person should ever have any more power than anyone else. How do some people come to live in a group that has no one at the top, telling the rest what to do? Anthropologists call societies that do not have ranks egalitarian, which means that everyone in them is equal to everyone else. This is a form of social organization that is almost exclusively seen in groups of people who are not settled in one place, tied to one type of food or resource. Rather, they spend quite a lot of their time in small groups, moving around as suits their needs. These kinds of groups have been called hunter-gatherers, but a more accurate name might be foragers: they make their living by walking through their world and exploiting what comes to hand. More than a century of research into the groups who follow their food through the landscape, and do not tie themselves to one location or one crop, has built up a picture of societies that choose to organize themselves very differently from nation-states and kingdoms, and, most importantly, actively refuse to allow any sort of rank among themselves. For a long time, there was an assumption that egalitarian societies were egalitarian simply because they were... simple. Living in small groups and moving constantly, they just couldn't build up mountains of wealth to wield power over other people. And with very small numbers of people in a group—say no more than a few dozen—anthropologists theorized that it couldn't be that complicated to run a society, so you wouldn't need a chief or a king making big decisions. As archaeology has revealed the shape of our distant human past, it is clear that before about 15,000 years ago, every human on earth lived the same mobile lifestyle. Living with only what you can carry and constantly on the move would seem very taxing to the armchair academic of the previous century. The rather impolite implication then is that modern human societies who chose to live in these mobile, egalitarian societies, were simply the last vestiges of a primitive form of human social organization—people who hadn't 'evolved' civilization. It is actually quite remarkable that this idea that an equal society was an easy thing to maintain hung around for so long. One of the problems may have been that the groups who lived these mobile lifestyles were often in the process of being colonized and controlled when anthropologists arrived to study them, and so were in the middle of considerable social upheaval. But another problem may simply have been a failure of imagination. There was considerable shock when anthropologists like James Woodburn began to conduct fieldwork by actually learning the language of the group they were studying and going to observe and ask questions of the people themselves about how life worked in a small foraging group. His work with the Hadza people of what is now Tanzania set in motion a train of research that pointed out that life in a small group is anything but simple. Tempers flare, relationships break down, and when you depend on your group for survival, any social unrest could have fatal consequences. Groups from around the world who maintain an egalitarian ethos have shown that rather than being too simple to 'invent' rank, they are instead too complex to allow one person or group of people to simply take charge. Keeping everyone in a group on equal footing requires a huge amount of effort, and has to be constantly maintained. The Ju/'hoansi people of southern Africa reckon it is particularly important to 'cool young men's hearts'; to stop them being prideful and boastful if they display some special skill, everyone agrees it's very important to bring them back down to earth. A hunter is never allowed to distribute his own meat; instead, the distribution is done in public, with everyone watching. Among the Ju/'hoansi, the proper etiquette is to gently mock a successful hunter—for instance telling them the giraffe that they have killed and will be feeding several camps for days was actually a bit scrawny, perhaps. Mockery seems to be one of the most critical tools in the political inventory for groups that actively try to achieve equality. Jerome Lewis, an anthropologist who lived with the Mbendjele of Northern Congo for several years, tells how poor behavior is subtly (or not so subtly) corrected by women who act out whatever foolish or misguided thing someone has done. The improvisational theater always has an appreciative audience, and all of the group will laugh resoundingly at the person who has done something wrong. What might seem a recipe for social disaster in a group that must get along in order to survive is anything but; the mockery only ends when the person who is being made fun of eventually gives up and laughs along with the rest of the group. We can now see that in those groups that refuse to have ranks among themselves, there are many ways that equality can be actively maintained, but they are almost entirely social. Many groups have a policy similar to that of the Ju/'hoansi when it comes to sharing meat or indeed, anything else that is in the camp—that it would be the height of rudeness not to. Those who transgress against the rules of society may have to face their whole society laughing at them. Even when and where groups choose to move is determined partly by social concerns. If you live in a small group, it is very important to stay connected to friends and family who live somewhere else, in case, for instance, you decide you just can't stand who you are living with at the moment. It seems that the last human societies on earth to live the mobile lifestyles that our species maintained for hundreds of thousands of years do so largely as equals—but equals who must be very careful to stay that way.

A Reformist Program On Immigration (Or What Harris Might Have Sai...	The immigration issue has split and/or weakened both center and left parties and movements across many nations in recent years. Serious economic and social problems afflicting national working classes have been 'managed'—at least temporarily—by scapegoating immigrants as if they were responsible for those problems. Leaders on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating. In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be 'tough on immigrants' showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration. Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as 'protecting the nation against an immigrant 'invasion'' widely prevailed. Appeals to morality, multiculturalism, and compassion for the plight of most immigrants failed to dissuade many on the left from disengaging and moving politically rightward. The center or moderate left needs but lacks clear, strong support for immigrants that does not alienate portions of their traditional electoral base. 'Me-too' opposition to immigration, even if less harsh and hostile than that of the professional demagogues, will fail, as Kamala Harris's campaign discovered. Moreover, classic left reformism suggests a radically different program on immigration. It is derived from the reformist program (the 'Green New Deal') to address climate change when it faced a parallel problem with job-holders in polluting industries. A parallel reformist program to deal with immigration might be called an 'Inclusive New Deal.' In contrast, conservative, right-wing, and fascistic political forces have used extreme opposition to immigration to grow their ranks. Those forces boldly accuse immigrants of bringing crime, disease, downward pressure on wages, competition for jobs, and burdensome, costly demands on schools, hospitals, and other public services. Even in the United States, a country mostly composed of successive immigrant waves (who obliterated and replaced the indigenous people), many of those immigrants' descendants now hold anti-immigrant views. Despite massive evidence to the contrary, they rationalize those views by insisting that, unlike former immigrants, today's differ in being 'unwilling to work.' Rightists advance their radical 'solutions' such as sharply tightening immigration rules, refusing all further immigration, and deporting millions. Even where moral, ethical, and religious traditions call us to welcome immigrants, right-wingers have found that anti-immigration politics can work well. They attack center-leftists for seeking future votes by being pro-immigration or only weakly anti-immigration. In the United States, they attack the Democratic Party for not putting their American-born constituents first. Patriotism, as defined by such rightists, now entails a strict anti-immigrant position that displaces traditional religions' endorsement of the opposite. Immigrants forced to arrive as slaves, Black people in the United States, for example, fared differently: their integration was mostly slower and much more partial. Brown immigrants who arrived as other than slaves also suffered slower and partial integration. Anti-Black-and-Brown racism added further discrimination and life difficulties to the experience of those immigrants. Institutionalized racism denied opportunities for such immigrant communities to develop their members' levels of education, job skills, businesses, personal wealth, and social confidence. All immigrants suffer delays in their access to those qualities and capabilities, but the addition of racism worsens and lengthens those delays, including in U.S. society today. The difficulties usually endured by immigrants slow and skew the development of the economy they have entered. The occasional explosions of immigrants' resentments and bitterness at their treatment—and the usually very violent subsequent repressions—then add further damage to their host economies. Repeated efforts by those opposed to immigration have rarely succeeded in stopping it. The broad range of social forces—including the persistent effects of colonial and neo-colonial subjugation, uneven capitalist development, and climate change—that propel people to emigrate usually outweigh their concerns for their own economic, personal safety, and family interests. For employers, immigration can cheapen labor costs by expanding the supply of labor power (especially when the opposite is threatened by falling birthrates or when capital accumulation risks bidding up wages). Undocumented immigrants offer employers notoriously outrageous opportunities for super-exploitation. Hence, they often support it. An important social cost of immigration is the opportunity it has regularly presented to demagogic politicians. They have repeatedly scapegoated immigrants to deflect genuine mass discontent where it might otherwise threaten the domestic employer class. Is there unemployment? The demagogue suggests that jobs are being preferentially reserved for immigrants. Are public services inadequate? The demagogue suggests that immigrants are placing excessive demands on them and corrupt officials are directing them to immigrants to secure cheap labor or votes. Demagogues often insist—again despite evidence to the contrary—that immigrants commit more crimes and bring and spread more disease than the native-born. The campaigns of Donald Trump and many Republicans scapegoated immigrants. Many Democrats' campaigns likewise featured the scapegoating of immigrants. In contrast, the real, basic economic problems of the United States were not seriously addressed in the latest presidential election campaigns. One of those is the immense gap between haves and have-nots that has widened over the last 40 years. Another is the economic instability that has the economy oscillating between inflation and recessions. Still another is the obvious decline of the American empire (the relatively declining roles of U.S. exports, imports, investments, and the dollar) within the global economy. These issues were marginalized or, more often, ignored. Instead, candidates relentlessly scapegoated 12 million undocumented immigrants (among the poorest of the poor) as if they were the cause of and thus to blame for the deep problems of U.S. capitalism, an economy of 330 million people. Likewise, they excoriated China for the economic competition its economic growth has brought to the United States. Doing that conveniently deflects blame from the corporate employers who made the decision to move production from the United States to China. As usual, all social blame or criticism must be kept from touching the U.S. capitalist system that accounts for those profit-driven decisions. Deep, costly, and lasting consequences have followed the demagoguery and divisions in societies that split over immigration. Much energy, time, and money is diverted from dealing with the nation's real economic problems to obsessive 'coping with' immigration (homeland security budgets, border patrol budgets, and wall construction and maintenance). Still more is devoted to housing, policing, feeding, and otherwise 'processing' undocumented immigrants. If high-priority policy instead created good jobs with good incomes for immigrants, huge portions of these social costs would be unnecessary. Moreover, worthwhile alternatives to failed existing immigration policies are available if sufficient political power places them on the social and political agendas of societies confronting immigration. A remarkable flaw of today's global capitalism lies in its provocation of massive migration of people alongside its massive, costly failure to plan or manage that migration. One such alternative policy could solve together the recurring problems of unemployment, inadequate housing and social services, and immigration. In the U.S. case, another Marshall Plan or 'Inclusive' New Deal, green or otherwise, is needed. It could create jobs performing public services (paid at or above the current median for such jobs) that would be provided, as a right, to every unemployed citizen as priority #1. As priority #2, equivalent jobs would be provided, as a right, to all immigrants. As priority #3, the jobs thus created would include expanding the housing and all other social services needed to adequately accommodate the entire population, native plus immigrant. The tragic social divisiveness of immigrant-vs-native competition for jobs might thereby be sharply reduced. Such an Inclusive New Deal could be funded by (1) billions of dollars no longer needed for unemployment insurance, (2) increased income and other taxes paid by newly employed native and immigrant workers, (3) increased taxes paid by businesses profiting from increased spending by those workers, and (4) an annual wealth tax of 2 percent on all personal wealth above $20 million. Immigration could be reduced for the first five years of this Inclusive New Deal to get it fully established and running. A major side benefit of this Inclusive New Deal would be the huge boost in receipts for Social Security. Another such benefit would be the reduced demands placed on social services by the better physical and mental health of all newly employed workers. Finally, as a social dividend from such an Inclusive New Deal, the official work week in the United States for all workers could be reduced from 40 to 36 hours (with no pay reduction). Imagine the enormous social benefits that would accrue to the entire U.S. population, native and immigrant, from this different reformist approach to the immigration issue. In the United States and beyond, such an approach would reduce the social divisions over jobs, incomes, housing, homelessness, social services, and immigration. A strong, growing economy attracts immigrants, integrates them productively, and thereby impresses the world. A weak, declining economy not only fails to employ all its people productively but by deporting immigrants advertises its failure to the world. A radical program would embrace the freedom to migrate as universal and therefore reorient the global location of investment to serve that freedom both domestically and internationally.

Seoul Confirms Casualties Among North Korean Troops In Russia	By Taejun Kang South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, or NIS, said on Monday it had 'specific intelligence' that North Korean forces in Russia had suffered casualties but it did not comment on a media report that 500 North Koreans had been killed in a Ukrainian attack with British missiles. The U.S. and South Korea have said that North Korean troops had been fighting against Ukrainian forces in Kursk. The U.S. has estimated more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to Kursk and they had begun combat operations alongside Russian forces. Neither Russia nor North Korea have confirmed the presence of North Korean troops. Videos circulated by pro-Russian war bloggers indicated that up to 12 British Storm Shadow missiles struck a target believed to be a command headquarters in the village of Maryno on Wednesday. The site might have been used by North Korean and Russian officers, the defense news publisher Global Defense Corp reported. South Korea’s NIS, while confirming it had 'specific intelligence' to confirm North Korean casualties, did not provide any estimated casualty toll. It said it was closely monitoring the situation. Separately, The Wall Street Journal, citing Western officials, said the attack on the command headquarters also killed one high-level North Korean official. Ukraine’s military confirmed the use of the British missile, while Britain has not commented. Anti-air missiles, air defense equipment South Korea’s top security adviser said that in exchange for sending its troops to help Russia, North Korea had received anti-air missiles and other air defense equipment. 'Russia is believed to have provided equipment and anti-air missiles to strengthen Pyongyang’s vulnerable air defense system,' National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik said during an interview with the South Korean broadcaster SBS on Friday. 'Following North Korea’s failed military spy satellite launch on May 27, Russia had already declared its intention to support satellite-related technologies [to the North], and it reportedly supplied various military technologies,' Shin said. 'We believe that there has also been economic aid in various forms,' he added. When asked about the possibility of the Russia-Ukraine war expanding into a wider war, Shin said it was unlikely. 'Especially, it is very difficult for Russia to actually use nuclear weapons,' Shin said. On the possibility of North Korea sending additional troops to Russia, Shin said: 'We cannot completely rule that out, but we have no confirmed information at this stage.' 'Russia currently does not have the multiple rocket launcher system and it remains to be seen whether all or part of the operational troops will go, but if all the assigned personnel were to go, it would be around 4,000 people at most,' he explained. The NIS confirmed last week that North Korea had exported additional artillery ammunition and launchers to Russia, including 170-millimeter self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm multiple rocket launchers, which raised a speculation that Pyongyang might send an additional artillery unit to Russia. Russian warning Russia warned that it would respond strongly if South Korea supplies lethal weapons to Ukraine, saying it would 'fully destroy relations between the two countries.' 'Seoul must realize that the possible use of South Korean weapons to kill Russian citizens will fully destroy relations between our countries,' said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko in an interview with state news agency TASS on Sunday. 'Of course, we will respond in every way that we find necessary. It is unlikely that this will strengthen the security of the Republic of Korea itself.' The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s official name. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said in a press conference on Nov. 7 that while Seoul had provided humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine, the situation has changed with the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. 'If the North Korean military gains experience in modern warfare, it could become a critical problem for our security,' said Yoon. 'So we will now change the support method from the previous humanitarian nature to match the level of involvement of the North Korean military. We will not rule out weapons support to Ukraine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGCaFXCh3gpZL	2024-11-25T15:44:56-08:00	
Pakistan: Civilian Carnage – Analysis	By Ajit Kumar Singh On November 21, 2024, terrorists opened fire on a passenger convoy in the Kurram District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) killing at least 38 persons and injuring 11. At the time of writing, the death toll had risen to 43. The convoy of around 200 vehicles, carrying Shia passengers between Peshawar and Parachinar, came under heavy gunfire in the densely populated Bagan town. Kurram Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud disclosed that 'two separate convoys of members of the Shia community … were targeted by the terrorists in the Kurram district… both convoys consisted of around 40 vehicles travelling under police escort.' Soon after the terrorist attack, clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram. 'The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,' said an unnamed local administration official, adding, 'Among the deceased 16 were Sunni, while 66 belonged to the Shia community.' Meanwhile, the worst previous attack targeting civilians was recorded on September 29, 2023, when at least 55 persons were killed while another 100 were injured in a suicide blast targeting a 12th Rabiul Awwal procession near Madina Masjid at Alfalah Road in Mastung town (Mastung District), Balochistan. Mastung Assistant Commissioner Atta-ul-Munim had said that the explosion took place when people were gathering for the procession. The target were people of the Barelvi sub-sect of Sunni Muslims. Some of the other prominent attacks, each with 25 or more civilian fatalities, in Pakistan since the launch of the operation Zarb-e-Azb [Sword of the Prophet] on June 15, 2014, included: July 30, 2023: At least 54 people, including a Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) local leader, were killed and more than 100 sustained injuries in a suicide blast at the JUI-F workers' convention on Shanday Morr near the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) office in the Khar town of Bajaur District in KP. March 4, 2022: At least 57 worshippers lost their lives and 194 were injured when a suicide attacker detonated his explosives inside a Shia Mosque in the Koocha Risaldar area of Peshawar, the provincial capital of KP. Later, the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) claimed the suicide bombing. November 23, 2018: At least 33 people, including 22 Shias, were killed and more than 51 were injured in a suicide attack in the crowded marketplace near an Imambargah (Shia place of worship) in the Juma Bazar (Friday Market) of Kalaya town in the Lower Orakzai District of KP. July 13, 2018: A suicide bomber targeting a political rally of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) killed at least 128 people and injured over 200 in the Dringarh village of Mastung District. Both IS-KP and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP )'s 'Ghazi Force Lal Masjid' wing claimed responsibility for the attack. May 12, 2017: At least 27 people were killed and 40, including Senate Deputy Chairman Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Haideri's convoy in Mastung town, Mastung District, Balochistan. February 16, 2017: At least 76 people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked the crowded Sufi shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the Sehwan Sharif town of Sehwan District in Sindh, injuring up to another 250. The blast took place inside the premises of the shrine as a dhamaal (meditative dance) was taking place, with a large number of women and children among the casualties. Devotees throng the shrine of the revered Sufi saint every Thursday to participate in a dhamaal and prayers. The IS-KP claimed responsibility for the attack. September 16, 2016: A suicide bomber killed at least 28 people and wounded more than 45 while they attended Friday prayers at a mosque in the Pekhan Killay area of Anbar tehsil (revenue unit) in the then Mohmand Agency of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Jama'at-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a breakaway faction of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. August 8, 2016: At least 70 persons were killed and over 100 were wounded in a suicide bombing at the emergency ward of Quetta's Civil Hospital, where scores of people had gathered to mourn the death of Balochistan Bar Association (BBA) President Bilal Anwar Kasi in a gun attack earlier in the day. Law enforcement officials said that the two attacks were connected and the blast was carried out by a suicide bomber. Fifty-five of the 70 dead were lawyers, including BBA's former President Baz Muhammad Kakar, former Supreme Court Bar Association Vice-President Syed Qahir Shah, Advocate Sangat Jamaldani, son of Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) Secretary General Jahanzeb Jamaldani, and Advocate Dawood Lasi, son of Former Federal Minister Abdul Malik Kasi. March 27, 2016: At least 72 people were killed and more than 300 injured when a suicide bomber ripped through the parking space in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park situated near Allama Iqbal Town in Lahore, Punjab, while Christians were celebrating Easter. JuA claimed responsibility for the attack, with a spokesperson declaring, 'We claim responsibility for the attack on Christians as they were celebrating Easter.' December 29, 2015: At least 26 people were killed and 50 were injured as a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near a NADRA office located on the link road in the Mardan town of Mardan District in KP. The explosion ripped through the front entrance of the regional branch of NADRA. JuA claimed responsibility for the attack. December 13, 2015: At least 25 persons were killed and 62 injured when a device containing about 35 kilograms of explosives ripped through a makeshift market in Parachinar town of Kurram Agency in FATA. Officials disclosed that the device, kept in a sack, exploded when a large number of people were buying second-hand clothes. Two militant groups - Lashkar-e-Jhangvi Al-Alami (LeJ International) and Ansarul Mujahideen (based in South Waziristan Agency) - claimed responsibility for the attack, with one of them (LeJ) asserting that the target was the Shia community. May 13, 2015: At least 47 Ismaili Shias were killed and another 24 were injured when unidentified militants opened fire in the Safora Chowrangi area near Dow Medical College in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Town, Karachi, Sindh. January 30, 2015: At least 61 Shias were killed and 50 were injured in a bomb explosion at Karbala Maula Imambargah in the Lakhi Dar area of Shikarpur District, Sindh. Jundullah, a splinter group of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. Fahad Marwat, Jundullah 'spokesperson', declared, 'Our target was the Shia community… They are our enemies,'. December 16, 2014: At least 148 persons, including 132 children, nine school staff members and all seven suicide attackers, were killed when TTP militants stormed and opened fire at the Army Public School located on Warsak Road in the provincial capital, Peshawar. TTP claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that the attack was in retaliation to military operations in the North Waziristan and Khyber Agencies of FATA. November 2, 2014: At least 60 people, including children and women, were killed and more than 150 were injured when a suicide bomber detonated his suicide vest in a parking area, about 500 meters from the Wagah Border on the Pakistan side. Giving details about the incident, the then Inspector General Police (IGP) Punjab, Pakistan, Mushtaq Ahmad Sukhera, stated, 'A large number of people were returning after watching Rangers flag ceremony at Wagah border when a suicide bomber blew himself up near one of the exit gates.' Of these 17 incidents, nine were sectarian attacks. Since June 15, 2014, in 178 such incidents, at least 762 civilians have been killed, and another 979 have been injured. Such attacks have led to increased animosities between sectarian groups and led to several clashes. For instance, hours after the November 21, 2024, attack (above), deadly clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram which resulted in at least 39 deaths. The clashes continued till November 23 late night. Though 'both sides have agreed to a seven-day ceasefire, during which they will also exchange prisoners and return bodies to one another' as disclosed by Muhammad Ali Saif, spokesperson for the KP Government on November 24, given the fraught ties, particularly over the past few months, between the two sides, the ceasefire is unlikely to last longer. Notably, over 150 have been killed in such clashes in the region over the past five months. Meanwhile, overall civilian fatalities in terrorist violence have been on a continuous rise since 2020, after declining to 142 in 2019. Fatalities in this category increased to 169 in 2020, 215 in 2021, 229 in 2022 and 386 in 2023. At least 561 civilians have already been killed with over a month still left in 2024, the highest since 2015, when there were 866 such fatalities. Significantly, then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had had declared, in the National Assembly, on June 16, 2014, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb had been launched against terrorism and it would continue till its final objective of the restoration of peace and tranquillity in Pakistan had been obtained. 'I am confident the operation will be the harbinger of peace and security for Pakistan,' he asserted. As SAIR had noted then, 'Such vaunting declarations are not a novelty in Pakistan, but are difficult to reconcile with the country's broader strategic design and continuing exploitation of terrorism as an instrument, both of domestic political management and external strategic projection… In all probability, Operation Zarb-e-Azb will also come to an end sooner rather than later, without any decisive gains. The military may bring away the illusion that the terrorist assault at Karachi has been 'avenged', but the capacities and intentions of the terrorists are unlikely to be impacted in any significant measure.' Indeed, Operation Zarb-e-Azb has ended and so have other operations that followed , but terrorism continues to thrive in Pakistan. The hapless citizenry is unlikely to receive any respite in a situation where the Security Forces are themselves under increased threat, with over 636 SF personnel already killed in 2024, the highest in a year since 2013 (665).

India: Shadow From The Past In Punjab – Analysis	By Ruchika Kakkar On November 12, 2024, Shimla Singh, a terrorist associated with the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF), was arrested in the Mansa District of Punjab. Gaurav Yadav, Director General of Police (DGP), Punjab, disclosed that Shimla Singh confessed to his role in the grenade attack at the Jio Petrol Pump on Sirsa Road in Mansa District, in the intervening night of October 26-27, 2024. Shimla Singh revealed that he received the grenade from Garhshankar in the Hoshiarpur District of Punjab, on the instructions of KTF's current 'chief' Arshdeep Singh aka Arsh Dala. No casualty was reported in the incident. On November 10, 2024, DGP Yadav announced on X, the arrest of two key KTF terrorists - Anmol Preet Singh aka Vishal, and Navjot Singh aka Neetu - near Kharar in the Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar District of Punjab. The accused were involved in the murder of Gurpreet Singh Hari Nau in Faridkot, Punjab, on October 9, 2024. Investigations revealed their role in the killing of Jaswant Singh Gill on November 7, 2024, in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, under Arsh Dala's instructions. On October 24, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Baljeet Singh aka Baljeet Maur, an absconding KTF member, from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) in Delhi. Investigations revealed that he was involved in extortion, recruitment of new cadres, as well as terrorist funding to India-based associates. On May 2, 2024, Police arrested four KTF members for allegedly making an extortion demand of INR five million from a resident in the Muktsar District of Punjab. One .32-bore pistol, four cartridges, five cell phones, a scooter and a car, were seized from them. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since February 17, 2023, at least 15 KTF operatives/associates have been arrested across India (data till November 22, 2024), including 10 such arrests in 2024. In a press release dated February 17, 2023, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) declared KTF as a militant outfit, noting, 'It is a militant outfit and it aims to revive terrorism in Punjab. It challenges the territorial integrity, unity, national security and sovereignty of India and promotes various acts of terrorism, including targeted killings in Punjab.' KTF has collaborated with jihadist groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ), to plot attacks in Punjab. In 2014, KTF and LeT planned to airdrop militants into Pathankot using a German-imported glider, though the mission failed due to technical issues. KTF remains active in attempting bombings, armed attacks, and targeting VIPs in Punjab, often coordinating with Pakistan-based jihadi elements. Some of the recent killings (apart from the two mentioned above) in which the role of KTF-linked operatives is suspected included: September 18, 2023: Congress leader Baljinder Singh Balli (45), was killed in Moga, Punjab. Arsh Dala claimed responsibility for the attack through a Facebook post.January 31, 2021: Hindu Priest Kamaldeep Sharma was killed by Kamaljeet Sharma and Ram Singh aka Sonain, in Jalandhar District, Punjab, on the directions of Arsh Dala and the then KTF 'chief' Hardeep Singh Nijjar. November 20, 2020: A member of Dera Sacha Sauda, Manohar Lal Arora, was killed at Bhagta Bhai Ka village in the Bathinda District of Punjab. An NIA First Information Report dated February 13, 2024, inter alia, observed, 'KTF terror associates have conspired to smuggle arms and ammunition into India, raise funds for activities of KTF through extortion and carry out targeted killings to create terror in the minds of the people of Punjab. They are also involved in the recruitment of persons into KTF for carrying out their terrorist activities… The KTF operatives are working in close collaboration with the Bambiha criminal gang to use the network including resources and logistics of the gang for the commission of terrorist and criminal activities in India… ' The Bambiha criminal gang which used to operate in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan has recently started operating in Delhi. 'Founded' by Davinder Bambiha who was killed in an encounter with police in 2016, it is currently led by Gaurav aka Lucky Patial, who is either in the United States or Armenia. The NIA is investigating at least seven KTF-linked cases. It has filed charge sheets in all these seven cases, against 31 persons. The KTF was founded in 2011 by Jagtar Singh Tara, a former Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) militant involved in the assassination of the then Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh on August 31, 1995. After escaping from Chandigarh's Burail Jail in 2004, Jagtar Singh fled to Pakistan, and later moved to Thailand to establish a militant training base. He was arrested in Thailand in 2015 and deported to India, after which he revealed ISI's role in shifting Khalistani training operations to Thailand. Supported by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), KTF is one of four militant groups, including BKI, Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), and Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), that spearhead ISI-backed violence in Punjab. Based in Pakistan, KTF has supporters in a number of countries, prominently including Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Thailand and USA. It is financially supported by ISI and linked to other various Khalistani leaders, including Rattandeep Singh and Resham Singh. Nijjar, who joined KTF in 2013 and was radicalized by Tara, became the chief of KTF after Jagtar Singh Tara's re-arrest. Nijjar was allegedly groomed by the ISI, who gave him arms and explosives training in 2012 and 2013, and subsequently worked doe the revival of KTF. Nijjar was declared a designated terrorist through a UMHA notification dated July 1, 2022, which, inter alia, read, Hardeep Singh Nijjar is chief of Khalistan Tiger Force… and is actively involved in operationalizing, networking, training and financing Khalistan Tiger Force module members… Nijjar is accused in various cases registered and being investigated by the Punjab Police… the Central Government believes that Hardeep Singh Nijjar is involved in terrorism and Hardeep Singh Nijjar is to be notified as a terrorist… On June 18, 2023, (8.27pm local time), Canada-based Nijjar was shot dead by two unidentified youth outside the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, in the British Columbia Province of Canada. Nijjar's assassination has become a major point of contention between India and Canada. Arsh Dala succeeded Nijjar as the 'chief' od KTF. A UMHA notification of January 9, 2023, designated Dala a terrorist, observing Dala 'is associated with Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF)' and 'is very close to Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist and runs terror modules on behalf of him.' Arsh Dala is reported to have been arrested in Canada following a shooting incident in Milton Town, Ontario, on October 28, 2024. On October 29, the Halton Regional Police Service (HRPS) disclosed that it had arrested two men on charges of 'discharging firearm with intent', after the duo had come to a hospital and one of them was treated for a non-life-threatening gunshot wound and later discharged. Though It did not disclose their identity, both accused 'were held in custody pending a bail hearing.' It later emerged that the injured party was Dala. Meanwhile, India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, 'We have seen media reports circulating since 10 November on the arrest in Canada of proclaimed offender Arsh Singh Gill aka Arsh Dala, the de-facto chief of the Khalistan Tiger Force. Canadian print and visual media have widely reported on the arrest… In view of the recent arrest, our agencies will be following up on an extradition request. Given Arsh Dala's criminal record in India and his involvement in similar illegal activities in Canada, it is expected that he will be extradited or deported to face justice in India.' However, given the current status of Indo-Canadian ties, it is quite unlikely that Dala will be extradited at any time in the near future. Whatever may happen in the case of extradition, it is quite clear that the threat emerging out of Canadian soil in the form of Khalistani terrorism/extremism and its linkages to gangsterism, including the threats arising from KTF, have been growing in recent times. Given the fraught relations between New Delhi and Ottawa since the Nijjar allegations, significant counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries will remain unlikely. If diplomatic pressure is to be increased on Canada to act against the Khalistani gangster-terrorist networks, India will have to address their manifestation on its own soil, as well as the many deficits in enforcement, investigation and prosecution that impede international cooperation on these issues.

Spain’s Center-Right ‘Foolish’ To Think EPP Would Upset EU Allian...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- Spain's Partido Popular (PP) was foolish if it thought that European People's Party (EPP) leader Manfred Weber would break the grand coalition with the S&D and Liberals in the European Parliament in exchange for torpedoing future commissioner Teresa Ribera, Ignacio Molina, an expert on EU politics, told Euractiv.es. Molina is a senior researcher and EU policy expert at the Real Instituto Elcano, one of Spain's most prestigious think tanks. After a tense week in which the formation of the second European Commission, headed by Ursula von der Leyen, was up in the air because of the PP's veto on Ribera, the grand coalition of the EPP and the Socialist Group (S&D) with the Liberals has been saved, but at the cost of many wounds, Molina warned. 'If the PP really thought that they were capable of convincing the EPP to veto Ribera and thus break the grand coalition, they were really fooling themselves,' Molina told Euractiv.es. An agreement was finally announced last Wednesday between the EPP, S&D, and Renew Europe leaders, paving the way for the second von der Leyen team to be sworn in this week. Ribera will be the future commissioner for competition and vice president for a clean, fair, and competitive transition. 'It is likely that this week, the PP will abstain (in the vote on the new Commission). We will have to see to what extent they maintain their hard-line or accept the path of pragmatism which Weber has imposed by not wanting to break the grand coalition with the S&D group,' Molina stressed. According to the expert, although the PSOE and the PP have on many occasions coordinated their positions and voted together in the European Parliament, in the case of Ribera, the positions have become highly polarised, weakening this 'unity', which does not exist in Madrid, Molina recalled. No breaking of the status quo 'They (the PP) have taken political advantage of the floods (in Valencia and Castilla-La Mancha). But the attempt to erode Ribera came long before the catastrophe occurred. When (parliamentary) hearings were being prepared, the appearance of the new vice-presidents was left until the end because of rumours in Madrid that the PP was going to weaken her or even try to have her rejected,' Molina added. He recalled that 'since 1999, the European Parliament has always eliminated a commissioner candidate'. In 2014, the PSOE voted against former energy and climate action commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete (PP), who served in Brussels between 2014 and 2019. In the days before the 'white smoke' announcement for the new European Commission last Wednesday, the PP maintained a hard line. The party's spokesperson in Brussels, Dolors Montserrat, reaffirmed the formation's total rejection of Ribera. But despite the PP's now-dashed hopes, Molina believes that Weber never intended to break the alliance with the S&D and the Liberals. 'Weber wanted to please the PP, but he never wanted to destroy the grand coalition,' Molina said. 'Did anything justify Weber making things very difficult for Teresa Ribera? The answer is yes. But would he have gone so far as to break up the grand coalition? The answer is a clear no,' the expert added. In the same vein, the Elcano researcher recalled that despite a personal rivalry between von der Leyen and Weber, both from the CDU/CSU, one of the reasons that - in theory - could have partly justified Weber torpedoing Ribera, 'he cannot do whatever he wants'. Bleeding wounds in the wake of a fierce ideological battle Weber’s approach was: 'Let's listen to the PP by hindering the ‘anti-nuclear’ Ribera as much as possible, and maybe we can even get (Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro) Sánchez to change his candidate. That would be good for us' but, in reality, 'Weber was never willing to risk breaking the current status quo', Molina said. According to the expert, Weber never wanted to break the grand coalition because that would have meant 'falling into the hands of the far right (including the Patriots for Europe group). It was a very well-considered and rational decision on Weber's part.' However, although the PP did not topple Ribera, the future Spanish commissioner ‘has sweated blood this week. And that is not a bad thing for the EPP group,' Molina added. Moreover, according to the Elcano expert, the battle between the PSOE and the PP in Brussels 'will leave wounds' between the two parties, which until now have almost always voted as a united bloc on major issues affecting Spanish interests. The 'Ribera case' means that 'trust between PP and PSOE MEPs has been badly damaged, and this is a novelty because until now, the polarisation of Spanish political disputes has not usually been exported to Brussels.' 'With everything that has happened last week, things have changed and will leave scars on both parties,' Molina also warned.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGFL45X0am235	2024-11-25T15:38:08-08:00	
The Roadmap To A Just Peace In Palestine – OpEd	A major problem in American thinking relating to the Middle East is the utter rejection of the notion that Palestinian rights are fundamental, if even relevant at all, to the coveted peace and stability. In the years before the Trump administration’s so-called deal of the century was officially revealed on Jan. 28, 2020, successive US administrations had attempted to 'stabilize' the Middle East at the expense of the Palestinians. Earlier plans, or deals, rested on the premise of total marginalization of the Palestinian people and their cause. They included the Rogers Plan of 1969 and the Second Rogers Plan the following year, which culminated in the Camp David Accords of 1978. When all such plans failed to subdue the Palestinians, Israel and the US began investing in an alternative Palestinian leadership that would be compliant with Tel Aviv’s will, often in exchange for money and a minimal share of power. The outcome was the Oslo Accords of the mid-1990s, which initially segmented the Palestinians politically, yielding competing classes, but ultimately failed to defeat their quest for freedom. Numerous other initiatives and plans, mostly proposed by the US and other Western entities, tried to conclude the Palestinian struggle in favor of Israel without having to deal with the inconveniences of pressuring it to respect international law. They all failed. The 2020 deal was another failed attempt. It was centered on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s previously thwarted economic peace of 2009. For Israel, this new attempt was meant to be a win-win scenario: ending Israel’s regional isolation, amassing wealth, making the Israeli military occupation permanent and avoiding any accountability under international law, thus permanently defeating the Palestinians. The ongoing Israeli war and genocide in Gaza, the destabilization of the whole region and the ongoing Palestinian steadfastness and resistance are the final proof that there can never be real peace in the Middle East without justice for the Palestinians and other victims of Israeli brutality. No matter how many US-Western deals and initiatives are proposed in the future, this fact will not be altered. The same applies to those operating in a less official capacity but who are still committed to the same perusal of creative 'solutions' to the so-called conflict. Such notions may suggest that the lack of a solution reflects a lack of imagination and resolve or a dearth of legal texts that make a just end to the conflict impossible. However, a solution is readily available. Indeed, the solution to military occupation, apartheid and genocide is ending military occupation, dismantling the racist apartheid regime and holding Israeli war criminals accountable for their extermination of Palestinians. Not only do we have enough international and humanitarian laws and court orders to guide us through the process of holding Israel accountable, but also more than the needed critical mass of international consensus that should make this 'solution' possible. The main obstacle is the stubborn and unconditional US support of Israel, which has allowed the latter to flout international law and consensus for decades. International law regarding Palestine is not an outdated solution but a robust and growing legal discourse that refuses to entertain any Israeli or US interpretation of the war crimes, including the crime of genocide, underway in Gaza and the rest of the Occupied Territories. In February, the International Court of Justice held hearings that allowed representatives of more than 50 countries to articulate their political, legal and moral stances on the Israeli occupation of Palestine. While the acting legal adviser at the US State Department arguedthat the 15-judge panel at The Hague should not call for Israel’s withdrawal from the West Bank, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s legal adviser contended that the Palestinians’ 'use of force to resist oppression is an inalienable right.' In July, the court issued a landmark ruling that the Israeli occupation in all of its expressions is illegal under international law and that such illegality includes Israel’s occupation of East Jerusalem and all of its Jewish-only settlements, annexation attempts, theft of natural resources and so on. In September, international consensus was achieved again, as the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Israel end 'its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' within 12 months. This is a mere footnote in the massive body of international law regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Yet more is regularly being added to the already clear discourse, including last week’s issuing of arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court for top Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu. With such clarity in mind, why then should Palestinians, Arabs and the international community entertain or engage in any new deals, plans or solutions that operate outside the realms of international law and standards? The issue is obviously not the lack of a roadmap to a just peace, but the lack of interest or will to implement it, specifically on the part of the US and a few of its Western allies. It is their relentless backing of Israel and financing of its war machine that makes a just solution in Palestine unattainable, at least for now. As far as Palestinians are concerned, there can only be one acceptable deal: one that is predicated on the full implementation of international law, including the Palestinian people’s right of return and right to self-determination. The continued US-Israeli attempts to circumvent this fact will never impede Palestinians from carrying on with their struggle for freedom.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGGogoS9DTmbc	2024-11-25T15:35:23-08:00	
Philippine President’s Office: VP Duterte Could Be Prosecuted For...	By Jason Gutierrez The feud between Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice-President Sara Duterte has taken an astonishing turn with Marcos vowing to 'fight back' after his No. 2 openly warned that he would be assassinated should she be targeted and killed. Duterte’s public threats made over the weekend were being investigated, and if the evidence warranted it, she could be prosecuted, the Presidential Communications Office said, citing the Philippine justice department. President Marcos did not name his vice-president in a video conveying his response to her threats, but he termed as 'reckless' what he said were threatening statements that endangered the Philippines’ leadership. 'The statements we heard in the previous days were troubling. There is the reckless use of profanities and threats to kill some of us,' Marcos said in his video message on Monday. 'I will fight back,' he said, adding that 'such criminal' statements must not be ignored. 'If it’s that easy to plan the assassination of a president, how much [easier to plan against] ordinary citizens,' Marcos said. The Marcos and Duterte families had joined hands in an alliance to win the general election two years ago, but the partnership ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the government to allow an international investigation into the drug war waged by Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, Sara’s father. Duterte on Saturday said in an online press briefing that she had hired 'someone' to eliminate Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta and House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, in the event that she might be assassinated. 'No joke,' Sara Duterte said. Vice President Duterte later tried to walk back her remarks, saying they were hypothetical. In a statement Monday, she said that her remarks had been 'maliciously taken out of logical context.' The vice-president’s threats came after Zuleika Lopez, her chief of staff, was detained for contempt by the House. The House good government committee said it had found that Lopez was trying to hamper an inquiry into the vice-president’s alleged misuse of 125 million pesos (U.S. $2.12 million) from her budget as the VP and former education secretary. On Saturday, the Presidential Security Command issued a statement saying it had 'heightened and strengthened its security protocols.' 'Any threat to the life of the president and the first Family, regardless of its origin – and especially one made so brazenly in public – is treated with the utmost seriousness,' the statement said. 'We consider this a matter of national security and shall take all necessary measures to ensure the president’s safety.' ‘Not a normal statement’ On Monday, House Speaker Romualdez described the threats made by the vice-president as 'both alarming and unprecedented.' 'Let me be clear. This is no longer a joke. This is not a normal statement,' he said in a speech. 'This is a threat to our democracy, to our government, and the security of our nation.' Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), said it would subpoena Vice President Duterte as part of an investigation into her remarks at the press conference where she made the threats against Marcos. The NBI is the investigating arm of the justice department. The Vice President would be asked 'to appear within five days from today' to explain her remarks, NBI Director Jaime Santiago said. Were Duterte to ignore the subpoena, the bureau would commence its investigation using any legal evidence it had, Santiago said. 'Any and all threats against the life of the president shall be validated and considered a matter of national security,' National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said in a statement on Sunday. 'We underscore that the safety of the President is a non-partisan issue.'

Horn Of Africa Forum Opens In Djibouti Amid Ethiopia-Somalia Tens...	By Mohamed Olad Hassan Somali scholars, politicians and traditional leaders from across the Horn of Africa gathered in Djibouti on Monday for a three-day forum on strengthening regional stability. The annual forum, the eighth of its kind, was organized by the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies in Somalia, an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Mogadishu. Mursal Saney, executive director of the institute, said the forum is providing an opportunity for Somalis from across the region to discuss issues of concern. 'We have invited nearly 300 delegates including regional experts to provide them an opportunity to discuss and exhibit constructive ideas on how the Horn of Africa region can strengthen its stability and the importance of rule of law,' Saney said. This year’s forum comes at a time of growing tension between Somalia and Ethiopia over a port deal Addis Ababa signed in January with Somaliland, a breakaway region. Mogadishu sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia. The deal so far, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, gives landlocked Ethiopia a 50-year lease for a Red Sea port from Somaliland in exchange for possible recognition of Somaliland’s independence. The deal has angered Mogadishu, which has described it as an assault on Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ethiopia maintains that it does not infringe on Somalia's sovereignty. Somaliland declared its independence from the rest of Somalia in 1991, following the collapse of the military government led by late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Somalia has never accepted Somaliland’s secession, nor has Somaliland received international recognition. In July and August, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal. The issue has raised fears of fresh conflict in the Horn of Africa region. 'Because of its strategic location in the region and the fact that it is coming out of a conflict era, Somalia is thirsty for peace and regional stability, respecting the international law and the rule of law,' Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi said at the start of the forum. Also on Monday, Mumin Hassan Barre, Djibouti’s minister of justice and religion, said experts attending the forum should contribute to the well-being of the region. 'We see experts that know the region well, and I think the peace, stability and the solution of the region’s problems lie in the hands of its people, including the experts who gathered here,' Barre said. Somalis representing Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia are attending the event, as well as those from across the region and the diaspora communities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Mohamed Sheikh Nor contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGMQUuQCeZiyG	2024-11-25T15:31:09-08:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Intensify In Lebanon Amid Rumors Of Imminent C...	By Najia Houssari Israeli attacks on targets in Lebanon intensified on Monday, as rumors circulated in Tel Aviv and Beirut about the possibility of a ceasefire agreement within two days. US envoy Amos Hochstein has been leading complex negotiations between Israeli and Lebanese authorities with the aim of ending the conflict, which began on Sep. 23 with Israeli airstrikes, followed by ground incursions into border areas on Oct. 1. Since then, Israel has assassinated senior Hezbollah leaders, and the confirmed death toll from the fighting stands at about 3,800. This figure does not include Hezbollah members killed on the battlefield, the numbers of which are difficult to ascertain because of intense shelling in southern areas. The escalating war has also resulted in the destruction of thousands of residential and commercial buildings in areas stretching from the south of the country to the southern suburbs of Beirut and northern Bekaa. Tensions continue to run high as the population lives in fear of the intense airstrikes, with ambulances and fire trucks remaining on standby in all regions. MP Elias Bou Saab, the deputy speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, said: 'We are optimistic about a ceasefire and there is hope. But nothing can be confirmed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. What might put pressure on him is the battlefield.' Israeli aggression intensifies whenever peace negotiations move closer to an agreement, he added, in an attempt to put pressure on Lebanese authorities. 'We insist on our position regarding the inclusion of France in the committee overseeing the ceasefire implementation,' said Bou Saab. 'We did not hear anything about Israel’s freedom of movement in Lebanon, and we still speak only about UN Resolution 1701, with no additions and with an implementation mechanism.' Resolution 1701 was adopted by the Security Council in 2006 with the aim of resolving the conflict that year between Israel and Hezbollah. It calls for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, the withdrawal of Hezbollah and other forces from parts of the country south of the Litani River, and the disarmament of Hezbollah and other armed groups. News channel CNN quoted a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister as saying talks were moving toward a ceasefire. Another regional source told the network: 'The agreement is closer than ever. However, it has not been fully finalized yet.' Israel’s ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, said an agreement 'could happen in a few days' but 'there are still some sticking points that need to be resolved.' The Israeli Broadcasting Authority quoted the country’s education minister as saying that Hochstein has the green light to proceed with an agreement. It added that a deal with Lebanon had been finalized and Netanyahu was considering 'how to explain it to the public.' Also on Monday, diplomat Dan Shapiro from the US Department of Defense held meetings with senior Israeli officials that focused on the members of a proposed committee to monitor the ceasefire, most notably the participation of France, and the details of a monitoring mechanism to be led by the US. One report suggested Washington had agreed to provide Israel with a guarantee it would support any military action in response to threats from Lebanon and to disrupt any Hezbollah presence along the border. According to news website Axios, the draft agreement for a ceasefire includes a 60-day transitional period during which the Israeli army would withdraw from southern Lebanon, to be replaced by the Lebanese army in areas close to the border, and Hezbollah would move its heavy weapons from the border region to areas north of the Litani Line. Against this backdrop of peace negotiations, the continual Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut intensified on Monday, following 10 strikes the previous evening. The attacks targeted Haret Hreik, Hadath, Ghobeiry, Bir Al-Abed and Sfeir. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and as Arab News visited targeted areas, residents said 'there have never been any Hezbollah offices in these structures, neither now nor in the past, and the buildings are mainly for residential purposes.' A lawyer called Imad said the apartment building in the Hadath area in which he lived collapsed when it was hit by an airstrike. 'It is unbelievable that they use Hezbollah as a pretext to destroy our homes, which we purchased through financial loans to provide shelter for our families. They intend to annihilate us all,' he said. The Israeli army said on Monday that an airstrike that hit the Basta area of central Beirut early on Saturday had 'targeted a command center affiliated with Hezbollah.' Efforts to help the injured and recover the bodies of the dead continued at the scene of the attack until Sunday evening. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 29 people were killed and 67 wounded. The Israeli army also carried out numerous airstrikes in southern Lebanon, mainly targeting the cities of Tyre and Nabatieh. Ten people were killed, including a woman and a member of the Lebanese army, and 17 injured in three airstrikes on Tyre. Also in Tyre, an Israeli drone killed a motorcycle rider in a parking lot near the Central Bank of Lebanon. And three civilians were killed by an airstrike in the town of Ghazieh, south of Sidon. From the southern border to the northern banks of the Litani River, no area has been spared from Israeli airstrikes, which have extended as far north as the city of Baalbek, and the town of Hermel close to the border with Syria. In the east, back-and-forth operations between the Israeli army and Hezbollah continued as the former attempted to gain control over the town of Khiam. Its forces advanced, supported by Merkava tanks, from the southern outskirts under the cover of airstrikes and artillery bombardment, moving into the center of the town and toward Ebel Al-Saqi and Jdidet Marjeyoun. The Israeli army also deployed tanks between olive groves in the town of Deir Mimas after an incursion into the town last week. It began advancing toward the Tal Nahas-Kfar Kila-Qlayaa triangle. Elsewhere, Hezbollah and Israeli forces clashed in the western sector of the Maroun Al-Ras-Ainata-Bint Jbeil triangle. Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli army positions on the outskirts of the towns of Shamaa and Biyada. Israeli forces carried out house-demolition operations in Shamaa. Hezbollah also continued to launch attacks against northern Israel. The group said its rockets 'reached the Shraga base, north of the city of Acre, and targeted an Israeli army gathering in the settlement of Meron.' Israeli medical services said one person was injured in Nahariya by falling fragments from a rocket.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfWyhuM1h-VGPdHMO9eLl5Q	2024-11-25T15:28:49-08:00	
Persecution Of The Press Is The New Normal In Bongbong’s Philippi...	By Danilo Araña Arao The Philippines is one of the most dangerous places to practice journalism not just in Asia, but in the entire world. Members of the media are often smeared as communists, arbitrarily detained or murdered for doing their jobs. Worse, this behaviour is normalised by large swathes of society despite a constitutional right to a free press. Close to 200 journalists have been killed in the line of duty since the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr was ousted in 1986 — four of them under the current administration of his son Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio has been detained since 2020 on trumped-up charges of illegal possession of firearms and financing terrorist activities. Toward the end of former president Rodrigo Duterte’s term, the government blocked over two dozen websites, including the publications Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly over alleged links to terrorism. During Duterte’s term from 2016 to 2022, the major broadcaster ABS-CBN was shut down and popular online news site Rappler faced several legal cases, including tax evasion charges and registration cancellation that threatened its business operations. Duterte also banned a Rappler journalist from entering the Malacanan presidential palace. The former president’s penchant for sexist comments and sexual assault encouraged others to behave this way toward female journalists. The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict established in 2018did not spare journalists, media workers and news media organisations from claims that Filipinos in these industries were part of a communist conspiracy, a practice known in the Philippines as ‘red-tagging’. The entire AlterMidya organisation, a network of alternative news media organisations known for grassroots reporting and critical analysis, has been repeatedly red-tagged and many of its members face regular harassment and intimidation. This situation has not changed under Marcos Jr. Journalist Percy Lapid was killed near his house after being accused of being a communist. Dozens of websites remain blocked, and Frenchie Mae Cumpio continues to languish in jail even as the call for her release has gone international. A culture of impunity remains entrenched in the Philippine press as the rich and powerful circumvent the law. Unsolved killings of journalists have resulted in the Philippines being perennially listed in the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Global Impunity Index for 16 consecutive years. Reporters Without Borders puts the Philippines at 134 out of 180 countries in its 2024 World Press Freedom Index and stresses that although the Marcos Jr administration may be ‘amiable’ toward the press, the ongoing media attacks are ‘still worrisome’. For its part, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines has criticised Marcos Jr for his failure to protect and uphold press freedom. While the current administration claims to be transparent, Marcos Jr is largely inaccessible to the media and rarely entertains media queries. His actions suggest he does not place much value in freedom of information, given the lack of access offered to the president. Amnesty International has observed no progress in human rights under the Marcos Jr regime, nor have United Nations human rights officials. Such perceptions in the international sphere further amplify the impunity that affects Philippine society in general and the media in particular. The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said that there is little difference between Duterte and Marcos Jr in regard to human rights violations. Human rights group Karapatan documented 89 victims of extra-judicial killings and 13 cases of enforced disappearances from July 2022 to December 2023, among other empirical data painting a bleak picture. It does not help that Marcos Jr engages in disinformation, particularly historical denialism. He shows no remorse for what happened during his father’s dictatorship or denies the worst of it even existed. While there are news media organisations that are standing up to the current president, the Philippine news media have become mostly docile and compliant. The chilling effect is clear. Members of the media understand that if they push too hard they will wind up abused, imprisoned or even killed. Most in the industry want to avoid being the next victim. Certain media owners are either related to the Marcoses or are capitalists with diverse business interests, preferring to be on the good side of the government. They have for all intents and purposes become enablers of the regime’s media repression campaign. The Philippines must reject the normalisation of media repression. For those still fighting, the goal now is defending the constitutional right to press freedom and ending Marcos Jr’s culture of impunity.

New Strategic Synergy Between Vietnam And Malaysia – Analysis	The official visit by His Excellency To Lam, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to Malaysia creates a new chapter of Hanoi-Kuala Lumpur ties that has been rooted in historical friendship and strategic interdependence. This is Lam's first visit to Malaysia since being elected as head of the Communist Party of Vietnam in August this year, and the significance of the visit is further bolstered considering that the last time Malaysia received a visit from the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam was in March 1994, a year before Vietnam's formal accession to ASEAN. The General Secretary outlined the key pillars of this new partnership, which include strengthening political trust and cooperation, particularly in defence and security, and this heralds a new chapter in strengthening political trust, and deepening synergy and partnership in areas of high politics. As Lam emphasised the need for strategic collaboration in upholding international law and contributing to regional peace, development, and prosperity, this mutual commitment elevates the combined strength and advantage in working closely together in facing common challenges in the future. The elevation to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership underscores the role of various critical sectors that benefit both nations, including green and digital economy, science and technology, new energy transition, high technology advancement,human resources development and people to people relations. Vietnam's support for Malaysia's role and upcoming role as the Asean Chair will see greater cohesion and support for promoting regional peace and stability while upholding the sanctity of international law and the rules-based order. Bilateral ties have been underpinned by the common strength and prospect of economic interdependence, especially on critical resources and technologies. Both are looking to bolster resilience and reliability in supply chain, food security, defence assurances and critical technologies of the future including semiconductor and Artificial Intelligence. It is a testament to the enduring friendship between our nations and reflects the shared commitment we hold in advancing greater partnerships for global prosperity. In the focus on developing human capital and people to people advancement, Lam spoke about the broader regional context, where education and training are essential drivers and foundations that enable ASEAN and its member states to thrive in an unpredictable world. Higher economic and trade ties will bring long lasting returns to both nations, as both face common geopolitical and global economic risks. Vietnam is emerging as one of the fastest growing economic power with the highest prospect in the world, and this will complement Malaysia's existing economic transition efforts. By capitalising on one another's strength and advantage, both will create a solid bedrock of economic and political stability not only for ASEAN but for the greater inter-regional development as emerging middle powers. As both share a similar foreign policy approach of non-alignment, peaceful advocacy for conflict management, and non use of force, both Hanoi and Kuala Lumpur are poised to reap greater regional and global expansion of economic and diplomatic roles and influence. Vietnam is committed to proactive, comprehensive, and extensive international integration, while simultaneously enhancing Vietnam's contributions and responsibilities in world politics, the global economy, and the advancement of human civilization.Both nations prioritize trade, international cooperation, and the advancement of investment and technology. Great Economic and Geopolitical Prospect of Vietnam Vietnam has exponentially expanded its economic credentials and leadership in the region since joining ASEAN, being at the forefront of the regional supply chain. and market and among the biggest upcoming economic players in the worldWith ongoing economic reforms and its advantageous location within the Southeast Asia region along with its advantageous demographic asset in its youthful population, Vietnam is poised for a global economic power. This is complemented by its enabling foreign policy of smart diplomatic outreach and advocacy for peace and stability. Maintaining a balance in diplomacy and forming strategic alliances will help solidify Vietnam's position as a stabilizing force in Southeast Asia and beyond, and as a power balancer in the increasing power rivalry, with a stabilising impact on the region and complement Malaysia's efforts. Vietnam has had growth over the last ten years with an average annual GDP increase of 6 to 7%. In 2023, Vietnam's GDP soared to $411 billion from $280 billion in 2018 – a rise that showcases its economic stability and progress. Vietnam is expected to see its economy grow significantly by 2034 with a GDP exceeding $700 billion and a GDP per capita surpassing $10 000 as it moves towards becoming a middle income nation. By the year 2030, it is estimated that Vietnam will see a rise in its middle class population to around 45 million individuals; this growth is expected to boost spending and increase the demand for premium products and services in the country. Vietnam's digital economy is projected to reach $57 billion by 2025 from $23 billion recorded back in 2022 due to the expansion of e-commerce platforms and IT services, alongside the rise of the fintech industry. Vietnam has also quickly become a major export production hub for global manufacturers like South Korea's LG and Samsung Electronics, suppliers to Apple, Inc. and auto makers like Honda and Toyota. The government of Vietnam has pledged to allocate $117 billion, towards infrastructure initiatives from 2024, to 2030 focusing on advancements and projects, and expanding ports such as Hai Phong and Cai Mep Thie Vai to facilitate commerce. Vietnam is at the forefront of the shift towards renewable energy in Southeast Asia.Renewable energy accounted for 13.7% of Vietnam's electricity generation in 2023. It plans to boost its wind and solar power capacity to 45 gigawatts by 2030. Vietnam's young, tech-savvy population is driving innovation. The country's workforce has a median age of 32.5 years and high literacy rates, fostering innovation in startups and technology. The prospects for the coming decade are solid, driven by strong economic fundamentals, strategic geopolitical positioning, and pragmatic foreign policy. Both countries have similar strategic economic positioning and power roles in uplifting the voice and role of ASEAN and beyond. By capitalizing on Vietnam's strengths and elevating strategic partnerships, Malaysia can serve as a strategic partner in reaping joint benefits to be on track to emerge as a joint economic powerhouse and a stabilizing force in regional and global geopolitics. The visit by Lam will prove to be a historic chapter for both nations in presenting a more united front amidst escalating challenges in the region, and to synergise new areas of critical partnerships in key sectors, especially in defence and security and economic and trade realm, further uplifting the trajectories for high-income nation status for both nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFyldmmbkFqPY	2024-11-24T16:05:08-08:00	
India-China Border Agreement: A Case For Military Buildup – Analy...	By Kartik Bommakanti With India and China reaching a limited agreement on the disengagement from and patrolling of the Depsang Bulge and Demchok areas in eastern Ladakh, there is widespread jubilation in some quarters. The celebration of this breakthrough announced on 21 October 2024, should be tempered by the reality that there is still a significant amount of disengagement, de-escalation, and de-induction of forces to be completed by New Delhi and Beijing. Pending further negotiations, under the latest agreement, the following friction points were left out—Galwan Valley (PP 14), Pangong Tso (North and South Banks), Gogra (PP 17A) and Hotsprings (PP 15). These four areas are currently under buffer zones that prohibit patrolling, meaning the status quo ante, has not been restored completely. Meanwhile, with Depsang and Demchok, India and China have agreed to 'coordinated patrolling,' which one analyst described as an 'innovation.' This is misleading and deceptive because it is not an innovation, but a restriction on patrolling. There are three patrolling restrictions under the latest agreement. Firstly, each patrol team cannot exceed 14 troops. Secondly, the other side must be notified before embarking on a patrol. Thirdly, the number of patrols that Indian and Chinese forces can conduct cannot exceed two or three every month, to all the points they deem part of their territory in Depsang and Demchok. Indeed, though India can patrol areas in Demchok, it is not permitted to patrol Charding La—a key pass. In addition, there is a quid pro quo. Just as India has gained patrolling access to Demchok and Depsang up to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13, which it last secured access to in January 2020, China has gained a reciprocal concession by way of an 'escorted patrol' in the Yangste area of Arunachal Pradesh, as well as another location. These patrolling restrictions did not apply under the terms of the 1993 and 1996 agreements. Further, these 'innovations' are ultimately a concession to the Chinese because most of the territory that the Chinese occupied in April-May 2020 was primarily India-dominated, if not India-controlled, territory. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) maintains that '…verification patrolling has commenced on mutually agreed terms in Demchok and Depsang.' Nevertheless, restrictive conditions have been built into this agreement, in a quest to avoid clashes between Chinese and Indian forces. Only time will tell whether this arrangement will deliver the stabilising impact that the Modi government claims it is intended to achieve. Theoretically, clashes could still occur even under the new patrolling arrangement. Beijing has numerous opportunities to rake up trouble along the entire stretch of the 3,500 kilometres of contested boundary between India and China. India has had to accept these restrictive conditions as the price for resuming a limited patrolling agreement at Demchok and the Depsang Plains. The Chinese have compelled India to accept a shift in the terms of prior patrolling arrangements, and India’s consent implies a tacit acceptance of China’s case that earlier patrolling arrangements—as a result of agreements in 1993, 1996, 2005, and 2012—were unworkable or ineffective. Where does that leave India’s quest to restore the status ante of April 2020? Despite the Modi government’s impressive infrastructure build-up along the Sino-Indian boundary, which was one of the key reasons for the Chinese precipitating the ongoing boundary crisis, has New Delhi conceded to Beijing’s demands that it will limit further infrastructure development, especially the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) road? The government will have to come clean and clarify these matters. To its credit, the Modi government has invested heavily in border infrastructure and introduced vital changes in the military command structure. Under the interim budget in February 2024, the government has allocated more capital to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to beef up infrastructure in critical parts along the Sino-Indian border, such as the Nyoma Airfield in Ladakh, Shinku La Tunnel in Himachal Pradesh, the Nechiphu Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh and several others. Supplementing this infrastructure build-up, visible change is underway in the Indian Army’s conversion of its Headquarters Uttar Bharat (HQ-UB) into a new comprehensively operational Corp. This change is geared toward shifting the focus from the peacetime duties of the HQ-UB, which is now a Corps, to a Line of Actual Control (LaC) in the Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand sectors. These are very indispensable and laudable measures. Although the government is performing commendably on these two metrics, it is insufficient. Although the Modi government’s work on India’s border infrastructure paved the way for India’s military mobilisation against China’s annexation of Indian territory in April-May 2020, it has to do more to accumulate military strength through additional capital expenditure. Since 2017, well before the eruption of the current boundary crisis between India and China, there has not been significant growth in the defence budget, especially in capital acquisitions. Growth has been primarily in revenue expenditure which covers pensions, allowances, salaries and so on. This high growth of revenue spending is also driven by 'One Rank, One Pension' (OROP). Even with the introduction of the Agnipath recruitment scheme, cost savings that are intended to help pay for capital acquisitions in the armed services, will not reap benefits until many years later. Engagement with Beijing without militarily equipping the Indian armed forces with additional capabilities conveys weakness. It will run the risk of inviting more crises and possibly a serious military conflagration with the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

Liberty Squandered: The English Tradition From Magna Carta To Emp...	By Vibhu Vikramaditya The identity of a people often shapes the nature and trajectory of their government. In England, a deep-rooted belief in individual liberty has profoundly influenced the nation’s legal and cultural institutions, shaping English society from the early Middle Ages through the Industrial Revolution. This identity—forged through centuries of struggle and self-definition—established a legacy of individual rights, due process, and a balanced approach to law and order. The Magna Carta of 1215, for instance, set a groundbreaking precedent by binding even the king to the rule of law and affirming that Englishmen were 'free-born.' This commitment was further solidified by the development of English common law, which emphasized justice and protection for all citizens, regardless of rank, including the monarch. In 1707, however, a significant shift occurred with the Act of Union, which joined England and Scotland under a single British identity. This transformation required England’s traditions of liberty and local governance to adapt to a centralized imperial authority, reconfiguring individual freedoms within a larger imperial framework. Although these ideals persisted, they began to reflect the needs of an expanding empire, aligning liberty with broader, centralized control. The legacy of English liberty stands at a precarious threshold. The recent UK government advisory, 'Think before you post,' cloaked in public welfare, quietly undermines the freedoms that once defined English identity. Once a steadfast guardian of individual rights, the government now leans toward surveillance and constraint, drifting alarmingly from its founding principles of liberty and due process. This subtle shift suggests a future where the very freedoms that shaped English society are at risk of being quietly surrendered. Evolving Traditions of English Liberty The Magna Carta was originally a series of rebellious victories that compelled the English monarchy to state rights formally that had previously been assumed. First issued in 1215 by King John under pressure from rebellious barons, the document marked a significant shift by formally acknowledging several protections like the right to fair trial and justice. Although annulled shortly after by Pope Innocent III, it was reissued in 1216, 1217, and 1225 under King Henry III, each version reinforcing the principle that the monarchy was bound by law and individual rights were inviolable. Over time, the Magna Carta became a lasting symbol of accountable governance and the protection of fundamental rights, invoked repeatedly by the English against tyranny. The Levellers adopted and expanded upon the ideas of natural law in England during the Wars of Three Kingdoms (1639 -1653), Lilburne particularly argued that government must be based on a contract with the people, one that exists to protect the 'freeborn rights' of every individual. John Lilburne, a prominent Leveller, asserted that 'every man by nature was born with as much freedom as any other man.' Furthermore, Richard Overton, another key Leveller, linked the concept of freeborn rights to the ancient liberties of England, arguing that these liberties were the birthright of every Englishman and were to be upheld by the rational law of nature. He argued that every person should be judged by the law of nature or rule of reason. He advocated for the inherent rights of self-ownership and freedom from aggression, which he believed belonged to all individuals by their humanity. The Levellers’ manifesto, An Agreement of the People, advocated for constitutional reforms to establish a government that truly represented and protected citizens’ rights, including freedom of religion, the press, and conscience. It called for equality before the law, the rule of law, protection of private property, and a democratically-elected parliament. It inspired the Radical Whigs and, subsequently, the Liberal Party. In the 19th century, the Whigs and the Liberal Party championed these principles, promoting greater suffrage, the removal of trade barriers, and the elimination of price and wage controls to foster economic freedom and market competition. The Levellers’ vision resonated with common law’s principles of due process, reason, and communal judgment. Due process mandated transparency and adherence to procedures, safeguarding against arbitrary rule. Trial by jury empowered peers to judge, highlighting fairness and public accountability. Guided by precedent, common law ensured consistency and restrained the whims of those in power, emphasizing rational adjudication and judicial independence to ground justice in enduring principles over fleeting policies. In the early 17th century, Sir Edward Coke’s interpretation of common law reshaped English legal principles by establishing a framework of liberty that bound even the monarch. His ruling in Dr. Bonham’s Case (1610) argued that 'the common law will control Acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them utterly void' if they contravene basic principles of 'common right and reason.' This marked a foundational assertion that courts could nullify laws infringing on individual rights, prefiguring the principle of judicial review that would later become central to constitutional law. Coke’s landmark work, The Institutes of the Lawes of England, expanded on this philosophy, asserting that 'the king himself ought not to be under man, but under God and the law.' This statement directly opposed the doctrine of the divine right of kings, asserting that the monarch was also bound by common law, a revolutionary stance in his era. Coke’s interpretation insisted that law was supreme over all authority, positioning the judiciary as a crucial check on both royal and parliamentary overreach. Through his legal writings and judgments, Coke codified the view of common law as a protector of inherent rights and a constraint on sovereign power. His ideas set the stage for modern constitutionalism particularly in the United States and the rest of the world, cementing judicial oversight as a safeguard against the erosion of civil liberties by any governing power. From English Liberty to Imperial Subject: The Quiet Conquest of England In his 1899 critique, The Conquest of the United States by Spain, William Graham Sumner warned with biting clarity that while the United States had vanquished Spain militarily, it stood on the precipice of an internal defeat by adopting Spain’s authoritarian practices. Sumner’s words cut to imperialism’s core: in subjugating others, a nation risks eroding its own fundamental values, reshaped by the oppressive systems it enforces abroad. His warning is a clear caution against the lure of empire, where the conqueror risks self-loss in conquest. As England’s empire expanded in the 17th and 18th centuries, local English identity gave way to an imperial British identity, dismantling centuries-old liberties. Acts like the Navigation Acts (1651), Stamp Act (1765), and Declaratory Act (1766) ravaged colonial rights, restricting trade, undermining due process, and asserting Britain’s absolute control. The 1707 Act of Union suppressed Scottish autonomy, centralizing power for imperial cohesion. This legal onslaught sacrificed the 'free-born Englishman' ideal, replacing local justice with exploitation and deepening colonial resentment. The Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 imposed taxes without colonial representation, violating the English constitutional principle that taxation required consent—rooted in the Magna Carta and reaffirmed by the 1689 Bill of Rights. These measures sowed resentment that ultimately led to the loss of the American colonies, as they fought to affirm their natural rights. The establishment of Vice-Admiralty Courts in the colonies marked a stark departure from English legal traditions. These courts, operating without juries and presided over by Crown-appointed judges, denied colonists the right to a fair trial—a bedrock of English justice. The Sugar Act of 1764 further empowered these courts to try smuggling cases that, in England, would have been heard in common law courts with juries. This denial of basic legal protections signaled Britain’s disregard for its own principles in favor of enforcing imperial dominance. The British Empire’s expansion necessitated an increasingly centralized government that directly interfered with local governance, diminishing the English tradition of decentralized authority. The Declaratory Act of 1766, for instance, unequivocally imposed Parliament’s supremacy, stripping colonial assemblies of any legislative power by allowing British lawmakers to legislate for the colonies 'in all cases whatsoever.' This act nullified the longstanding colonial self-governance system, effectively rendering local legislative bodies powerless and consolidating control in London. Moreover, the arbitrary expansion of executive power in both Britain and its colonies severely eroded the rule of law, enabling unchecked governmental authority. The Suspension of Habeas Corpus Act of 1794, enacted in response to perceived revolutionary threats, allowed indefinite detention without trial, a direct violation of the 1679 Habeas Corpus Act that had protected citizens from arbitrary imprisonment. This suspension prioritized state security over individual rights, marking a stark departure from English legal principles. In American colonies, governors wielded vast authority under the King’s commission, bypassing colonial assemblies and enacting laws or raising taxes without local consent, fueling resentment and ultimately rebellion. Such unilateral executive actions highlighted the extent to which the British Empire prioritized imperial control over the adherence to fair governance and legal integrity. In conclusion, while much of the foundational principles of English liberty has been eroded through imperial expansion and centralized authority, there is hope for a revival—a new renaissance of the ideals that once defined the nation. By reawakening the commitment to individual rights, due process, and accountable governance, society can reclaim its identity rooted in freedom and justice.

A Defining Moment In The Ukraine War – OpEd	The Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement on Thursday regarding the two attacks by Western long-range weapons on Russian territory on November 19 and 21 and Moscow’s reactive strike on a facility within Ukraine’s defence industrial complex in the city of Dnepropetrovsk with a hitherto unknown non-nuclear hypersonic ballistic missile named Oreshnik. On Friday, at a meeting in the Kremlin with the military top brass, Putin revisited the topic where he clarified that Oreshnik not really at an 'experimental' stage, as Pentagon had determined, but its serial production has actually commenced. And he added, 'Given the particular strength of this weapon, its power, it will be put into service with the Strategic Missile Forces.' He then went on to reveal, 'It is also important that along with the Oreshnik system, several similar systems are currently being tested in Russia. Based on the test results, these weapons will also go into production. In other words, we have a whole line of medium- and shorter-range systems.' Putin reflected on the geopolitical backdrop: 'The current military and political situation in the world is largely determined by the results of competition in the creation of new technologies, new weapons systems and economic development.' Succinctly put, the escalatory move authorised by the US president Joe Biden has boomeranged. Did Biden bite more than he could chew? This is the first thing. The US apparently decided that Putin’s 'red lines' and Russia’s nuclear deterrence were the stuff of rhetoric. Washington was clueless about the existence of a wonder weapon like the Oreshnik in the Russian armoury that is as demonic frightening as a nuclear missile in its sheer destructive apocalyptic potential but will spare human lives. Putin added calmly that Russia intends to give advance notice to civilians to get out of the way before Oreshnik heads for its designated target to annihilate it. The shock and awe in the western capitals speaks for itself. Biden avoided commenting on the issue when asked by reporters. The Oreshnik is not an upgrade of old Soviet-era systems but 'relies entirely on contemporary cutting-edge innovations,' Putin stressed. Izvestia reported that Oreshnik is a new generation of Russian intermediate-range missiles with a range of 2,500-3,000km and potentially extending to 5,000km, but not intercontinental, equipped with multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles (MIRV) — ie., having separating warheads with individual guidance units. It has a speed between Mach 10 and Mach 11 (exceeding 12,000 kms per hour). The Russian daily Readovka reported that with an estimated 1,500 kgs of combat payload, lifting to a maximum height of 12 km and moving at a speed of Mach 10, the Oreshnik launched from the Russian base at Kaliningrad would strike Warsaw in 1 minute 21 seconds; Berlin, 2 min 35 sec; Paris, 6 min 52 sec; and London, 6 min 56 sec. In his statement on Thursday, Putin said, 'there are no means of countering such weapons today. Missiles attack targets at a speed of Mach 10, which is 2.5 to 3 kilometres per second. Air defence systems currently available in the world and missile defence systems being created by the Americans in Europe cannot intercept such missiles. It is impossible.' Indeed, a terribly beauty is born. For, Oreshnik is not just an effective hypersonic weapon and is neither a strategic weapon nor an intercontinental ballistic missile. But its striking power is such that when used en masse and in combination with other long-range precision systems, its effect and power is on par with strategic weapons. Yet, it is not a weapon of mass destruction — rather, it’s a high-precision weapon. Serial production implies that dozens of Oreshnik are in the process of being deployed, which means that no US / NATO staff group and no Anglo-American target intelligence unit in bunkers in Kiev or Lvov is safe any longer. Oreshnik is also a signal to the incoming US president Donald Trump who is ad nauseam calling for an immediate end-of-war settlement. Oreshnik, ironically, has been developed only as Moscow’s reaction to the hawkish decision by then US president Trump in 2019 to unilaterally withdraw from the 1987 Soviet-American treaty on intermediate range nuclear forces (INF). Hence this also signals that Moscow’s trust in Trump is near zero. To drive home this point, on the very same day Oreshnik emerged out of its silo, Tass carried an unusual interview with a top Russian think tanker affiliated to the foreign ministry and Kremlin — Andrey Sushentsov, program director of the Valdai Discussion Club, dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s MGIMO International Relations Department, and member of the Scientific Council under the Russian Security Council. The following excerpts of the interview, plain-speaking and startling, should scatter the hypothesis that there is something special going on between Trump and Putin: 'Trump is considering ending the Ukrainian crisis, not out of any sympathy for Russia, but because he acknowledges that Ukraine has no realistic chance of winning. His goal is to preserve Ukraine as a tool for US interests, focusing on freezing the conflict rather than resolving it. Consequently, under Trump, the long-term strategy of countering Russia will persist. The US continues to benefit from the Ukrainian crisis, regardless of which administration is in power.' 'The United States has regained its position as the European Union’s top trading partner for the first time in years. It is the Europeans who are bearing the financial burden of prolonging the Ukrainian crisis, while the US has no interest in resolving it. Instead, it is more beneficial for them to freeze the conflict, keeping Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia and as a persistent hotspot in Europe to maintain their confrontational approach.' 'Trump has made numerous statements that differ from the policies of Joe Biden’s administration. However, the US state system is an inertial structure that resists decisions it deems contrary to American interests, so not all of Trump’s ideas will come to fruition.' 'Trump will have a two-year window before the midterm congressional elections, during which he will have a certain freedom to push his policies through the Senate and the House of Representatives. After that, his decisions could face resistance both domestically and from US allies.' Make no mistake, Russia is under no illusions. Putin will not waver from the conditions he outlined in June for resolving the conflict: the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbass and Novorossiya; Kiev’s commitment to abstain from joining NATO; the lifting of all Western sanctions against Russia; and the establishment of a non-aligned, nuclear-free Ukraine. Clearly, this war will continue on its course till it reaches its only logical conclusion, which is Russian victory. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev is spot on when he said in an interview with Al Arabiya yesterday that the use of Oreshnik missile 'changes the course' of the Ukrainian conflict. The Western capitals will have to reconcile with the reality that the scope for escalation of the war is ending. Make no mistake, if another ATAMCS strike inside Russia is attempted, it will have devastating consequences for the West. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic put it nicely: 'If you [NATO] think you can attack everything on Russian territory with Western logistics and weapons without getting a response, and that Putin won’t use whatever weapons he deems necessary, then you either don’t know him or you’re abnormal.'

Cambodia, Laos Sack Foreign Ministers In Preparation For More Com...	By David Hutt On Nov. 19, Sok Chenda Sophea, who was only brought in as Cambodia’s foreign minister last year, was given the heave-ho and replaced by his predecessor, Prak Sokhonn. The previous day, the urbane and much-praised Saleumxay Kommasith was dismissed as the foreign minister of Laos and demoted upstairs to the Prime Minister’s Office. It is unusual for foreign ministers in both countries to be reshuffled. Sok Chenda Sophea was only the third foreign minister since the ruling Cambodian People’s Party cemented its power in 1998; Saleumxay was only the fourth foreign minister since the communist takeover in Laos in 1975. In one interpretation, Saleumxay was merely a casualty of an ongoing carve-up of the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party by the Siphadones and Phomvihanes, the two most important political clans. It is expected that 2025 will be a year of horse trading and in-fighting between grandees ahead of the National Congress in January 2026, when the party’s new five-year leadership is announced. Saleumxay was replaced by Thongsavanh Phomvihane, previously head of the ruling communist party’s foreign policy commission and brother of the National Assembly chair, Saysomphone Phomvihane. Saysomphone stands a good chance of becoming the next party chief, but there are still doubts about whether Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, the scion of the Siphandone clan, will get a second term. Uncertain geopolitics ahead Once considered the party’s 'crown prince,' Sonexay’s reputation has suffered badly because of his handling of Laos’s ongoing economic catastrophe, which shows no signs of improving. Saleumxay was seen by some as a challenger to Sonexay, especially after impressing this year as the minister who guided Laos’s ASEAN chairmanship. Yet, he was not universally popular within the ruling communist party. Many apparatchiks perceived him as an aloof, independent-minded upstart who rose too quickly. Removing Saleumxay increases Sonexay’s chances of keeping his job. Putting a Phomvihane in the foreign ministry also increases that family’s influence, too. Beyond domestic political concerns, the removal of the two foreign ministers comes as their governments prepare for more uncertain times internationally. According to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, Prak’s reappointment will increase the 'government’s capabilities' amid intensifying geopolitical tensions. Prak is an experienced diplomat accustomed to fighting Cambodia’s corner amid new Cold War rivalries, whereas Sok Chenda Sophea was principally an economics-minded functionary – appointed last year because he wasn’t geopolitically-minded. The neophyte Hun Manet administration wanted a foreign minister who would focus entirely on increasing trade and investment, which was Sok Chenda Sophea’s sole remit as the former head of Cambodia’s investment council. Under Sok Chenda, the foreign ministry shifted many of its diplomatic duties, allowing it to concentrate on tapping foreign governments for more money. That left other ruling party grandees like Hun Manet and his father, Hun Sen, still in power in Phnom Penh, to operate their own foreign policy – pursuing controversial issues, like the territorial disputes with neighboring Vietnam and Thailand, that could impair economic relations. Trump tariffs Phnom Penh presumably thinks this dual system is no longer workable. Donald Trump’s return as U.S. president in 2025 means Washington will no longer separate geopolitics from trade, so it makes little sense for Phnom Penh to do so, either. Moreover, it knows it will face a much more hostile relationship with the incoming Trump administration, with its threatened blanket 10-20% tariff on global imports when the U.S. is the largest purchaser of Cambodian goods. Trump also will bring Marco Rubio in as secretary of state. Washington’s leading China hawk is expected to take a much tougher stance on Beijing’s partners in Asia, such as Cambodia, and on mainland Southeast Asia’s vast scam industry that is increasingly victimizing U.S. citizens. Unlike Sok Chenda Sophea, Prak is more of a ruling-party partisan who can push back against U.S. criticism. Presumably, Phnom Penh realizes it’ll soon have to wade into a new fight with Washington, making it even more important to be on the best terms with Beijing. Beijing won’t be displeased by Prak’s return. Attuned to Beijing China is believed to have grown weary with some of the princelings installed in Hu Manet’s cabinet during last year’s vast generational succession process. It has been lobbying for the return of Prak, an old-style politician who understands how Beijing prefers things to be done. In Vientiane, Saleumxay did a good job in recent years of pitching Laos to the rest of the world, including the West, and as the only fluent English speaker in the Politburo was key to securing some important development assistance packages from Japan, the U.S., and European states. Yet Laos’s dire economic situation, particularly its massive debts to China, isn’t improving, and only Beijing has the ability to assist meaningfully. A damning report by the IMF published last week noted that Laos’s economy 'critically relies on the continued extension of debt relief from China.' Vientiane knows it must narrow its foreign relations again to focus squarely on China. Indeed, the communist party is eager to find a more senior role for pro-Beijing figures like Sommath Pholsena, currently a deputy president of the National Assembly and a childhood friend of Xi Jinping, China’s president. He’ll likely be the next National Assembly chair. Thongsavanh Phomvihane, the new foreign minister, started his career at Laos’s embassy in Beijing, has closer ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and is more of a party loyalist than Saleumxay. Like Prak, he’s an older, more traditional and safer pair of hands, someone who understands what Beijing wants and how to provide that.

Global Shifts Suggest Syria’s ‘Waiting Game’ Could Pay Off – Anal...	By Christopher Phillips At the height of Syria’s civil war, Bente Scheller, a political scientist and former German diplomat, published 'The Wisdom of Syria’s Waiting Game.' In it, she argued that Syrian foreign policy under President Bashar Assad and, before that, his father Hafez Assad had long followed a strategy of 'waiting out' international difficulties and crises. Damascus would rarely change the policies that provoked ire from outsiders, but instead waited for former critics to soften their stance.This has been Assad’s approach since the Syria conflict exploded in 2011, refusing demands to loosen his brutal grip on power, confident that, with considerable help from allies Russia and Iran, eventually it will be his enemies that bend. Thirteen years after many in the international community cut ties with Damascus and erected sanctions, the regional climate appears to be shifting, and Assad may believe that Syria’s waiting game is once again paying off.Syria’s international rehabilitation has already begun. Even during the civil war, Damascus was never fully isolated. As well as allies Russia, Iran, and China, significant powers, notably Brazil and India, declined to sever ties. As it became clear Assad would survive, a trickle of Arab states, such as the UAE, Egypt, and Jordan, which had called for his overthrow reestablished ties. In 2023, Saudi Arabia favored Syria’s return to the Arab League after its suspension 12 years earlier.But there is still a long way to go. While back in the Arab League and attending regional events such as the recent Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, Assad is far from fully reintegrated. Jordan, among others, protests the flow of Captagon from Syria, allegedly overseen by the Assad regime, while trade and diplomatic relations with the Arab world remain far below pre-2011 levels. Despite low-level talks with Ankara, detente with Turkiye appears to have stalled over continued Turkish control of northern Syria. Meanwhile, relations with the EU and the US remain severed, with economic sanctions still in place.However, three recent developments could shift the dial. First, the Lebanon war. Almost 500,000 people have sought sanctuary in Syria since October, mostly Syrians who fled war in their own country during the previous decade. This helps Assad paint a more positive international image of his war-torn state — even if many refugees are reportedly trying to move on to either Iraq or rebel-held northern Syria. It also increases Syria’s importance to the international aid community and raises the, albeit remote, possibility that Damascus might be included in Lebanese peace talks.A further benefit is that though the decimation of its ally Hezbollah is a blow, it shifts the balance in the Hezbollah-Syria-Iran relationship more in Assad’s favor. Second, the continued rise of populist right-wing parties in Europe increases the chance that ties with the continent could improve. Populist governments in Hungary and Italy have already pushed for the EU to loosen sanctions in exchange for Assad taking back Syrian refugees, and Rome even reopened its Damascus embassy in September.A key development could be the German elections in February, should this result in a far-right Alternative for Germany triumph. Germany and France have led EU opposition to Assad and pushed against those calling for improving ties. But the AFD met with Syrian officials in 2019, and has previously mooted collaborating with Assad to repatriate many of the Syrians living in Germany. Even if the AFD is frozen out of government by other parties, a strong election performance might persuade Germany’s leaders to alter their uncompromising stance on Assad.Finally, there is the reelection of Donald Trump. On the one hand, there are signs that Trump’s return could benefit Assad. His pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently noted how Trump wants to remove US troops from northeastern Syria. This would likely benefit Assad, who wants to recapture all this region. Kurdish forces, currently administering there under US protection, would probably be forced to reconcile with Assad in the face of the alternative: attack by Turkiye. Such an outcome could also help oil the stalled detente with Ankara. Neutralizing the Kurdish autonomous region might lessen Turkish security concerns or, alternatively, Assad might be more open to a phased Turkish withdrawal from the north, having recently captured the east.It is also possible that Assad’s relative neutrality during the Gaza war — not joining its allies Iran and Hezbollah in fighting Israel — may be rewarded with a less hawkish approach from the Trump administration. Tulsi Gabbard, named as director of national intelligence, visited Syria and met Assad in 2017 while a Congresswoman, and her nomination supports the possibility that the new White House could be less hostile. A softer US view of Russia under Trump might also benefit Assad. While the lifting of US sanctions on Damascus appears unlikely, Assad may hope that a less aggressive White House will enforce them less vigilantly.Yet, Trump showed during his first term how unpredictable he can be, and his approach could easily break the other way. Should Trump ramp up his hostility to Iran, as he did before, Assad is unlikely to cut ties with Tehran, which remains the cornerstone of Syria’s foreign policy. In such circumstances, Syria could once again be in Trump’s crosshairs.However, although the geopolitical wheel appears to be turning, it is far from clear Assad will seize this opportunity. It requires considerable diplomatic skill to utilize these changing circumstances effectively. Although the Syrian leader has followed his father’s 'waiting game' diplomacy, it is yet to be seen if he has inherited Hafez Assad’s ability to navigate a way back into international favor. Despite more advantageous conditions, Syria could yet remain a relative pariah. • Christopher Phillips is professor of international relations at Queen Mary University of London and author of ‘Battleground: Ten Conflicts that Explain the New Middle East.’ X: @cjophillips	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF3HzjBmuI2jm	2024-11-24T15:57:57-08:00	
ZAVNOBiH And The Continuity Of Statehood In Bosnia And Herzegovin...	By Dr Mirko Pejanović Following the loss of its state independence in 1463 during the medieval era, Bosnia and Herzegovina remained a distinct multi-confessional, multicultural, and geographically cohesive entity until the mid-20th century, under the rule of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, and later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This status persisted until the imposition of King Alexander I Karadjordjević's January 6th Dictatorship in 1929 and the subsequent reorganisation of Yugoslavia into nine banovinas. Between 1941 and 1945, during the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina became the primary battleground for National Liberation and the anti-fascist struggle led by partisan forces against the occupying powers on Yugoslav territory. The idea of ZAVNOBiH emerged within the framework of the National Liberation Movement. After the organisational and political arrangements were made, the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) convened on 25 November 1943 in Mrkonjić Grad. During this First Session, 247 delegates from across Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted a historic decision to restore and re-establish the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the will of the councillors of the First Session of ZAVNOBiH, Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised as a federal state unit within the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, enjoying equal status with the other five Yugoslav republics. This decision was confirmed at the Second Session of AVNOJ on 29 November 1943. During the three-year national liberation and anti-fascist struggle, the citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina secured the right to politically shape and organise their homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a fraternal and indivisible state union—a union that enshrines the national equality of Croats, Serbs, and Muslims (Bosniaks). The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a federal state unit within the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was solidified through the decisions made at the Second Session of ZAVNOBiH (Sanski Most 1944.), particularly in terms of establishing state institutions. At this session, the Decision on the Structure and Organisation of National Liberation Committees and the Declaration on Citizens’ Rights were adopted, guaranteeing democratic freedoms for citizens as individuals and equality among the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At its Third Session, held in liberated Sarajevo in 1945, ZAVNOBiH transformed into the Provisional People's Assembly and passed the Law on the Formation of the First People's Government of Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina. The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, grounded in the principles of ZAVNOBiH, was constitutionally defined with the adoption of the First Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Constitutional Assembly of Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1946. Since then, Bosnia and Herzegovina has functioned as a people's state with a republican system of governance. More than four decades of peaceful development For over four decades, Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced peaceful development, characterised by complete unity in managing economic and social growth. Between the early 1960s and the 1990s, the country achieved remarkable progress and renewal in both economic and cultural spheres. Its economy was restructured, transitioning from basic to processing industries, and employment reached one million citizens. The population grew to over four million. All children of primary school age were included in basic education. In addition to the University of Sarajevo, universities were established in Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Mostar. The Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ANUBiH) was also founded. All 109 municipalities were connected to Sarajevo, the capital, by paved roads. In the late 1960s, a historic decision formally recognised the national identity of the Muslim (Bosniak) people. This process of full national emancipation went hand in hand with the strengthening of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s autonomy and statehood within the Yugoslav Federation. The introduction of a multi-party system At the beginning of the 1990s, as the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation entered its final stage, Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the historic challenge of transitioning to political pluralism by introducing a multi-party system and deciding its political future through democratic means. The multi-party Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, elected in the country’s first multi-party elections in 1990, passed a decision in January 1992 to hold a citizens’ referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereign and independent state-legal status. All political parties, both ruling and opposition, supported the referendum, with the exception of Karadžić’s Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). In collaboration with Milošević’s regime, the SDS sought to dismantle and deny Bosnia and Herzegovina’s historically established republican statehood. Through their democratic will, with a 64% voter turnout from all ethnic groups and 99% support for the referendum question, citizens decided that their country, homeland, and state should attain the status of a sovereign and independent nation. In this way, they determined the future of their Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on democratic and anti-fascist principles. Honouring the will of the citizens, the countries of the European Union, the United States, and a vast number of countries across the world granted Bosnia and Herzegovina international recognition in early April 1992. This overwhelming support from the global community culminated on 22 May 1992, when Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted as a full member of the United Nations. With its internationally recognised borders, Bosnia and Herzegovina attained international legal subjectivity in the final decade of the 20th century. Through the citizens’ referendum and the international recognition of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the democratic forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina successfully countered efforts to divide the country and dismantle its republican statehood during this turbulent period. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina was denied the opportunity to peacefully develop its sovereign statehood and independence. This peaceful course was violently disrupted by an aggressive war imposed by Milošević’s regime. By the late 1980s, this regime had seized control of the former Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA), bringing it under its command. Using the military power of the JNA—renamed the Army of the Republic of the Serbian People in May 1992—ethnic cleansing of non-Serb populations was conducted in the territory declared as the Republic of the Serbian People. This campaign culminated in mass atrocities against civilians and the genocide of Bosniaks in Srebrenica. Resistance and defence of the sovereignty and multi-ethnic character of the state Democratic and patriotic forces mobilised to resist and defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and multi-ethnic identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Leading the organisation of this resistance and defence was the multi-ethnic Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The wartime Presidency of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ensured political unity in directing the country’s defence efforts. This unity was defined in the Platform for the Activity of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Conditions of War, which reaffirmed the principles of ZAVNOBiH in light of new historical circumstances. Based on this Platform, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were established, with the defence of the country led by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Diplomatic efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the war were pursued through the state delegation’s engagement with peace plans within the framework of international peace conferences. After the United States assumed leadership in shaping peace initiatives, the Washington Peace Agreement was signed in 1994, followed by the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995. With the Dayton Peace Agreement of November 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina entered a historic era of peacebuilding and the development of state institutions. This process was based on the internationalisation of peacebuilding efforts, with the international community and the European Union authorised to play a role in fostering peace, strengthening the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and integrating it into Euro-Atlantic institutions (the Council of Europe, the European Union, and NATO). It is certain that compliance with the EU acquis during Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership negotiations will further develop solutions for the functioning of state institutions, which remain significantly constrained by the Dayton Constitution. At the start of the 21st century, a historic challenge emerged in the form of accelerating Bosnia and Herzegovina's integration into the European Union. One of the key factors behind this momentum has been the geopolitical changes in Europe and beyond. Since 2022, peace in Europe—and consequently in the Western Balkans—has been jeopardised due to the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, violating its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In response to this threat, the institutions of the European Union decided, at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status for EU membership and to open accession negotiations. For Bosnia and Herzegovina, achieving membership in the European Union means overcoming the challenge of becoming a democratic, lawful, and economically prosperous state within the community of free nations and states in Europe. The majority of citizens strongly support an accelerated path toward EU membership, aspiring to achieve this goal by the end of the third decade of the 21st century. To realise this objective, comprehensive measures are required to ensure the effective functioning of the parliamentary majority at the state level. In this context, it is crucial to develop a unified reform agenda and establish full coordination between the activities of the international community and EU institutions on one side, and governing parties and civil society organisations on the other. Reinforcing political pluralism on civic principles It is essential to halt the destructive impact of ethno-nationalist policies and strengthen political pluralism based on civic foundations. One of the key levers for accelerating Bosnia and Herzegovina’s integration into the European Union is the inclusion of a European clause in the country’s Constitution. This provision would facilitate the swift adoption of legislation enabling the transposition of the Acquis Communautaire by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this context, intensifying the activities of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) would be crucial. Leveraging its Bonn powers, the OHR should impose sanctions and exert various forms of pressure to eliminate individuals and entities that promote institutional blockades, deny Bosnia and Herzegovina’s statehood, undermine the Dayton Peace Agreement, or endanger peace in the public political arena. The rising threat of nationalism advocating the secession of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina poses a serious risk to the country’s peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Preventing the evident dangers of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s disintegration will require the international community and the country’s democratic, multi-ethnic forces to accelerate its integration into the European Union. In addition to the threat of secession, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also grappling with the danger of demographic depletion caused by the large-scale emigration of its working-age population to European Union countries.

Sudan’s War Threatens To Create Widespread Ethnic Conflict – Anal...	Sudan’s war is inflaming ethnic tensions across the country and threatening to turn the battle between two military factions into a broader war along tribal lines. 'The escalation of war narratives by both sides is fueling ethnically charged rhetoric,' the Advocacy Group for Peace in Sudan (AGPS) said in a statement. The group said that inflammatory claims by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have spurred dangerous regional and ethnic mobilization. The AGPS compared Sudan’s rising ethnic animosity to the early stages of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. 'Sudan stands on the brink,' the group wrote, urging leaders on both sides to moderate their rhetoric and seek a peaceful solution to the conflict that has killed more than 62,000 and displaced millions since April 2023. Observers say attacks by the RSF on civilians in the al-Gezira and Darfur regions, among others, are driving the rise of ethnic militias as a form of communal self-defense. 'There is no safe place in Sudan now,' Mohamed Chande Othman, head of a recent United Nations fact-finding mission, said in a statement. In al-Gezira, the RSF launched a series of ethnically motivated attacks after one of its local leaders, Abu Agla Keikil, defected to the SAF. The attacks killed 124 civilians and led to more than 37 sexual assaults, according to journalist Martin Plaut, who writes about insecurity in the Horn of Africa. Plaut reported that five RSF advisors defected at the end of October. In Darfur, RSF assaults on non-Arab tribal groups, such as the Masalit, have mirrored the genocidal attacks on the population that the RSF’s predecessor, the Janjaweed, launched in Darfur 20 years ago. The RSF draws from Darfur’s ethnically Arab Rizeigat community. Sudan’s ethnically motivated attacks in West Darfur have included abductions of young and old women by RSF fighters for sexual slavery. Victims have reported their attackers telling them: 'We will make you, the Masalit girls, give birth to Arab children.' Ethnic attacks in Darfur prompted two local militias, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement, to align themselves with the SAF against the RSF in April. Both groups are based in the non-Arab Fur, Zaghawa and Masalit communities. A day later, RSF fighters burned down several non-Arab villages in North Darfur. With 19 major ethnic groups and nearly 600 sub-groups among its 49 million citizens, Sudan risks devolving further into intertribal conflict as the war between the SAF and RSF continues, according to observers. If that happens, Sudan’s conflict could engulf neighboring Chad, which shares tribal ties along its border with Darfur. The Zaghawa tribe, for example, spans the Chad-Sudan border. So does the Rizeigat group that makes up much of the RSF. A tribal conflict in North Darfur could draw in fighters from Chad, according to Remadji Hoinathy, an expert with South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies. 'Zaghawa people from remote villages in Chad — who live along the border and are very armed — could absolutely be implicated in the conflict [in North Darfur],' Hoinathy told Al Jazeera. To reduce the threat of widespread tribal conflict, Sudan’s leadership must address Sudan’s historic ethnic and wealth disparities to build a common vision of the future, according to Hamdy A. Hassan. 'Achieving peace in Sudan requires a focus on the concerns of marginalized populations in conflict zones and deprived regions,' Hassan, a professor at Zayed University in the United Arab Emirates, wrote in The Conversation. 'It also requires addressing the root causes of armed violence.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF7-Nmm3a1kIP	2024-11-24T15:54:42-08:00	
India’s Caste Census Will Act As A hindrance To National Unity An...	The caste system, deeply rooted in India's socio-cultural fabric, has historically influenced various aspects of life, including social status, economic opportunities, and access to resources. The idea of conducting a caste census in India has sparked considerable debate, especially regarding its impact on meritocracy and its potential as a tool for equitable development. Even after 75 years of independence, India continues to wrestle with the complexities of the caste system, a challenge further compounded by vote-bank politics. The debate over conducting a caste census has intensified, raising significant concerns about its potential impact on meritocracy and the country's socio-economic development. Although, the intention behind the census is to address historical inequities, such measures risk exacerbating societal divisions. Recently, several states have conducted caste-based censuses to create a development model that addresses economic disparities and provides equal opportunities for marginalised communities. The goal is to identify these groups and direct resources toward their upliftment. While such initiatives seek to rectify social inequality and the unequal distribution of resources in India, they also present certain challenges. A caste census would generate detailed data on the socio-economic conditions of various caste groups, which could inform targeted policies to reduce disparities. However, while increasing reservations is designed to address economic gaps and offer equal opportunities to historically marginalised communities, it could undermine meritocracy in India. Marginalised communities often suffer from poor socio-economic conditions, which limit their access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential resources, putting them at a disadvantage despite their potential. The caste system, deeply embedded in India's socio-cultural fabric, continues to influence social status, economic opportunities, and access to resources. The impact of reservation policies on merit has already been evident, particularly in government services, universities, and academic institutions. One prominent example is the way candidates are elected based on caste, especially in the Hindi heartland. In India, it is often challenging for an intellectual, no matter how capable, to win elections on merit alone. One of the major drawbacks of increasing reservations based on caste is that the caste census could further undermine the principle of meritocracy by placing too much emphasis on caste-based benefits. However, a broader view of meritocracy reveals that it is not just about academic qualifications; it's about creating a level playing field. A caste census could help identify and nurture untapped talent by providing opportunities and resources to historically deprived communities. A More Inclusive Model Critics argue that caste-based reservations risk prioritizing benefits based on identity over ability, potentially undermining meritocracy. However, creating a truly meritocratic society requires equal opportunities for all, regardless of caste or background. The government could consider an alternative model where reservations are based on income rather than caste. This approach would provide benefits to economically disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their caste, ensuring that those with merit from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), or any other economically disadvantaged group could benefit equally. The caste system has polarized Indian society, creating divisions that weaken the social fabric. A more inclusive approach—one that considers both socioeconomic disadvantages and individual merit—could foster a more just and equitable society. True meritocracy is not just about academic scores and qualifications; it's about allowing everyone to realize their potential. Currently, India's reliance on quotas has often compromised merit. Decisions based on caste alone only deepen this divide, further eroding meritocracy by limiting opportunities for those with potential. The Way Forward If India is to achieve its development goals, it must reassess its reservation policies and embrace reforms that prioritize both equity and merit. Shifting the focus to socioeconomic status, rather than caste identity, could pave the way for a more united, just, and progressive nation. The caste census is socially divisive, and it is time for politicians to rise above caste-based politics and focus on the well-being of economically disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their caste. Unfortunately, many leaders lack the political will to move away from the caste-based quota system, which has worked in their favour. However, if India is to emerge as a global power committed to justice and equity, leaders must support a model that promotes reservations based on economic need. This would ensure that even those who do not belong to reserved categories but come from poor backgrounds are not excluded from the benefits of development.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFxtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-24T15:52:55-08:00	
To Understand Trump, Take Him Seriously, But Not Literally – OpEd	By Josep M. Colomer To try to foresee the next four years with US President-Elect Donald Trump, we should remember what we learned during his first presidential term: It is a mistake to take him literally and mock him because he is not serious in his bravado. Better the other way: Take him seriously, but not literally. Trump’s advantage is that he is not guided by rigid ideological principles, in contrast to the bellicosity of both the 'neocons' and the 'woke,' but is open to pragmatic transactions — always, of course, if they satisfy his vanity or his business. Another advantage of his, paradoxically, is that there will be open results due to his incompetence and disorder. Let us review the agenda. The number one problem in the world today, and Trump’s greatest threat, is the climate crisis, which is accelerating its destructive consequences. Trump will undoubtedly promote fossil production, but the Environmental Protection Agency will maintain the protective and preventive regulations established over the past few years, 12 states will continue to apply restrictions on emissions, and large cities will continue to spread renewable energy. Regarding immigration, this time Trump did not insist on the wall (most of which he failed to build while he was last in the White House). In this campaign, he turned to 'mass deportations,' which can mean common-sense controls to cross the border, as already agreed with the Mexican government regarding non-Mexicans, or an illusory hunt for individuals without proper documents in neighborhoods, workplaces and family homes, which would not only be savage but logistically unfeasible. In reality, it is to be hoped that Congress will reactivate the bipartisan agreement for immigrants’ legalization and access to citizenship that Trump ordered to be stopped not because of its content but because it would have been approved during the campaign and would have taken away his favorite topic for demagoguery. As for Israel and Palestine, the biggest problem is that Trump is now prioritizing enmity with Iran, which finances and pushes Hamas and Hezbollah and whose agents tried to assassinate him twice (or perhaps thrice). He will have a hard time resurrecting the Abraham Accords that his Jewish son-in-law negotiated during his first term: exploring again the two-state solution in exchange for diplomatic recognition of Israel by Arab countries. Now, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will only accept it if Trump diminishes his hostility against Iran, where a 'reformist' candidate won the presidential election and seems to have appeased the fury. Regarding Ukraine, Trump boasted that he would 'fix it in 24 hours,' but was not very specific. Two days after the election, at the Valdai Forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin rushed to offer a peace agreement based on the 'self-determination' of the people of Donbas in exchange for respecting Ukraine’s borders. Putin also hinted that Russia could restore natural gas supplies through the Baltic to Germany, which Ukrainian agents destroyed. A Trump adviser has outlined a plan to defend Ukraine’s neutrality outside NATO for the next twenty years. All this sounds similar to the Minsk Agreements reached a few years ago by Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, which US President Barack Obama ignored. In the face of Trump’s disdain, the European Union may reinforce internal solidity and external autonomy. Many NATO members are already ceasing to be free-riders on the United States and are fulfilling their commitment to invest at least 2% of GDP in defense. Their number has risen from four to 23 in just six years. The biggest alarm raised by Trump’s election is that the future of democracy and legal security in the United States may be in jeopardy. Will there be 'revenge' against 'internal enemies,' and will he go after politicians, judges, generals, officials, journalists and other opponents? He may not need to once the pending court cases are canceled and he has satisfied his obsession with returning to power. The Senate Republican group has already rejected Trump’s nominee to lead it, and the Senate can veto some of his announced appointees. It is worth remembering that in his first term, Trump appointed three Chiefs of Staff in four years and changed most members of the Cabinet, including State, Defense, Justice, Interior and Homeland Security, a tenor of personal instability that is likely to continue. Some of Trump’s boasts may end in a major ridicule, such as ordering Elon Musk to cut a third of the budget. Incompetence could also sink him in the face of some unforeseen catastrophe, as happened to during US President George Bush’s second term with Hurricane Katrina and to himself with the COVID-19 pandemic. Will Trump be able to maintain a regular daily work schedule in his eighties, or will he, like Joe Biden, be busy only from 10 AM to 4 PM? It is not guaranteed that he will complete four years in good shape. Ultimately, Trump could also become a chaotic parody of the befuddled White House visitor in the film Being There (1979). As Mister Chance says, 'I can’t write. I can’t read. But I like to watch television.' Just like Donald the Returned.

Pam Bondi – Everything You Need To Know About Trump’s New AG Pick...	By James Fite Just hours after former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) bowed out as the US attorney general nominee, President-elect Donald Trump announced a replacement: Pam Bondi. As another longtime staunch Trump ally, Bondi may be everything the incoming president wants in an AG without all the scandal Gaetz brought to the table. The right loves her, and the left fears her, but who is this woman who may soon be in charge of the Department of Justice? Here’s everything you need to know about Pam Bondi but were afraid to ask. An Impressive Résumé The best place to start is where she has been and what she has accomplished – and that’s quite an impressive list. After more than 18 years as a Florida prosecutor, Pam Bondi burst onto the political scene in 2010 after she was elected to be the Sunshine State’s first female attorney general, a job she held until 2019. If confirmed, she’ll be just the third woman to serve as US attorney general. In her time as Florida’s AG, Bondi worked to end the opioid epidemic and shut down pill mills. Her approach resulted in a 52% decline in oxycodone deaths and an overall decline of 23% in prescription drug overdose deaths in Florida between 2011 and 2014, then-CDC Director Tom Frieden explained at the 2016 National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. An 'unprecedented national achievement,' he called it. She also tackled human trafficking and pushed the state’s crime lab to clear the backlog of more than 13,000 unprocessed sexual assault kits. Bondi overhauled the state’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and obtained more than $870 million in settlements and judgments. She also fought for consumer rights. In her tenure, she helped recover more than $1 billion in consumer protection, antitrust, and false claims settlements. She has since made a name for herself as a Trump ally. She served on his defense team during the first impeachment trial and co-chaired his 2020 re-election campaign. Bondi also served as chair for the Center of Litigation and co-chair of the Center of Law and Justice for the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank established in 2021 by former Trump advisers. Pam Bondi – The Left’s New Boogeyman? Even CNN Legal Analyst Elie Honig had to admit that 'Pam Bondi is, without a question, qualified to be Attorney General.' He went on to explain that Bondi’s level of experience is 'on par with, or better than most United States Attorneys General that we’ve seen over the past 50 years or so.' As impressive as her résumé is, however, you won’t read about it in the 'what to know about Pam Bondi' articles published by most left-leaning news outlets. About halfway down the AP’s piece, for example, Bondi’s work gets a one-line mention: 'As Florida’s top prosecutor, Bondi stressed human trafficking issues and urged tightening state laws against traffickers.' That, plus the fact she was the state’s first female attorney general, is about all the credit she gets. The AP and the many establishment news outlets that seem to practically copy and paste from it focus instead on Bondi’s loyalty to Trump, her work as a lobbyist, and 'a few of her own political issues.' Bondi issued an apology in 2013 after she looked to delay the execution of a convicted killer 'because it conflicted with a fundraiser for her reelection campaign.' She also received a $25,000 campaign contribution in 2013 from Donald Trump, around the same time her office declined to participate in New York’s lawsuit over fraud allegations involving Trump University. To quote Fox News’ Jesse Watters, 'you know Bondi’s a winner because the deep state sounds awfully nervous.' Indeed, the AP does come out and say that, if confirmed, 'Bondi would instantly become one of the most closely watched members of Trump’s Cabinet given the Republican’s threat to pursue retribution against perceived adversaries and concern among Democrats that he will look to bend the Justice Department to his will.' A bit farther down, the outlet claims Trump 'sought to use the powers of the Justice Department to advance his own interests,' and that Bondi 'appears likely to oblige him.' College professor and MSNBC contributor Jason Johnson revealed the real reason the left fears her. In a talk with MSNBC host Ari Melber, Johnson explained: 'Pam Bondi is exactly what I was saying in the last segment that we should all fear, because she’s competent. We may not agree with her ideologically, but she actually knows how to do this job.' He continued: 'So if anyone on the Democratic side or anyone who cared about liberty or justice was thinking ‘Well maybe Matt Gaetz will screw this up and that will give us time,’ no. Pam Bondi knows what she is doing.' Regardless of where one falls on the ideological spectrum, the thoroughly freaked-out progressive left is right about a few things: Pam Bondi is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump. She’s also far more likely to see a successful confirmation than the scandal-mired Matt Gaetz. And she does, in fact, know what she’s doing.

ECOWAS Collapses Abidjan-Lagos Highway – OpEd	Never underestimate the power of Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), also known as CEDEAO in French and Portuguese, created on 28th May 1975 as a regional political and economic union bringing together fifteen (15) countries of West Africa. Per the date of its established, this so-called regional bloc marks its 50th year in 2025, a significant historical celebration. Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African Economic Community (AEC), ECOWAS generally has its primary common goal of working consistently towards achieving, what is first referred to, as 'collective self-sufficiency' for its member states by creating a single large trade bloc by building a full economic and trading union. Additionally, ECOWAS aims to raise living standards of an estimated population of over 425 million people and to promote economic development based on the principles of inter-dependence, solidarity, and cooperation. Until writing this article, ECOWAS has frequently been discussing and reviewing the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Development Project, one single regional infrastructure project these several years. It has shown its total commitment looking for funding while billions have been siphoned by leaders into foreign banks. African leaders are quick negotiating and paying for foreign military weapons but grossly unsuccessful in soliciting similar assistance from these external partners to invest in infrastructure development such as the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Development Project. West African Highway Launched in 2017 The construction of this proposed grandiose West African highway has its own chequered history. The proposed project was successfully launched in 2017, and since then it has had series of high-powered meetings and conferences, technical studies has been conducted, and financing the construction and to its feasibility and practical operationalization. The Abidjan-Lagos highway, the six-lane dual carriage highway, is estimated at $15.1 billion. On resource mobilization, it was explicitly noted that ECOWAS had adopted a new regulatory framework on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) – an incentive for the entry of private sector in large investments like the nature of this project. The African Development Bank (AfDB) on behalf of the development partners offered its assurance for unwavering commitment to the realization of the highway. Akinwunmi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) has several times highlighted the importance of the Abidjan-Lagos highway as an infrastructure project in West Africa that would ease free movement of people, goods and services, generate social and economic activities, and ultimately promote cross-border trade within the region, its economic viability and enormous potentials especially now that African Union looks to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Noticeably, Africa has long been considered as a frontier for manufacturing, for technology, for food production. Africa is getting ready for business, it is busily building the world's largest single market of 1.4 billion people. Special Meetings and Technical Consultations Several meetings upon meetings, and upon meetings have been held since the project was proposed in 2017. Since 2017, paid meetings were held, experts were paid. The latest of such paid meeting was held in November 10-11, 2024. This roundtable was initiated following the instructions given to the ECOWAS Commission. Late September 2024, such roundtable meeting was held in Abidjan, capital city of Côte d'Ivoire, under the auspices of the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID). The highway corridor is calculated to be approximately 1,080 km long. It will connect some of the largest and most economically dynamic cities Abidjan, Accra, Cotonou, Lomé and Lagos, while covering a large proportion of West Africa's population. It will also link very vibrant seaports in West Africa. In addition, it will serve all the landlocked ECOWAS member-states, for example Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the region. Nearly 40 million people are estimated to be living along the Abidjan-Lagos corridor while 47 million people travel along the axis every year. These are expected to be direct beneficiaries of the development of the project touted to be a real backbone of trade in the region. According official documents, this highway project falls in line with the key objectives of the ECOWAS Vision 2050, including (i) facilitating the movement of people and goods, and (ii) accelerating trade and transport, regional and international, improving road infrastructure. It is eventually expected that the transport corridor will be transformed into a development corridor to stimulate investment, sustainable development and poverty reduction within the entire region. West African Highway and AfCFTA The focal point of controversy and debate, these several years, are centered on mechanism of financing, the state-of-the-art management of this new mega-highway - from planning through practical construction to its final commissioning, ready for cutting-edge usage by the transport industry. The idea of prioritizing highway innovation, signalling a bold leap in West Africa's transportation infrastructure, is its recognizable potential transformative impact. Simply intended to improve and facilitate movement of services, goods and people across the region. The Abidjan-Lagos Highway highlights its potential to enhance regional connectivity and drive economic growth, especially with the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade (AfCFTA), the ambitious flagship of the African Union (AU). According to ECOWAS latest document issued after their two-day special meeting held on November 11 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 'experts have lauded findings of the study which has among others, unveiled a potential $6.8 billion investment prepared and ready to be implemented to unlock economic growth and enhance the viability of the proposed highway.' The overall objective is to identify and unlock the inherent and latent economic potential (short, medium and long-term) and commercial viability of economic and industrial value chain projects. These economic projects, once implemented, will also generate trade volumes and traffic to augment the viability of the highway. The final draft reports were issued after groups revisited (that was not the first time) several tolled bridges and roads in Abidjan for knowledge and experience sharing strategy envisaged for the Abidjan-Lagos Highway. At the end of the exercise, the study report (re)validated commitment to unlock the inherent and latent economic potential of the highway construction and estimated at $6.8 billion in potential investment in the region. Final Construction Still Out of Sight For the past few years, significant attention have been drawn by widely publicized announcement of securing enough funds from African banks and from external sources for the construction this regional highway which could become a cornerstone, and the public narrative of achievement by ECOWAS, which marks its 50th year in 2025. However, transport industry analysts, researchers and experts have already cast serious doubts and skyline skepticism if ECOWAS could live to this onerous task. Grandiose ceremony-infested ECOWAS future task of achieving its primary target of constructing 'speed-highway' remains an eternal dream. Noticeably, ECOWAS has little to celebrate, except its existence by name, (the golden jubilee) at its 50th year in May 2025. At least, Africans will rather jubilate over the authenticity of reforming and transforming the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF-Fb4avN7oh8	2024-11-24T15:46:32-08:00	
Pro-West PM Leads Romanian Presidential Vote, Russia-Friendly Can...	(RFE/RL) -- Partial preliminary results in Romania's presidential vote give Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu a narrow lead, but a surprisingly strong showing by pro-Russia candidate Cailin Georgescu has thrown the race into unexpected territory. With 80 percent of polling stations reporting on November 24, the pro-Western Social Democrat Ciolacu had 22.17 percent of the vote, according to election officials. But his opponent in an expected runoff round remains unclear after Georgescu – who has been criticized for his anti-NATO sentiments – was in second place with 22.11 percent. Pro-West Elena Lasconi of the center-right Save Romania Union was third with 14.97 percent, while George Simion of ultranationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR) had 14.94 percent. Experts said that results from the large cities – where Ciolacu and Lasconi are likely to poll stronger than Georgescu – could still decide the tight race. Two exit polls gave Ciolacu 25 percent of the vote, while Lasconi was second at around 18 percent. Georgescu and Simion trailed in the exit polls with 14-16 percent in the cluttered field of 13 candidates. The exit polls did not include diaspora polling, where Lasconi and Simion were expected to lead the balloting. Some observers said that even with Ciolacu's slim lead, the far right appeared to be the big winner in the vote. If no candidate receives over 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held on December 8 featuring the two top finishers, a week after a parliamentary election on December 1. Ciolacu was the favorite heading into the election and pre-vote surveys indicated five candidates had a shot at advancing to the runoff to succeed the outgoing center-right incumbent, Klaus Iohannis, who is completing his second and final term after a decade in office. Fourteen candidates officially registered in the race, but Ludovic Orban announced he was withdrawing from the contest. Election officials put the turnout at just over 50 percent, or about 9.44 million voters casting their ballots. Long lines were reported at polling stations in the capital, Bucharest, ahead of the 9 p.m. poll closings. In 2019, total first-round turnout was 51.18 percent. In the second round, it rose to 55.1 percent. At three polling stations, turnout was reported at 150-300 percent. Officials said the high figure was due to supplemental lists holding more names than the permanent lists and by people voting in precincts they were not originally assigned. Georgescu, 62, who has been criticized in the Romanian media for expressing pro-Russia sentiments, claimed his shocking vote total represents a real victory for Romania. 'The rich of the system have become poorer, and the poor Romanians have become richer. It's an astonishing awakening in consciousness,' said the candidate, who utilized the TikTok social media platform to press his campaign. Following release of the exit polls, Lasconi told reporters that the results remain tight and that she will wait until official results are clear before 'rejoicing' over her potential placement in the runoff. Lasconi, a former small-town mayor and journalist, was the only presidential candidate who opposed the idea of Ukraine giving up land to Russia in a peace deal, saying doing so would embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'If Ukraine cedes territory, Putin won't stop,' she had said. 'We need to help Ukraine win this war.' She was also the most bullish among the top candidates on NATO, calling for the military alliance to have a greater presence in Romania. Ciolacu expressed pro-Europe sentiment leading up to the election. 'We will support the deepening of the European integration project for the benefit of citizens, and we will have a more active voice in the decision-making process at the European level,' he has said. Critics have charged Simion with being too Russia-friendly and, while he wants Romania to remain in NATO, said Bucharest should be 'neutral.' Despite the exit polls, Simion expressed confidence in reaching the second round. 'We were alone against the parties of the system, and we will enter the second round,' said Simion, who urged his supports to 'turn off the TVs' and ignore reports stating that a 'stranger,' Georgescu -- who had received little attention ahead of the vote -- was ahead of him in the exit polls. Romania has become a key ally of Ukraine, not only providing training and military equipment but playing a key role in transporting Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods to global markets. Much of the credit for Bucharest's pro-Ukraine stance goes to the incumbent, Iohannis. Rima, a voter at a Bucharest polling station, told RFE/RL, 'There should be more opportunities for young people, so we don't have to leave the country after we graduate from high school or college.' 'The president should be more open-minded on some topics, especially international ones. That's what I want: to live in a free country where we as young people have a voice,' she said, without specifying her candidate. Romania's president has significant decision-making powers, including on matters of national security and foreign policy. Elected for a five-year term, the president can also reject party nominees for prime minister and government nominees for judicial appointments. Diaspora voting began on November 23, with initial figures indicating a higher turnout than in 2019 among those abroad, with about 675,000 of such votes cast by 6 p.m. on November 24, up about 90,000 from the 2019 election. In Moldova, more than 80,942 voted at 59 polling stations, with officials calling it a record high. In the first round of the 2019 Romanian presidential election, 43,307 people voted in Moldova. Most of Moldova was part of Romania until the end of World War II and many Moldovans also hold Romanian citizenship. Voting was also reported to be high in London, where almost 8,900 Romanians went to the polls. Oana Popescu-Zamfir, director of the Bucharest-based think tank GlobalFocus Center, told RFE/RL in an email that this is a high-stakes election for the NATO and EU nation. 'Romania is faced with two important realities next year: the threat of further instability and conflict in the region and globally, especially in the context of a [President-elect Donald] Trump White House,' she said, along with the risks of a 'deepening economic and financial crisis.' Foreign policy is also of concern to voters, namely Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and how that conflict could change with a switch in Washington from U.S. President Joe Biden, who has steadily backed Kyiv, to Trump, who has suggested support could be curtailed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF5fa9AtxhdHe	2024-11-24T15:44:56-08:00	
Ralph Nader: From Mount Trump – How Trump Sees His World – OpEd	Let’s look at the political scene from Trump’s viewpoint. Sitting in his luxurious Mar-a-Lago palace receiving the daily obeisant supplicants eager to heed his every word and praise exuberantly his megalomania, Donald J. Trump can hardly believe his good fortune. Starting in the 2015 presidential race against 16 GOP primary opponents, Trump’s vituperative attacks were unleashed. Never in American history have words from a politician’s mouth ever metastasized into such unchallenged electoral victory and domination. His daily, hourly bullying verbal abuses flooded THE MASS MEDIA, which faithfully transmitted to tens of millions of people like clockwork – lying or false statements and tweets in the tens of thousands. Looking over his gigantic domain astride the country and soon the world, Trump can recount the pillars of his elected dictatorship. The Supreme Court in their impeachable June 2024 unconstitutional decision (Trump v. United States) has decreed that the President’s 'official conduct' (undefined) is immune from criminal prosecution for whatever they do. This 6 to 3 decision already fortifies Trump’s previous determination notoriously declared in July 2019 when he exclaimed 'Then, I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.' And he did just that, violating with impunity federal criminal statutes (See the December 18, 2019, Congressional Record, H-12197), violating the Constitution, defying over 125 Congressional subpoenas, and according to John Bolton his National Security Advisor, making 'obstruction of justice a daily practice in the White House.' Second, Trump has control of Congress with the Republican GOP majority in the House and Senate, however narrow. Congress is thus far showing no sign of resisting his demands for utter submission. House Speaker Mike Johnson has already signaled this abdication of his constitutional duty for checks and balances. Senate Majority Leader Senator John Thune is more circumspect. However mindful he is of the Senate’s constitutional duty of 'advice and consent' regarding Trump’s nominees, Thune has to worry about being overthrown and replaced at any time as Senate Majority Leader by hovering Trump loyalists. Trump wants the Senate to declare a recess for more than ten days to get his team of cabinet and agency nominees appointed without the usual confirmation hearings. This is an extreme demand. As constitutional law specialist, Bruce Fein asserts: 'Such contrived recesses serve no legitimate constitutional purpose. That would make such official acts voidable,' i.e., unenforceable. This illegal escape hatch for Trump is unlikely to materialize for some of his nominees whom the Senate majority will want to reject. Why? Because, for example, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services will be vigorously opposed by Big Pharma, the Big Food Processors, the Health Insurance giants, and the Big Global Warming Polluters (fossil fuels) industries whom he has long criticized and sued when he was an effective environmental lawyer. He doesn’t have much support from Democratic Senators due to his statements about vaccines and their side effects. Guessing, I expect the Senate will turn him down following a conventional nomination hearing. The military-industrial giants will oppose Tulsi Gabbard as Trump’s Director of National Intelligence. She is seen as too extreme a critic, too inexperienced, and likely not to 'get along by going along' with the entrenched national intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA. Trump’s choice for Secretary of Defense, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, a veteran, with no managerial experience, has made harsh statements about military leadership, women, and Muslims. He evinces wanting to go on a vengeance kick and not on a mission to do what Trump has campaigned for, which is ending 'endless wars.' The 47 Democratic Senators are likely to be joined by enough Republican Senators to block his nomination. Trump’s choice of Chris Wright, head of a fracking company and a climate-denier, as Secretary of Energy, will get the full backing of the oil, gas and coal industries leading to an affirmative vote in the Senate. None of these problems bother Trump. Just as was the case with former Representative Matt Gaetz who was forced by disclosures, regarding his sexual aggressions and other negatives, to take himself out of the running nomination for Attorney General, Trump will find plenty of replacements willing to run a Justice Department which lets him do whatever he wants with impunity. At the end of the day, what matters to Trump is getting what he wants. He is warranted in such confidence. Who is going to challenge him? He believes correctly that it will not be the Supreme Court or Congress. The state legislatures will be on the defensive due to his willingness to cut grants and federal contracts to the states, including critical Medicaid services for millions of needy Americans, along with other traditional social safety net programs. The labor unions, worrying about a third of their membership being Trumpsters, among other inhibitions (See, Election Day Delirium by Chris Townsend), are not much of a factor, as they have tethered themselves (with few exceptions) to the Democratic Party bureaucracy. The citizen groups will file their lawsuits and wait for the expected court delays that spell 'Justice delayed is justice denied.' As for the mainstream media CEOs, Trump knows they want higher ratings and more readers so he has given them daily fodder for outrageous epithets, falsehoods, braggadocios and empty promises. In return, media outlets have faithfully published his crazed bloviations. The media has also reported his many corruptions, lies, ignorance of facts, bigotry, sexual escapades, and indictments – to no avail. The MAGA crowd just gets bigger. All the exposés, helped by blunders of prosecutors and partisan Trump judges, have fallen off Teflon Trump like water off a duck’s back. He has procrastinated releasing his full medical history, contrary to his promises in 2016, 2020 and 2024. He has also resisted releasing his tax returns. He now has not complied with ethical reports during the transition from Biden’s regime to his regime. Der Fuhrer Trump believes the rules that his presidential peers have followed do not apply to him. There is a little light at the end of the tunnel. Democratic State Attorneys General will sue and block some of Trump’s violative decisions. Some state prosecutors will go after the burgeoning corruption of Trump’s nominees and their corporate collaborators eager to raid the honey pots of Uncle Sam. But the biggest risk to Trump’s domination will be Trump himself and what damage he will be unleashing that workers, consumers and communities, even those who voted for him, will feel intensely. The assault on their health, safety and economic well-being may weaken Trump’s support. Once people start thinking that MAGA is really MABA (Make America Betrayed Again), the polls should start sliding propitiously from the sky-high expectations of the Paradise that Trump promised every campaign day. At his core, Trump is not all that much different than his worst predecessors. He continued several Bush/Obama wars overseas in his first term, intensifying his backing of war criminal Bibi Netanyahu. He later swallowed his campaign criticism of price-gouging drug companies. And of course, he loves Wall Street, Houston, (the fossil fuel giants), the corporate welfarists, tax escapes of corporate crooks, those who cheat consumers and crush workers’ rights. Remember that is the way he behaved during his former failed business exploits. Nobody stopped him then and he believes the stars of his destiny will not let anyone stop him now. Trump is at his core a corporatist and a corporate statist, who pushes bloated military budgets, lawlessness and police powers, all of which are the frameworks of American fascism. Buckle your seat belts people, and start the civic resurgence. (See my piece, Rise Up: Congress is Yours for the Taking in the new issue of the Capitol Hill Citizen).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnFy6vLuj96nsM	2024-11-24T15:43:05-08:00	
Trump’s Promise: What Ending Global Wars Means For US Defense And...	Donald Trump's recent announcement to end global wars if elected president has sent shockwaves through the American arms industry and international defense circles. This proclamation, while appealing to a war-weary public, raises critical questions about the future of U.S. arms exports, defense spending, and America's role in global security. To understand the potential implications, we must examine the current state of the arms industry, Trump's foreign policy stance, and the complex geopolitical landscape. The Current State of U.S. Arms Exports The United States has long been the world's leading arms exporter, a position that has only strengthened in recent years. In fiscal year 2023, U.S. foreign military sales reached a record high of $80.9 billion, marking a 55% increase from the previous year. This surge was largely driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted many European countries to bolster their defense capabilities. The U.S. government's role in facilitating these sales goes beyond mere profit-seeking. Arms exports are a crucial tool of American foreign policy, allowing the U.S. to strengthen alliances, maintain influence in strategic regions, and shape the global security landscape. The Biden administration has viewed robust arms sales as a means to counter Russian influence and support allies in an increasingly unstable world. Trump's 'End Global Wars' Stance Trump's pledge to end global wars is not entirely new. During his previous term, he often criticized U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts and pushed for a more isolationist approach. However, the specifics of how he plans to achieve this goal remain unclear. It's worth noting that despite his rhetoric, Trump's previous administration oversaw significant arms sales and military operations abroad. His approach to foreign policy was often unpredictable, combining tough talk with a desire for diplomatic breakthroughs Potential Impacts on the Arms Industry If Trump follows through on his pledge to end global wars, it could have several significant impacts on the American arms industry: 1. Reduced Demand: A shift away from interventionist policies could lead to decreased demand for U.S. weapons systems, particularly from countries involved in ongoing conflicts. 2. Shift in Product Focus: The industry might need to pivot towards developing and producing defensive systems rather than offensive weaponry. 3. Domestic Market Emphasis: With potentially reduced foreign sales, arms manufacturers may need to rely more heavily on domestic military contracts. 4. Diversification: Some companies might explore diversifying into non-military sectors to offset potential losses in arms sales. Geopolitical Considerations Trump's stance raises questions about America's role in global security and its commitments to allies. Many U.S. allies, particularly in Europe and Asia, have come to rely on American military support and technology. A sudden withdrawal or significant reduction in U.S. involvement could create power vacuums and potentially embolden adversaries like Russia and China. The situation in Ukraine serves as a prime example of the complexities involved. While Trump has expressed a desire to quickly end the conflict, doing so without considering Ukraine's sovereignty and long-term security could have far-reaching consequences for European stability and America's credibility. Economic Implications The arms industry is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, providing high-skilled jobs and driving technological innovation. Any major shift in policy that affects arms exports could have ripple effects throughout the economy, particularly in regions with a high concentration of defense contractors. However, it's important to note that reduced military spending could potentially free up resources for other sectors, such as infrastructure or renewable energy, which could offset some of the economic impacts. Challenges to Implementation Implementing a policy to 'end global wars' would face several challenges: 1. Congressional Oversight: Major arms sales require congressional approval, and many lawmakers view these sales as crucial for national security and maintaining global influence. 2. Existing Commitments: The U.S. has numerous defense agreements and ongoing operations that cannot be easily or quickly dismantled without significant diplomatic and strategic consequences. 3. Industry Pushback: The powerful defense lobby is likely to resist any policies that could significantly reduce arms sales. 4. Geopolitical Realities: Global conflicts and tensions are often driven by complex factors beyond U.S. control, making it difficult to simply 'end' wars by decree. The Role of Diplomacy Trump's emphasis on ending wars could potentially lead to a greater focus on diplomacy and negotiation. This shift might create opportunities for conflict resolution and peace-building initiatives. However, critics argue that reducing military support for allies could weaken America's bargaining position in diplomatic negotiations. Technological Considerations The arms industry has been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technologies, from artificial intelligence to hypersonic weapons. A significant reduction in military spending or arms exports could potentially slow the pace of innovation in these areas. Conversely, it might also encourage the industry to find civilian applications for military technologies, potentially driving innovation in other sectors. Global Arms Market Dynamics Any major shift in U.S. arms export policy would likely have significant impacts on the global arms market. Other major exporters, such as France, Russia, and China, might seek to fill any void left by reduced U.S. sales. This could lead to a realignment of global arms trade patterns and potentially affect the balance of power in various regions. Domestic Political Considerations Trump's pledge to end global wars may resonate with a public weary of long-term military engagements. However, it could also face opposition from those who view a strong military presence abroad as essential for national security. Donald Trump's pledge to end global wars, if implemented, would mark a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy with far-reaching implications for the American arms industry. While potentially reducing military engagements abroad, such a policy would face numerous challenges and could reshape global security dynamics. The arms industry, which has long been a cornerstone of American economic and strategic power, would need to adapt to a changing landscape. This could involve pivoting towards defensive technologies, exploring new markets, or diversifying into non-military sectors. Ultimately, the fate of the American arms industry under a potential Trump presidency would depend on the specific policies implemented, global geopolitical developments, and the industry's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. As the debate over America's role in the world continues, the arms industry finds itself at a crossroads, facing both challenges and opportunities in an uncertain future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF9RB809r9qnu	2024-11-24T15:41:25-08:00	
Trump ‘Incredibly Concerned’ About Escalation Of Munitions In Rus...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is 'incredibly concerned' about the escalating use of different types of weaponry in Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine, his designated choice for national security adviser said Sunday. Michael Waltz, now a Florida congressman, told 'Fox News Sunday' that the decision by the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use anti-personnel land mines to try to halt Russia’s battlefield ground troop advances has turned the fight in eastern Ukraine into something akin to 'World War I trench warfare.' Waltz said the decision 'needs to be within a broader framework to end this conflict.' 'It is just an absolute meat grinder of people and personnel on that front,' he said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week the United States is sending the anti-personnel mines to Ukraine because of the changing nature of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the main battlefield. He said Russian ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading Moscow’s advance, so Ukraine has 'a need for things that can help slow down that effort.' Waltz said Trump, who takes office January 20, is concerned about the carnage but said that in the broad picture, the question that must be preeminent is, 'How do we restore deterrence and how do we bring peace?' 'We need to, we need to bring this to a responsible end,' he added. Trump has often claimed that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war even before he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president. Trump has never said how and refused to say during a campaign debate in September that he wants Ukraine to win. Biden gave Ukraine authority to launch Washington-supplied missiles with a 300-kilometer range deep into Russia in response to North Korea’s dispatch of 10,000 troops to fight alongside Moscow’s forces. Within two days, Kyiv targeted weapons warehouses in Russia’s Bryansk region with the missiles. Then, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a new experimental rocket, targeting Dnipro in Ukraine’s eastern region. 'This is a clear escalation,' Waltz said. 'Where is this escalation going? How do we get both sides to the table' for peace negotiations? Waltz, whose appointment does not require Senate confirmation, said he has been meeting with Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. Waltz said that any U.S. adversary 'is wrong' if it thinks it can 'play one side off against the other' with the switch in power in Washington from Biden, a Democrat, and his long-time political foe, Trump, a Republican. Waltz said he is 'confident' Trump will restore peace 'in pretty short order' in the multiple conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel fighting Iran-funded militants — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But months of cease-fire talks on the conflict in Gaza are stalemated and talks to reach a halt in the Hezbollah-Israel fighting have yet to produce a deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF5udE0KpbDHJ	2024-11-24T15:39:33-08:00	
Mikati Warns Israeli Military Action In Lebanon A Rejection Of Po...	By Najia Houssari An Israeli strike on a Lebanese army center on Sunday killed a soldier and wounded 18 others, the Lebanese military said, with the caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, calling the attack 'a direct bloody message rejecting all efforts to reach a ceasefire.' The attack came as top EU diplomat Josep Borrell called for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war while on a visit to Lebanon. According to the Lebanese Army Command, the first adjutant, Diab Mohammed Jaafar, was killed when Israel targeted Al-Amariyeh checkpoint on the road between Tyre and the town of Naqoura. In a statement, Mikati said: 'Israel’s messages rejecting a solution are ongoing, and just as it turned against the US-French call for a ceasefire in September, here it is once again responding with Lebanese blood, blatantly rejecting the solution that is being discussed.' He called on 'the countries of the world and the relevant international institutions to assume their responsibilities on the issue.' Mikati’s condemnation came amid growing concerns that the Israeli military is trying to solidify its westward incursion in the coastal town of Al-Bayada, located between Tyre and Naqoura, while facing strong resistance from the eastern side of the border area in its positions in Khiyam. Israeli forces are trying to encircle the South Litani area from both sides. Hezbollah said it 'targeted a gathering of the enemy army s forces east of the city of Khiyam with a salvo of rockets,' and 'a gathering of Israeli forces at the Metula site (Israel’s outlet toward Khiyam) was targeted with a volley of rockets followed by an aerial attack with a squadron of assault drones … hitting its targets accurately.' The Israeli military said Hezbollah launched 160 projectiles toward Israel on Sunday. Sirens sounded across northern and central Israel, reaching Tel Aviv at successive intervals, forcing thousands of Israelis to head toward shelters. Footage from central Israel showed extensive material damage and fires. The Israeli military issued further warnings to residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate, targeting Bourj Al-Barajneh and Hadath. Former Israeli minister Benny Gantz claimed that the Lebanese government 'is leaving Hezbollah unchecked,' adding: 'It is time to act against its assets forcefully.' These developments came during a round of discussions conducted by Borrell, high representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy, in Beirut with Mikati and Speaker Nabih Berry. In a statement, Borrell stressed the need for exerting pressure on Israel and Hezbollah to accept the US proposal for a ceasefire. Borrell emphasized that 'the situation in the Middle East, particularly here in Beirut, presents a significant challenge to the international community. The international community cannot remain inactive in the face of these events. The absence of peace in the Middle East has reached an intolerable level, and people are dying under bombardment.' He added that two months on from his last visit to Beirut, he now views Lebanon as on the verge of collapse due to the conflict, which has led to the devastation of numerous villages, as well as airstrikes aimed at Beirut and Baalbek. He also reiterated that 'the human cost is exceedingly high.' Borrell said Israeli airstrikes had claimed the lives of over 3,500 people in Lebanon, a figure three times greater than the casualties recorded in 2006. The only viable path forward, Borrell said, is an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701. Borrell praised the UNIFIL forces and confirmed the EU’s readiness to allocate &euro;200 million ($208.3 million) to the Lebanese Armed Forces. He emphasized the Lebanese need to 'assume their political responsibilities by electing a president and putting an end to this prolonged power vacuum that has exceeded two years.' Borrell said a ceasefire proposal for Gaza is pending Israeli government approval, and 'we, as the international community, need to work to ensure the respect of international law, as we see famine being used as a weapon of war through international law violations, the complete siege imposed on Gaza and the number of people that are dying in Lebanon.' He added that in his view the decisions of the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, for Israel’s activities in Gaza were not politically motivated and had been made under international law, which applied to everyone. 'We strongly support the court,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF3x9MCMotad2	2024-11-24T15:37:43-08:00	
Austin Bolsters US Cooperation With Fiji, Concludes 12th Trip To ...	By Joseph Clark Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III signed a new agreement Saturday aimed at enhancing the United States' logistics cooperation with Fiji today as he closed out his 12th trip to the Indo-Pacific since taking office. The Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement is aimed at enabling the efficient transfer of fuel and medical supplies and the use of maintenance facilities during emergencies, culminating nearly a decade of negotiations between the two countries and underscoring the United States' commitment to building lasting partnerships throughout the region. 'This agreement will mean closer ties and closer logistics cooperation between our forces, including for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,' Austin said during a press conference. The secretary signed to new agreement alongside Fijian officials during a ceremony today at Black Rock Camp. Ahead of the ceremony, Austin met with Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General Baron Waqa for discussions on bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Fiji. In addition to finalizing the ACSA agreement, the two countries announced the beginning of formal negotiations on a Status of Forces Agreement that will empower the two countries to work more closely together. Austin also announced that the U.S. will provide $4.9 million in foreign military financing for small-arms recapitalization for Fijian forces, pending Congressional approval. Austin said continuing to strengthen the U.S.-Fijian relationship remains as a key focal point in the region. 'Our relationship is rooted in common values and our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,' he said. 'The Indo-Pacific is our priority theater and our partnership with Fiji and other Pacific Island Countries is vital to a free and open Indo-Pacific.' Austin's visit to Fiji, the first by a U.S. defense secretary, caps a series of engagements with regional counterparts showcasing the United States' unwavering commitment to the Indo-Pacific amid what Austin sees as a 'new convergence' of like-minded partners throughout the region. In addition to Fiji, Austin met with key U.S. partners in Australia, the Philippines and Laos in a continuation to the regional momentum he has built throughout his tenure. In Darwin, Australia, Austin met with Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles and Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani Gen as part of the 14th Trilateral Defense Minister's Meeting. In a joint statement following the TDMM, the three leaders announced that Japan will increase its participation in Australia-U.S. force posture cooperation activities, including through annual trilateral amphibious training among the Australian Defense Force, Japan Ground Self Defense Force's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and the U.S. Marine Rotational Force – Darwin. The joint statement also outlines steps to increase intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance cooperation throughout the Indo-Pacific, to include Australia's participation in the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Information Analysis Cell. Following his visit to Darwin, Austin proceeded to the Philippines where he met with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. and Philippine Secretary of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro. While there, Austin and Teodoro attended an official signing ceremony for the newly established General Security of Military Information Agreement, that provides a legal framework enabling enhanced and expanded sharing of information and defense technology between the two countries. The agreement serves as a foundation for further enhancing interoperability between U.S. and Philippine forces and paves the way for additional security agreements in the future. Austin and Teodoro also broke ground on a new combined coordination center at Camp Aguinaldo in Manila to further enable information sharing between U.S. and Philippine forces. Later, Austin met with Marcos at Malacanang Palace in Manila where the secretary further underscored the strong ties between the two countries. Before departing the Philippines, Austin observed a Philippine Navy technical demonstration showcasing T-12 unmanned surface vessels provided by the U.S. through foreign military financing. The T-12 is a key capability used by Philippine forces to protect its sovereignty and operate throughout its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. Austin's stop in the Philippines was his fourth visit to the country since taking office, the most visits ever by a U.S. secretary of defense. In Laos, Austin attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus. U.S. defense secretaries have participated in the forum since 2010 when it was established by the 10-member block of Southeast Asian nations. Austin met with a range of regional allies and partners on during the forum and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to regional security. He also announced the first-ever U.S. Defense Department vision statement for a prosperous and secure Southeast Asia. The statement outlines the U.S. vision for deepening our practical cooperation across Southeast Asia. Austin also announced during the two-day series of engagements that ASEAN member states approved a second iteration of a U.S.-led maritime exercise with ASEAN countries, which was first held in 2019. 'We've been focused on working with countries, like minded countries to promote an open and secure Indo-Pacific region where countries can protect their interests and also feel free to sail international waterways and fly international skies wherever international law will allow,' Austin said today in discussing his most recent trip to the Indo-Pacific and, more broadly, the United States' progress over the past four years in strengthening ties throughout the region. 'We've accomplished a great deal,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdjxeylJKFnF18i5kwdxT2n	2024-11-24T15:36:26-08:00

Maldives Embraces India Fully, Disengaging From China – Analysis	An Indo-Maldivian Comprehensive Economic and Defence Partnership Agreement is on the cards. Maldives was ardently pro-China from 2013 to 2018 during the Presidency of Abdulla Yameen. But it swung completely to the Indian side when Ibrahim Solih replaced Yameen. However, when Yameen's protégé, Mohamed Muizzu, won the Presidential election in 2023, he gave every indication of a swing back to China. But things turned topsy-turvy when India asserted itself strongly and balanced it by granting much-needed financial assistance to Maldives at a time when China offered no help, Muizzu buried the hatchet and embraced India wholeheartedly. With India and Maldives getting closer by the day, the two countries are aiming at signing a Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership Agreement (CEMSPA). During the meeting between the Maldivian President Dr.Mohamed Muizzzu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on October 7, the leaders acknowledged that it was an opportune time for both sides to chart a new framework for cooperation with an aim to comprehensively transform the bilateral relationship to a 'Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership' which is people-centric and future-oriented and be an anchor of stability in the Indian Ocean Region. The latest in the series of Indo-Maldivian agreement was the MOU signed in New Delhi between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Maldivian Monetary Authority (MMA) to allow the use of the Maldivian Rufiyya and the Indian Rupee in Maldives-India trade. Indo-Maldivian bilateral trade is of the order of US$ 485 million. Between August 2023 and August 2024 the exports of India increased by US$ 41.7 million (104%) from S$ 40 million US$ 81.7 million, while imports increased by US$ 7.48 million (30.8%) from US$ 24.3 million to US$ 31.8 million. Uses of Local Currencies Trade The framework envisaged by the RBI-MMA MOU will enable exporters and importers to invoice and settle in their respective domestic currencies, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of trading in the INR-MVR pair in the foreign exchange market. The use of local currencies will optimise costs and reduce settlement time for transactions, the RBI said in a statement. 'The MoU encourages the use of INR and MVR in current account transactions, permissible capital account transactions, and any other economic and financial transactions as agreed upon by both countries,' an RBI statement said. The costs of the dependence on currencies outside of the region for the settlement of trade in the region results in cost for changing currencies for trade settlement; the instability in export prices in response to exchange rate changes and costs of hedging exchange rate risks. In contrast, the merits of using the local currencies for trade settlement reveals encouraging efficiency in trade and investment transactions; lowering the above mentioned costs; enhancing export competitiveness arising from cost effectiveness; and promoting trade and investment at the firm, country and regional levels. The RBI-MMA agreement will allow businesses in both countries to invoice and settle transactions in their respective domestic currencies, with the framework aiming to facilitate trading in the Maldivian Rufiyaa and Indian Rupee (MVR-INR) currency pair within the foreign exchange market, the Maldives' central bank said. The arrangement will enable businesses in both markets to pay for the import and export of goods and services with their local currencies. The use of local currencies would also reduce costs and improve settlement times, the MMA highlighted. 'This MoU is a significant step forward in enhancing trade and financial ties between the Maldives and India. By enabling the use of local currencies for bilateral transactions, it will strengthen economic cooperation, promote trade, and foster closer financial integration between the two countries,' the MMA said in a statement 'This collaboration marks a key milestone in strengthening bilateral cooperation between the RBI and MMA,' the RBI added, noting that the use of local currencies in bilateral transactions will eventually contribute to promoting trade between India and Maldives, deepen financial integration, and strengthen economic relations between the two countries. Growing Ties During President Muizzu's visit to New Delh in October, the two countries signed a bilateral currency swap agreement enabling the Maldives' central bank to draw a swap facility under two windows; a USD/EUR window and an INR window, respectively, against the MVR. The swap facility would allow the MMA to make multiple drawals up to a maximum limit of US$400 million in addition to INR 30 billion, within the existing 'Framework on Currency Swap Arrangement for SAARC Countries, 2024-2027'. The USD/EUR swap facility is aimed at supporting the Maldives' foreign exchange liquidity requirements, while the INR swap facility would allow trade settlement in local currencies. The Maldivian President thanked India for its timely emergency financial assistance, including by way of rolling over Treasury-bills subscribed by the State Bank of India amounting to USD 100 million in May and September 2024 for a further period of one year that provided the much needed financial cushion for Maldives in addressing its urgent financing needs. He expressed appreciation for the decision of the Government of India to extend support in the form of USD 400 million and INR 30 billion as a bilateral currency swap agreement, instrumental in tackling the ongoing financial challenges faced by the Maldives. India has agreed to extend full support for the timely completion of the flagship Greater Malé Connectivity Project (GMCP), and to undertake a feasibility study to connect the islands of Thilafushi and Giraavaru as an extension. The two leaders also agreed to develop a state-of-the-art commercial port at Thilafushi island in order to de-congest the Malé port and provide enhanced cargo handling capacity at Thilafushi. The two countries have decided to explore collaboration for development of transshipment facilities and bunkering services contributing towards Maldives Economic Gateway project at Ihavandhippolhu and Gaadhoo islands of Maldives; and to jointly work in harnessing the full potential of Hanimaadhoo and Gan airports that are being developed with Indian assistance as well as other airports of Maldives. Towards this end, both sides will also consider measures to strengthen air connectivity, attract investments and collaborate for efficient management of these airports. Modi and Muizzu decided to establish an 'Agriculture Economic Zone' and tourism investments in Haa Dhaalu atoll and fish processing and canning facility at Haa Alifu atoll with Indian assistance and to further expand through additional financing the successful High Impact Community Development Projects to take the India-Maldives people-centric development partnership to every part of Maldives. FTA In view of significant untapped potential for bilateral trade & investment, the two sides agreed to initiate discussions on a Bilateral Free Trade Agreement focusing on trade in goods and services between the two countries and to promote bilateral investments and closer engagements between the two business chambers and entities; steps shall be taken for disseminating information relating to investment opportunities and to improve ease of doing business; A decision was also taken to enhance efforts to boost tourism between the two countries through marketing campaigns and collaborative efforts and share expertise on implementation of digital and financial services. In this context, there was a decision to cooperate in the domain of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) by launch of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Unique Digital Identity, Gati Shakti Scheme and other digital services that will enhance e-governance and delivery of services through digital domain for the benefit of people of Maldives. While welcoming the launch of RuPay card in Maldives, which will enhance ease of payments for Indian tourists visiting Maldives, the two countries decided to work closely to extend similar services for Maldivian nationals visiting India. Energy Cooperation Given the role of energy security in ensuring sustainable development, the two sides agreed to explore cooperation through implementation of solar power and other renewable energy and energy efficiency projects to bring down energy costs and enable Maldives to achieve its NDC Goals, both sides will establish a framework for an institutional partnership which will include training, exchange of visits, joint research, technical projects and promotion of investments. Towards this end, both sides will also undertake a feasibility study to identify measures that would enable Maldives to participate in the One Sun One World One Grid initiative. Defence & Security Cooperation India and Maldives share common challenges in the Indian Ocean Region which have multi-dimensional implications for the security and development of both the countries. They resolved to work together in advancing the maritime and security cooperation for the benefit of peoples of both India and Maldives as well as for the larger Indian Ocean Region. Maldives, with its vast Exclusive Economic Zone, is exposed to traditional and non-traditional maritime challenges including piracy, IUU fishing, drug smuggling, and terrorism. The two countries agreed that India will work closely with Maldives in sharing of expertise, augmenting capabilities and undertake joint cooperative measures, as per needs and requirements of Maldives. The also agreed that the ongoing Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) 'Ekatha' harbour project at Uthuru Thila Falhu (UTF) with India's assistance will significantly contribute towards enhancing MNDF's operational capabilities, and agreed to extend full support for its timely completion. The two sides also agreed to support Maldives with provisioning of defence platforms and assets to augment capabilities of MNDF as well as that of the Government of Maldives in advancing its maritime and security requirements in line with its national priorities; India will support Maldives in enhancing surveillance and monitoring capability of MNDF with the provisioning of radar systems and other equipment. India will also support Maldives on Hydrographic matters, including, through capacity building and training, as per the requirements of the Government of Maldives. India will assist Maldives in the domain of Information Sharing by supporting the development of capabilities through infrastructure, training and sharing of best practices. It will inaugurate at an early date the state-of-the-art Maldivian Ministry of Defence (MoD) building in Malé, constructed with India's assistance, that will augment modern infrastructural capacity of the MoD.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EGX59dic3WUj	2024-11-23T17:27:28-08:00	
What Lies Ahead: Understanding Trump’s Return To Power – Analysis	By Manoj Joshi Donald Trump’s victory will lead to major changes in almost all policy areas in the United States (US), from tariffs and immigration to the Ukraine war. How they will be prioritised is another matter. Characteristically, Trump also appears to grapple with personal challenges, including a strong inclination to address perceived or actual slights and instances of perceived persecution. The coming Trump era could well be the most unpredictable and disruptive in our times. His appointments indicate that he intends to fulfil his election pledges, especially on immigration. Beyond policy and personal foibles, the US elections hold immense significance. Till now, the first Trump presidency has often been viewed as an aberration and the Biden term as the norm. Now, however, it is the latter which seems to be a discontinuity. The second Trump term, which has been an all-round victory for the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) forces, will now be the norm for the US in the near future. The Trump win was not a defeat of liberalism, with its emphasis on individual rights, the rule of law, and constitutional checks on the state. It was one for neo-liberalism, which pushed globalism, abandoned the working class, and emphasised money-making over everything else. The American working class was wiped out as manufacturing relocated to Asia. Instead of their plight, neoliberal Democrats focused on narrower strands of the deprived—racial minorities, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and so on. As deprived people, they were often given a leg up, even as the original working class sank and became increasingly susceptible to the appeal of MAGA politics. While this originally attracted the white working class, Trump succeeded in getting the support of the Black and Latino working class as well. Many people think that Trumpism will be a self-limiting disease. That the impossibility of achieving the contradictory set of objectives it has set for itself will temper Trump’s impact. For instance, take the issue of tariffs. Trump said last month, 'tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.' Most economists agreed that 10-20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports tariffs will raise prices in the US. There is a school of thought which believes that enacting tariffs will be a negotiating tactic, and nothing more. If this is so, there are two possible outcomes—other countries will lower their trade barriers, or, the more likely outcome, retaliate with their own tariffs. This will lead to an inflationary situation, something that Trump should know proved to be poison for the Democrats in this election. The big target is Mexico. Trump has declared that he will raise tariffs 200 or 500 percent: 'I don’t care. I’ll put a number where they can’t sell one car' (in the US). Currently, Mexico is the US’ biggest trade partner and has sold 2.55 million cars in the US in 2023. Tariffs would hit companies like Honda, Toyota, and Volkswagen, but it would also affect American companies like Ford, General Motors (GM), and Stellantis, whose supply chains extend to Mexico, while also using the country as a manufacturing base. For Mexico, it will be a double whammy, since the largest number of undocumented migrants to be deported are from the same country. With regards to immigration, Trump wants to close the border and begin the process of deporting up to 11 million undocumented migrants. He has appointed hard-liners Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan to undertake this task, signalling his intention of fulfilling his campaign promises. This is no ordinary task as this community is now woven into the US’ social and economic fabric. Vice President J. D. Vance has said that the target is to deport some 1 million illegal immigrants per year. Prising them out, setting up detention centres, overcoming legal challenges and encouraging them to return to their homelands could take years. It will also affect the economy since migrants are the backbone of agriculture and construction industries, and their presence has helped keep wages in check. A deportation process is likely to lead to inflation. In many of these areas, the real question is what Trump will decide to focus on. Apparently, there are no less than 40 agendas he has promised to begin pursuing from his first day in office. Definitely, avenging himself against those he says have persecuted him in the Biden administration will be a priority. Among the targeted persons could be Jack Smith, former Attorney General Merrick Garland, as well as Trump’s friends-turned-enemies such as John Kelly, former Joint Chief of Staff, Chairman General Mark Milley, and Liz Cheney. Another strand of his policy will be a change in the rules to allow the firing of any federal official. There could be large-scale firings, accompanied by the appointment of MAGA supportors in their positions. Foreign policy is an area that will experience a big change. The likely appointment of Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State signals a hardline approach. Rubio is known for his hawkish positions on Iran, China, and Venezuela, as well as his support for Israel’s campaign in Gaza. Ukraine is likely to be a big loser, though the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) could also find itself in crosshairs. Both the US and European Union (EU) short-changed the Ukrainians in the last two years through their niggling weapons supply policies. Now Ukraine may be forced to cede territory to achieve peace, even while NATO’s status hangs in the air. JD Vance has suggested that the aim would be to have Russia and Ukraine ceasefire along the current frontlines, which means a loss of around 18 percent of Ukrainian territory that Russia has occupied since 2022. The Vance plan would also guarantee Ukrainian neutrality towards Russia. As for Israel, Trump will be more supportive of Israeli military activities and would not, like the Biden Administration, use US military assistance as leverage to push Israeli policy in any specific direction. According to the Times of Israel, Trump has told Netanyahu that he wants an end to the Gaza war by the time he takes office on 20 January 2025. But there are other issues where the US position will benefit Israel as well—particularly, destroying Hezbollah in Lebanon and dealing with Iran. Trump had walked away from the nuclear deal with Tehran and begun a campaign of 'maximum pressure,' with harsh sanctions to push Iran to end its nuclear programme and its policy of arming regional proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. There is a lot of talk about Trump’s hardline views on China. But people often forget that in January 2020, he willingly signed a trade deal with China. There is no reason to believe that another such deal could not take place and also include the status of Taiwan also in it. America is in trouble. Its polarisation has deepened with this election and Trump’s attacks on the government have weakened the important infrastructure of American power. There is little doubt that the West-led multilateral world order that was put in place after World War II is headed for a change. It has been showing strain for some time now, but the MAGA victory could have sounded the death knell. The UN Security Council (SC) is more or less frozen with the divisions between Russia, China, and the West. As for the World Trade Organization (WTO), Trump has ensured that its appellate function was torpedoed in 2016, and now, with a tariff war around the corner, there is little chance that it will be able to do anything about that. The Biden administration had strongly backed NATO and America’s East Asian allies—Japan, South Korea, Philippines and Australia. In the case of NATO, Trump has questioned whether the US would honour the alliance’s mutual defence clause and has actually suggested that he would encourage Russia to 'to do whatever the hell they want' to any NATO country that doesn’t pay enough. All this is not necessarily bad. Countries of the Global South could benefit from the US’ retreat from its dominant role in world affairs. The new multilateralism fostered by organisations like BRICS could reshape the world to better serve Indian interests. But this is no ordinary task, this new multilateralism will have to go beyond its penchant for declarations and deliver results on the ground.

China’s Increasing Global Drone Footprint – Analysis	By Abhishek Kumar Darbey China has established the world’ largest Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) industry. It has become the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs, with its signature models—the Wing Loong and Rainbow Series UAV.1 According to the SIPRI Arms Transfer Database, between 2008 and 2018, China exported a total of 181 fighter/combat drones and 163 strike-capable UAVs. The UAE (22 per cent), Saudi Arabia (19 per cent), Egypt (15 per cent) and Pakistan (14 per cent) have been the most significant recipients of Chinese drones, during this time period.2 According to the SIPRI, China has delivered more than 200 combat drones to 17 countries in the period 2013–2023.3 Chinese Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) have been used on battlefields in the Middle East and Africa. For instance, the Nigerian Air Force has been using CH-3 fighter drone in operations against Boko Haram, and Saudi Arabia has used Wing Loong II drones in the war against Houthi militias in Yemen. Egypt uses Wing Loong-II fighter drones against militant groups in north Sinai.4 In Iraq, Chinese combat drones carried out 260 air raids against ISIL (ISIS) targets as of mid-2018, with a success rate of nearly 100 per cent.5 Iraq had purchased four CH-4B Rainbow fighter drones in 2015. Saudi Arabia has been one of the oldest and regular customers of Chinese drones, and has imported 70 Chinese combat drones. Saudi Arabia first purchased a few CH-4 drones in 2014 and has since acquired at least 15 of the more lethal Wing Loong II drones, with an expressed interest to buy 285 more. China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) has set up a drone manufacturing unit in Saudi Arabia after the agreement was reached between Xi Jinping and King Salman in February 2017. The state-owned Saudi Technology Development and Investment Company (TAQNIA) and CASC subsidiary Aerospace Long-March International Trade (ALIT) have worked on establishing this manufacturing unit. Abu Dhabi was the first export customer for the Wing Loong II drones, and received the first units in 2017.6 Similarly, China sold at least five Wing Loong I drones to UAE in 2011. In early 2017, the UAE purchased five Wing Loong II fighter drones. The Pakistani Air Force purchased five CH-4 Rainbow combat drones in January 2021,7 and in May 2024, Pakistan ordered 10 more CH-4 Rainbow-series of combat drones at around US$ 24 million.8 In 2013, Myanmar purchased 12 CH-3 fighter drones.9 The Serbian military has purchased CH-92A Reconnaissance/Attack drones worth US$ 19.3 million in June 2020.10 Chinese drones are cheaper than their Western counterparts, and therefore, are more appealing to those countries with limitations of budget. The CH-4 and the Wing Loong 2 are estimated to cost between US$ 1 m and US$ 2 m each, while the US-made Reaper costs US$ 16m and the Predator US$ 4m, according to CSIS, the US-based think tank. China also offers flexible payment terms to interested buyers, and many African buyers pay the amount in terms of oil and other natural resources.11 China is able to keep pace with the market demands of military drones in terms of innovation and quality, as regards flight control, integrated navigation, relay data link system, sensor technology, among others.12[xii] China has successfully developed dozens of new generation military unmanned aerial vehicles, models and prototypes, including stealth unmanned aerial vehicles, foldable wing unmanned aerial vehicles, short-distance take-off and landing ring-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, micro unmanned aerial vehicles and flying wing unmanned aerial vehicles.13 In order to increase its market share, China is investing to upgrade its drone manufacturing units. In late 2021, Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group (Chengfei), a subsidiary of China Aviation Industry Corporation, signed an agreement with the Zigong Municipal Government of Sichuan to jointly build ‘the largest domestic UAV industrial base (无人机工业园区)’ worth 10 billion Yuan (US$ 1.55 billion) to manufacture military and commercial UAVs. It got operationalised in 2023.14 PLA and Military Uses of Drones China has a number of UAVs in service with the PLA Rocket Force, PLA Ground Force/Army, PLA Air Force and PLA Navy.15 The PLA is currently equipped with several long-endurance reconnaissance and strike drones. For example, the PLA Air Force’s drone brigade uses the Wing Loong-2 (GJ-2) drone, and the PLA Army uses Rainbow-4 reconnaissance and strike drone. According to Chinese media reports, the PLA Army has begun using KVD002 medium-altitude long-flight reconnaissance and strike drone at the theatre command and group army levels, unveiled in September 2023.16 The TB-001 drone is not just a reconnaissance and strike drone, but can be used along with the PLA Rocket Force’s anti-ship ballistic missiles.17 In August 2021, the China Central Television (CCTV) disclosed that the PLA Rocket Force had mastered the ability to accurately hit large mobile ships thousands of kilometers away at sea by guiding the DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles. China has improved its applications of drone for patrolling its land borders as well as coastlines, and particularly along the Sino-Indian border and Taiwan Strait. PLA’s UAV troops have been deployed in large numbers in the Western Theatre Command. At present, PLA has deployed ‘GJ-2’ drones and ‘Rainbow-4’ drones in the Western Theatre Command for reconnaissance activities along the borders. In 2019, the AV500W reconnaissance and strike integrated helicopter was also deployed on the Tibetan plateau. This unmanned helicopter weighs 450 kilograms and has a ceiling of 6,700 meters. It can carry four small laser-guided air-to-surface missiles to accurately strike enemy personnel and light vehicles.18 Similarly, China has been using its drones to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance activities in the East China Sea, Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Japan and Taiwan reported Chinese drone patrols over their claimed waters. In May 2024, the Japanese Ministry of Defense reported that the WZ-10 UAV flew over the East China Sea and approached Japan.19 PLA used the BZK-005 and TB-001 drones to fly into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. Both drones have reconnaissance and attack capabilities. The BZK-005 is a large multi-purpose drone with a maximum endurance of 40 hours, and its cruising altitude is 3,000 to 7,000 meters.20 Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed on 25 August 2023 that two Chinese drones flew around Taiwan for nearly 24 hours. The two Chinese drones identified were reconnaissance/attack drone ‘TB001’ and the reconnaissance drone ‘BZK005’.21 In August 2024, a Wing Loong 10 was seen flying along the Vietnamese coastline to the southern city of Nha Trang.22 In recent times, China has entered into foreign collaborations to develop military drones. On 25 September, Reuters reported that Russian UAV company IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned arms company Almaz-Antey, is working with Chinese specialists to develop a new drone model called Garpiya-3 (G3), which is a 2,000 km range attack drone. Another Russian firm Redlepus TSK Vector Industrial has set up 80-hectare ‘Advanced UAV Research and Manufacturing Base’ in Shenzhen in China that would be able to produce 800 long-range attack drones per year, similar to G3 attack drones. 23 Conclusion The Chinese military is gradually being equipped with drones of increasing lethality and capabilities. Chinese defence universities have special programmes to train PLA soldiers majoring in drone technology and applications. Chinese drone manufacturers such as DJI have captured a significant chunk of global civilian drone market. According to the 2023–2024 China Drone Development Report released by the China Air Transport Association, as of the end of August 2024, nearly 2 million drones were registered in China, an increase of 720,000 from the end of 2023. By 2025, the output of China’s civilian drones is expected to exceed 200 billion yuan.24 Chinese military drones, meanwhile, are widely being used in conflict hotspots across the world, particularly so in Africa and the Middle East. The PLA has intensified the military drones R&D as well as manufacturing activities. Going forward, the global footprint of Chinese military as well as civilian drone programmes is only expected to grow exponentially.

Germany At A Crossroads: Coalition Breakdown Portends Sweeping Ch...	By Melanie Banerjee On November 6, shortly after the results of the 2024 US elections became clear, Germany was plunged into political uncertainty when Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a confidence vote for January 2025. Given the flagging popularity of the coalition government, the confidence vote is likely to result in snap elections in February, well ahead of the expected date of September 2025. The catalyst for these events traces back to a leaked policy position paper from Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), which proposed policies in stark contrast to the FDP’s coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens. The paper, titled Economic Transition for Germany: Economic Concepts for Growth and Intergenerational Fairness, contradicts and negates key aspects of coalition policy, including climate action, social security, taxation, and Germany’s Sonderweg thesis (the ‘unique path’). The disclosure effectively fractured the coalition, with Chancellor Scholz dismissing FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leaving the SPD and Greens to rule in as a minority government. Now evidently heading into early elections, the question arises: How will Germany’s economic transformation be impacted if these ideas are given central political consideration? Let’s examine. A Challenge to Germany’s Top-down Welfare State Germany takes pride in its socialist politics, which became a touchstone for modern Germany following the world wars, and whose emergence broadly shaped the German political economy of the 19th century before paving the way from aristocracy to democracy. These politics have been influenced by the Sonderweg thesis, which asserts the importance of German exceptionalism in the West. This school of thought believes in democracy and social reforms as a top-down approach, wherein the state is responsible for initiating and implementing reforms without demands ‘from below.’ In this context, for example, the German government drafted an enactment in May aimed at stabilizing pension levels and creating a generational capital fund for the Statutory Pension Insurance System. The leaked policy paper from Finance Minister Christian Lindner argues against this top-down welfare model, stating that it is unsustainable from a budgetary perspective and exhibits anti-emancipatory characteristics that burden future generations. He also supported the debt brake (Schuldenbremse), a provision in the German Constitution (Basic Law) that limits government spending when potential revenues are insufficient. Lindner has described the rising costs of an ageing population as an intergenerational injustice that negatively impacts national finances. Various academics and policymakers have roundly criticized Lindner’s stance. The full impact of this policy shift won’t become apparent until the 2025 elections have run their course. But by risking concessions to Germany’s elderly population, in the context of a stagnant workforce and income levels, there is a growing opportunity for the rise of neo-Marxist ideals, which view retirees as rent-seekers, further exacerbating economic imbalances. Moreover, this assumption implicitly regards pensions as passive income, without considering factors such as investment expenses, income taxes on returns, personal spending, or charitable contributions. An obstinate focus on combining growth parameters with medium- and long-term political strategies, without factoring in economic consumption as part of the rate of capital or wealth growth, risks jeopardizing the future of the federal German economy. This approach may foster the belief that pensioners are not active participants in the economy, leading to the misguided notion that the growth rate of wealth is negative. Climate Policies on the Chopping Block The latest draft of Germany’s 2025 budget prioritized commitments to address negative climate impacts on the economy, allotting special funds to trigger the clean energy transition, especially in sectors such as affordable housing, supply chains, and EV charging. However, Finance Minister Christian Lindner has increasingly referred to Germany’s budget position on the Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF), adopted by the federal government in August 2024, as ‘politically enforced decarbonization,’ arguing that it is a leading cause of capital shocks to public finances, resulting in sluggish investments. Despite ongoing legislative proceedings that are expected to finalize the fund’s implementation by 2025, Lindner’s policy position does not address the constitutional mandate to re-draft the 2024 budget, following the Constitutional Court’s ruling on the debt limit in November 2023. The dissolution of the ruling coalition is likely to cast a shadow over the future of German climate policy, risking increased bureaucratic pressure and negative consequences for the implementation of the KTF. Furthermore, any bureaucratic delays in meeting Germany’s 2045 emissions targets will complicate the country’s industrial transition to renewable energy. Despite mounting pressures, Lindner has overlooked the position of Germany’s farming sector, which will be one of the most affected by these developments. The sector is already grappling with hyperinflation due to rising national CO2 emissions pricing, which also impacts transportation and heating. According to the DG Agriculture and Rural Development’s 2nd Report (EU Commission, Spring 2024), Germany was ranked among the top three Western European countries unable to afford a proper meal in 2022, surpassing the EU average. Additionally, the latest Global Food Security Index of 2022, published by Economist Impact, places Germany in the red for food security and access, ranking it 80th globally—among the lowest in high-income countries. The negative rating is attributed to a lack of a comprehensive food security strategy and agency, with no improvement since 2012. The collapse of the Traffic Light coalition has paved the way for a rise in pro-corporate political approaches in the upcoming snap elections of 2025, likely accompanied by demands for public budget allocations for subsidies and tax cuts. With German industries already struggling with fierce competition from Asian markets, a shock stimulus to boost industrial competitiveness could undermine medium-term growth potential and exacerbate existing economic imbalances. Public Versus Private Lindner’s policy recommendations have taken broad swipes at the ruling government’s regulatory standards, advocating for a series of corporate tax cuts and the abolition of solidarity surcharges (Solidaritätszuschlag or Soli) on SMEs and freelance workers, all in the name of boosting innovation and competition. While the recommendations may appear well-intentioned, the former finance minister seems intent on sacrificing the public sector and marginalized groups. Taken together, these proposals reflect a steadfast rejection of German budgetary sustainability, which is crucial in the current economic climate. The assumption that corporate tax cuts, facilitated by reduced public services, will eventually pay for themselves through future growth is, to put it mildly, flawed. Not only do these policy measures threaten to undermine public services in the long term, but they also risk destabilizing inflationary pressures in the short term, leading to economic turmoil. No Turning Back Given the present conditions, one might assume that Germany needs to transition into economic nationalism to preserve the prospects of the Sonderweg and its political economy. Ex-Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s position paper asserts intergenerational injustice as a leading consequence of Germany’s economic downturn. However, the turmoil within the current German administration following the finance minister’s policy recommendations has overlooked the positive aspects of internationalism that have positioned post-war Germany as a global leader. Moreover, with mobility, migration, and international trade at the center of Germany’s political triangulations, the position paper’s failure to address outward mobility, diasporic contributions, and social values that disfavor trade protectionism as a decisive factor in social renewal to sustain the German Sonderweg presents an exclusionary narrative. This risks threatening Germany’s position as a major economic bulwark in the Global North. If anything, Germany’s national growth owes its enormous economic profitability to the international division of labor. Although the post-pandemic economic struggles affecting the German working class are no trivial matter, Germany’s emotionally charged political debates about the values of German work (Deutsche Arbeit) are unfair in spirit, pitting the country’s crisis consciousness against the depoliticization of socio-political institutions. Among Ordoliberals such as Lindner, there exists a perception of the economy as an isolated order, one where results are a direct outcome of influence on the systemic order rather than on the processes themselves. This enables the scope of economic short-termism, devoid of future sustainability. For now, Germany’s political uncertainty illustrates demands for minimal state interventionism to stabilize the economy in the long term. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the theoretical currents of such economic liberalism in post-pandemic Germany will translate into a classical problem of secondary deflation or create a decentralized competitive order that paves the way for institutional integrity toward social reunification.

Iran’s Regime Reacts To IAEA Resolution Against Its Nuclear Progr...	On November 21, 2024, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors adopted a resolution condemning Iran’s regime for its lack of cooperation with the agency and provide a comprehensive report on its nuclear activities. This resolution, proposed by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the United States, was approved with 19 votes in favor, 3 against, and 12 abstentions In an effort to prevent the adoption of the resolution, which could activate snapback sanctions, Iran’s mobilized all available lobbying resources. Despite these efforts, the major European powers ultimately introduced the resolution, which was then approved by the Board of Governors. According to The New York Times, Abbas Araghchi, the regime’s foreign minister, contacted officials from member states of the Board of Governors, including Brazil, South Africa, Bangladesh, Algeria, Burkina Faso, and Pakistan, asking them to oppose the resolution. Alongside Araghchi’s lobbying and pressuring of Board of Governors’ member states via phone calls from Tehran and efforts in Vienna, Iranian officials and media issued a series of threats during and after a visit by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi to Tehran, warning of severe retaliatory actions should a resolution be adopted. However, after the blow of the Board of Governors’ resolution, Iran’s Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organization issued a joint, fearful statement declaring their readiness for 'constructive engagement with relevant parties' in the 'development of a peaceful and indigenous nuclear program.' The weak joint statement claimed that the administration of Masoud Pezeshkian had prioritized continuing and enhancing cooperation with the IAEA since its inception to resolve outstanding issues. This stance contradicts earlier declarations by officials from these same institutions, who had stated that any resolution by the Board of Governors would signal the end of cooperation, mark the start of confrontation, and be intolerable. They had also threatened an immediate, severe, and 'regret-inducing' response if such a resolution were adopted. A state-affiliated media outlet, under the headline 'Iran Will Respond to the Counterproductive Actions of the Board of Governors,' wrote: '[Mohammad] Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, emphasized Iran’s cooperation with the IAEA but announced that if a resolution is adopted against Iran at the next IAEA meeting, Tehran will begin new nuclear measures even before the resolution’s adoption. Iran’s Foreign Minister also stressed this point in diplomatic terms.' Hassan Ghashghavi, the head of the nuclear committee of the regime’s Majlis (parliament), had explicitly stated before the resolution’s issuance: 'If a resolution is prepared against our country by the IAEA Board of Governors, we will undoubtedly and immediately take measures that will definitely be regret-inducing.' Following the weak joint statement by the Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organization, Kazem Gharibabadi, the regime’s deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs, issued an unconvincing threat, delaying the 'immediate and regret-inducing response' until after the snapback sanctions are reinstated. He stated: 'If they revert to the snapback mechanism and reinstate UN Security Council sanctions, the Islamic Republic will respond swiftly by withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).' More absurdly, Gharibabadi foolishly added: 'This is a decision that the state made several years ago and has officially communicated to them in writing.' (State television, November 21, 2024). Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, the former head of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Majlis, attributed the regime’s weak and anxious response to the resolution’s impact as follows: 'The IAEA resolution was the first sign of a harsh winter for Iran. Europe has aligned itself with Trump’s maximum pressure campaign. They are demanding the rollback of nuclear activities and programs and the increase of inspections without offering any concessions.' Reuters reported on the consequences of the IAEA Board of Governors’ resolution, stating that it compels the regime to cooperate with the IAEA. The Western powers behind the resolution intend to pressure the regime into negotiating new restrictions on its nuclear activities. However, it remains unclear whether the regime or its counterparts have the appetite or intention for another round of talks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EO6mFSNniVz8	2024-11-23T16:45:11-08:00	
Disparate Impact Is A Legal Trick – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya One of the most destructive fallacies of critical race theory is its insistence that racial disparities are caused by discrimination. The CRT premise is that any gap in racial attainment calls for an explanation, and—in the absence of any convincing explanation—they are compelled to conclude that such gaps are caused by discrimination. Many readers will be familiar with Thomas Sowell’s refutation of that argument. In arguing that disparities do not prove discrimination, Sowell challenges the premise that, in the absence of discrimination, we should expect all human beings to have equal life opportunities, experiences, and outcomes. In his book, Disparities and Discrimination Sowell 'argues that there is an underlying assumption that if discrimination was absent equality would prevail, which historically has been proven wrong.' It is wrong to expect equal attainment from human beings—people have different skills, abilities, and talents, so we would have no reason to expect that, if they are all given an 'equal' starting point, they would all exhibit uniform and equal levels of attainment. The gap between black and white The civil rights industry is founded on the debunked premise that disparities are prima facie evidence of discrimination. A large part of civil rights enforcement is now devoted to collecting statistics which will reveal attainment 'gaps.' These gaps are then treated as presumptive evidence of discrimination which, at the very least, will merit an investigation from what Lew Rockwell called 'the anti-discrimination police'—the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. Collecting data on race with a view to exposing attainment gaps is a well-funded industry. For example, in the context of educational attainment, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights had a budget of $178 million in 2024. Civil rights activists feel this is not enough to monitor all the gaps, and are requesting that the budget should be doubled: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States, and the 91 undersigned organizations, we urge you to double the funding for the U.S. Department of Education’s ('the department') Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to $280 million in your FY2025 request to Congress. The Leadership Conference appreciated the $178 million requested for FY2024; however, this vital office, central to the function of the department as a whole, has been sorely underfunded for far too long. The Civil Rights Data Collection office of the DOE aims 'to ensure CRDC data is an accurate and comprehensive depiction of student access to educational opportunities.' They also collect 'data on access to and enrollment in mathematics and science classes,' which can be used to demonstrate a racial 'gap' in children’s 'educational opportunities' in the sciences. Making an effort preemptively to avoid having statistics that reflect a racial gap can help schools avoid costly investigations from the anti-discrimination police. This explains why, to avoid their statistics showing a racial gap in mathematics, some schools have decreed that in 'antiracist math practice' there are no 'correct' answers to mathematical problems. That way all the children’s sums can be marked by teachers as correct and voila—no statistical gap! By this means they propose to eradicate 'inequity in math': Educators around the country have come out to condemn a ‘Dismantling Racism in Mathematics’ program which tells teachers not to push students to find the correct answers to math problems because doing so promotes white supremacy. The program is centered around a workbook for teachers entitled ‘A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction’ which asserts that America’s education system – even mathematics instruction – reinforces the dominant power structures of white colonizers. Legal tricks and statistical chicanery Attainment gaps incur legal penalties through what Rockwell terms 'a legal trick,' or what M. Lester O’Shea terms 'legal, statistical and verbal chicanery'—the concept of 'disparate impact.' This concept was invented by the Supreme Court of the United States in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971). According to the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, the aim of this concept is to safeguard black people from 'the repercussions of past discrimination': The disparate impact regulations seek to ensure that programs accepting federal money are not administered in a way that perpetuates the repercussions of past discrimination. As the Supreme Court has explained, even benignly-motivated policies that appear neutral on their face may be traceable to the nation’s long history of invidious race discrimination in employment, education, housing, and many other areas. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430–31 (1971); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 176–77 (1980); Gaston Cty. v. United States, 395 U.S. 285, 297 (1969). Unlike the concept of disparate treatment, which relates to how public institutions treat racial minorities, the concept of disparate impact focuses entirely on the effect on the 'victim.' As the DOJ adds, 'In a disparate impact case, the investigation focuses on the consequences of the recipient’s practices, rather than the recipient’s intent.' This is why civil rights activists highlight the role of data in revealing the impact of educational policies on black students. Rather than examining the curriculum or school attendance records, they can just check the gap between white and black performance—the gap is treated as evidence that the 'educational opportunities' are not 'meaningful' and 'Dr.' MLK-style dreams are then said not yet to be 'actualized': OCR’s enforcement, policy, technical assistance, and data responsibilities have considerable impact on whether or not students’ access to equal educational opportunities are meaningful and whether the rights of marginalized students to receive the supports and opportunities they deserve to achieve their dreams are actualized. The result of this trickery is that the civil rights framework does not require evidence of 'discrimination' in the sense most people understand that term. It relies on statistical gaps. The government has transformed power conferred upon it to eradicate 'discrimination' into a bureaucratic industry based on data showing statistical disparities between racial groups. The reason people do not object to this—despite Sowell’s work being widely known and despite cases of businesses driven to bankruptcy by racial discrimination claims based on nothing more than statistical chicanery—is that it is still socially unacceptable to be 'racist.' Caldwell observes that, 'The innovations of the 1960s had given progressives control over the most important levers of government, control that would endure for as long as the public was afraid of being called racist.' Caldwell shows that declaring civil rights enforcement to be 'unconstitutional,' far from resolving the dispute, merely restates the problem in different words. The problem is the contestation between the old de jure Constitution and the new de facto Civil Rights 'constitution.' Constitutional lawfare is, therefore, not able to resolve the essential danger that was correctly identified by Lew Rockwell in 1995: The Constitution has never stood in the way of civil rights enforcement. In the name of stamping out illegal discrimination, fundamental rights like freedom of association are denied daily… Politicians are promising to do something about it, but they have missed the larger point. Our troubles don’t stem from 'quotas,' 'set asides,' and the like; they stem from the presumption that government should be monitoring 'discrimination' in the first place. Pass all the anti-quota laws you want. Until anti-discrimination law is repealed, nothing can block the march of big government. About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

What Happens When China Puts Boots On The Ground In Myanmar? – An...	By David Hutt It now appears to be a question of 'when, not if' Chinese security personnel will arrive in Myanmar, with Beijing looking to secure its strategic interests in the war-torn country and those of its ally, the military junta that has lost large chunks of the country since the 2021 coup. The Irrawaddy online news outlet reported that the junta formed a 13-member working committee on October 22 to prepare the groundwork to establish a 'joint security company' with China. According to the report, the committee, chaired by Major-General Toe Yi, the junta’s deputy home affairs minister, is currently tasked with 'scrutinizing the importing and regulating of weapons and special equipment' until Beijing signs a drafted MOU on forming a 'security company.' After that, according to the narrative from Beijing and Naypyidaw, Chinese personnel would join a 'company' — more like a militia — alongside junta troops, which would be tasked with defending Chinese strategic and economic interests in the country. I’m told that China will send troops from the military and police in a 'private' capacity, giving the fiction of detachment. Yet this would not be a joint venture in anything but name. Does one seriously think that Chinese troops or police are going to listen to the Myanmar generals who have lost battle after battle to ethnic armies and ill-trained civilian militias over the past four years? Moreover, there is no reason to think that the China-junta 'militia' will stick to merely protecting Chinese nationals and Chinese-owned businesses in Myanmar. Chinese projects delayed It is true that Chinese assets have come under increased levels of attack from anti-junta forces in recent months. There is some logic, if you’re sitting in Beijing and Naypyidaw, in wanting to allow Chinese forces to help command most of northern Myanmar, giving junta forces a better chance of mopping up rebel forces elsewhere. The civil war has delayed key Chinese projects in the country, such as the long-planned China-Myanmar Economic Corridor between China’s Yunnan province and Myanmar’s Indian Ocean coast. Strategically key for Beijing is a port it wants to build in Rakhine state, allowing China to import oil and gas from the Middle East without ships needing to pass through the Malacca Strait, a potential chokepoint. This would be essential in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea, during which the Philippines or Taiwan could try to blockade Chinese trade, including oil and gas imports on which China’s economy depends. My sources say that the majority of the PLA contingent will be deployed to Rakhine state. According to statements released by Beijing, almost certainly intended to construct a peace narrative ahead of the deployment, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told junta leader Min Aung Hlaing in August that he hoped 'Myanmar will earnestly safeguard the safety of Chinese personnel and projects.' When Min Aung Hlaing visited China earlier this month, his first visit since the coup, Chinese Premier Li Qiang instructed him to 'take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese nationals, institutions, and projects in the country.' The reality, as Beijing knows well, is that the junta cannot ensure these things. That’s the entire reason why the 'security companies' are deemed necessary by the Chinese government. Offensive operations Once Chinese security personnel are on the ground in Myanmar, the fiction that they’re just standing guard outside a few industrial compounds or pipelines will become difficult to maintain. Indeed, they’re likely to have no choice but to mount offensive operations. The most obvious reason to expect this is that many Chinese-run enterprises are in territory currently controlled by resistance groups that will presumably need to be taken by Chinese forces. If not, why would Beijing make a u-turn on its existing policy, which had been to cajole and pay the ethnic militias to leave Chinese entities out of their fight with the junta? Secondly, after years of dallying, Beijing now clearly thinks that it cannot trust the anti-junta National Unity Government (NUG), presumably because it’s too pro-Western, nor most of the anti-junta ethnic militias – even those who have taken money from Beijing. Chinese authorities reportedly detained Peng Daxun, the leader of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), a militia that has inflicted heavy casualties on the junta, after he was summoned to Yunnan for a parlay last month. This may be a temporary detention pour encourager les autres, or it may be Beijing trying to dismantle disloyal militias more permanently. Yet, in essence, Beijing has now thrown its weight behind the junta because it presumably believes China’s interests would be best served by an outright junta victory. So if Beijing thinks the ultimate way of protecting Chinese business interests in Myanmar, for now and in the long term, is for the civil war to be ended and for junta forces to win the conflict decisively, the difference between Chinese security personnel conducting defensive and offensive operations is paper thin. Why wouldn’t Beijing use its troops to bring about its overarching goal? Why would Beijing overlook the opportunity to end a civil war that it wants over? Anti-China sentiment Why would Beijing merely send personnel to defend Chinese factories and pipelines for a few months or years if it thinks there is the possibility that forces hostile to Chinese interests could eventually take power nationally? Under these circumstances, Chinese personnel would think it justified, under the narrative of 'safeguarding the safety of Chinese nationals, institutions and projects in the country,' to wage offensive assaults against anti-junta forces across Myanmar. Granted, the junta is touchy about being seen as a lackey of Beijing — or about Myanmar becoming a protectorate of China. That is why Beijing has offered platitudes of a joint 'security company,' a fiction to get around Myanmar’s constitution that forbids the deployment of foreign troops. But what position will the junta be in to dictate what Chinese personnel can do or where they can go once they are in Myanmar? Lastly, does one imagine that anti-junta forces won’t retaliate against Chinese intervention, especially when that intervention is so clearly on behalf of the regime? Anti-China sentiment is running high in Myanmar and will boil over once Chinese troops and police step foot in the country. One can very easily imagine an escalating campaign of attacks by anti-junta forces on Chinese interests – increasing the incentives for Chinese security personnel to launch offensive operations. Once Chinese boots are on the ground in Myanmar, this means direct intervention by China – not merely an economic peacekeeping effort by joint 'security companies.' And Chinese personnel will have to conduct offensive operations – not just stand guard at Chinese-run factories and pipelines.

Abkhazia: Lots Of Drama Unlikely To Produce Change	By Irakli Machaidze (Eurasianet) -- A political crisis in the Russian-dominated, separatist entity of Abkhazia has been defused, but the underlying issue that prompted the unrest – legislation that would grant Russians favorable real estate investment privileges – remains unaddressed. In the end, Russia, the territory’s financial sponsor, is likely to end up getting what it wants. Opponents of the legislative measure to grant Russians insider access to real estate and other investment opportunities occupied the de-facto government’s offices in the Abkhaz capital Sokhumi on November 15, aiming to block passage of the bill. After a more than four-day standoff, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic, Aslan Bzhania, announced his resignation. In return, the protesters ended their occupation of government buildings, and an early election for the leadership of the territory, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s amid a civil conflict, was announced. Abkhazia’s de facto parliament has approved Bzhania’s resignation and on November 21 was still debating on a date for a snap election. The drama may end up being a case of much ado about nothing. Bzhania, who appears to retain Russia’s backing, has already announced his intention to run again. It remains unclear who opposition leaders will nominate as their candidate, or if they will opt to unify around a single candidate. The controversial Russian investment bill that was to have been debated and, likely, finalized on November 15, remains on the table, its fate uncertain. The agreement that defused the political crisis between the de facto government and its opposition did not address the fate of the bill. The Kremlin is unlikely to alter its intentions to dominate Abkhazia’s real estate market, even if Bzhania opponents come to power. According to sources in the Russian government, Moscow does not view Bzhania critics as opponents of the Kremlin’s wishes, the independent news outlet Vyorstka (Вёрстка) reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on November 18 emphasized Russia’s support for the swift normalization of the situation in Abkhazia, expressing hope it would remain within constitutional boundaries. When asked about the impact of the protests on bilateral relations, Peskov affirmed that ties with Abkhazia are 'a very important priority of our foreign policy.'

Poland: Warsaw Mayor Runs For President As Ruling Party’s Candida...	By Aleksandra Krzysztoszek (EurActiv) -- The Warsaw mayor won his party's primaries and will run to be the Polish president as the candidate of Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition (KO, EPP) alliance. In the primaries held on Friday (22 November), Rafał Trzaskowski beat foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, by wining 75% of the votes. 'I know that the winner will go to the elections with full determination,' Prime Minister and KO leader Donald Tusk said, announcing the outcome. Praised by his supporters for his skills and knowledge of foreign languages, Trzaskowski served as minister of digital affairs in the previous Tusk government between 2013 and 2014. He then became mayor of Warsaw in 2018 and was re-elected to the post in 2023. Trzaskowski thanked his voters and pointed out that KO had decided to hold primaries 'as a truly democratic party,' unlike the main opposition PiS (ECR), where party leader Jarosław Kaczyński has the final say. 'In PiS, just one voice counts. Here, every vote counts,' he said. Sikorski thanked his rival for a 'chivalrous competition' and praised his idea of organising primaries. He also called on those who voted for him to support Trzaskowski 'unconditionally' in the elections. 'Rafał, fight, fight, fight and win!' he told Trzaskowski. Trzaskowski is the clear favourite in the elections. According to the latest polls, he is likely to win no matter who the PiS nominates as its candidate. PiS to name its candidate on Sunday Incumbent Polish President Andrzej Duda is finishing his second term as president, the constitution stops him from running for another term. As a result, the PiS is looking for a new candidate, which it will announce as early as Sunday (24 November), according to party sources. The same sources suggest Karol Nawrocki, former head of the Institute of National Remembrance, will be the most likely contender. Other names that could be in the running include controversial former education minister, Przemysław Czarnek, MEP Tobiasz Bocheński, and former prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Mateusz Morawiecki is the least likely candidate for the PiS presidential nomination, as his tenure as prime minister may weigh against him. He has also expressed interest in the ECR leadership, currently held by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (FdI, ECR). After the party lost power in Poland, because of the 2023 parliamentary election, from PiS's perspective, keeping the presidency is crucial, as it would allow the party to maintain influence over the government and veto legislation. For the same reason, it is essential for Tusk's ruling coalition to win since it would no longer have to deal with presidents who veto laws and hamper the implementation of his party's policies. These include restoring judicial independence, which is key for Poland to receive further EU recovery funds. While the ruling coalition initially considered nominating a single candidate for president, at the end of the day, each party decided to run a separate candidate. Last week, parliamentary speaker and head of the Poland 2050 party (Renew), Szymon Hołownia, announced his bid. The Left (S&D) is going to name their candidate soon. The opposition Confederation (PfE/ESN) party nominated its co-leader, Sławomir Mentzen. The date of the elections has not been scheduled yet, but they will be held around spring of 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1ECldmmbkFqPY	2024-11-23T16:23:24-08:00	
MSMEs In ASEAN: Addressing The Financing Gap – OpEd	Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the life blood of ASEAN's economy. They make up for over 97% of all businesses, provide nearly 70% of employment, and contribute around 40% to the region's GDP. These businesses could be big or small - they could be the street-side food vendors in Bangkok, the family-owned coffee processors in Vietnam, and the tech startups emerging in Singapore's bustling ecosystem. Yet, despite playing a critical role in driving growth and innovation, they face a persistent, almost enigmatic problem: financing. Governments, banks, and even fintech platforms are pouring in funds to address this gap. Hence one would assume that it would be much easier for MSMEs to access the funds they need. But it may not be true. As per a report by ADB, there is a significant financing gap across ASEAN that exceeds a staggering $300 billion annually. It leaves many asking: Why, after so many initiatives and so much support, do MSMEs continue to struggle for financing? Governments of ASEAN member states are making strategic moves to tackle this issue. An example would be Indonesia's recent loan forgiveness program. The initiative was just recently launched in November 2024, which allows MSMEs with debts under 500 million Indonesian rupiah to clear their bad loans with state banks. The aim is to have over three million of these businesses get a fresh start and a second chance to succeed. On the private sector front, financial giants, HSBC, unveiled a $1 billion ASEAN Growth Fund which would also support MSMEs desiring to scale up digital platform businesses. Although the idea is simple, it is transformative. The initiative will empower MSMEs to embrace technology and thrive in the digital economy. Fintech platforms have got a head start and are rewriting the rules of MSME financing. Funding Societies is one of Southeast Asia’s largest MSME digital finance platform and it has already disbursed over $3 billion in loans. Partnerships with traditional banks are further amplifying this impact. Maybank is one of the large banks in southeast Asia that has recently invested in the platform and has commended the fintech firm for bridging the financing gap. The rise of digital lending and crowdfunding platforms has helped MSMEs immensely as now they can now bypass the cumbersome paperwork and collateral requirements of traditional loans. Yet, even with all these new developments in the finance landscape, many MSMEs are still deprived of the finances they so badly need to both start and grow their businesses. When starting an enterprise, MSMEs are unable to provide adequate collateral or formal financial records needed for securing loans from banks. Historically banks perceive MSMEs as high risk, which limits MSMEs access to resources. Fragmented regulatory environment across ASEAN further complicates the situation. Each country in the ASEAN region has its own definitions and rules for MSMEs and this creates unnecessary hurdles for regional financing initiatives. This lack of consistency often makes it challenging for cross-border financiers to introduce uniform lending products. Some MSMEs, despite running their businesses successfully for over a decade, are repeatedly denied loans just because they are unable to provide formal collateral. Banks often need land deeds or large deposits as collateral making it even harder for the MSMEs. Without access to formal financing, they often turn to informal lending where the interest could be exorbitant. Some MSME report that they are charged 2% to as high as 20% per month as interest from these informal lending channels. Without proper financing MSMEs cannot grow and the alternatives too are exploitative. These highlight the glaring mismatch between what MSMEs need and what is currently available. Indeed, the government programs and fintech platforms have made progress but there’s still a long way to go. Policymakers and financial institutions must rethink their strategies and address the root causes of these challenges. One immediate solution could be to develop a centralized credit database for ASEAN. Such a system would aggregate and share MSME credit information from across the region, thus, making it easier for banks and fintech platforms to assess risk and provide loans confidently. Harmonizing MSME definitions and regulations across ASEAN through a standardized framework would simplify cross-border financing and make regional initiatives more effective. Financial literacy programs tailored for MSMEs provide small business owners the much-needed guidance on managing finances and effectively using digital tools. Singapore’s SkillsFuture program and Malaysia’s SMECorp serve as strong examples of how targeted training can empower small business owners. ASEAN’s digital economy is projected to grow to $1 trillion by 2030 and this offers immense opportunities for MSMEs to integrate and thrive. MSMEs are the backbone of ASEAN economies. Although these businesses are small, their impact on economies and societies is massive. Hence the effort should be to not just to close the financing gap but to unlock the full potential of MSMEs as drivers of inclusive and sustainable growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EBWSpE5FfLrj	2024-11-23T16:21:11-08:00	
Robert Reich: GM, Corporate Greed, And The Reason The Democrats L...	At the same time Democrats and progressives are justifiably enraged at Trump’s gonzo Cabinet picks, they’re all but mute about corporate America’s continued siphoning of economic gains to the top. Yet this siphoning has created the stagnant wages and insecure jobs that helped propel Trump into the presidency and give Republicans control over both chambers of Congress. Trump at least gave workers an explanation for what’s happened to them — although it was a lie: It isn’t undocumented immigrants or the 'deep state' or transgender kids or any other Trump bogeyman. It’s corporate greed. The most recent example: On Friday, GM announced it was laying off 1,000 workers. These layoffs followed another round of GM layoffs in August, which saw 1,500 jobs cut. The cuts affected both salaried and hourly staff, including some United Auto Workers members. Most of the workers being laid off Friday were notified via email early Friday morning. Some had been working for GM for over thirty years. GM says it has no choice. It must cut costs. This is what we hear again and again from corporate America. We’ll be hearing even more of this as Artificial Intelligence takes over white-collar as well as blue-collar jobs. No choice? GM is on track for making record profits this year, surpassing its 2022 record profit of $14.5 billion. In the third quarter of 2024 alone, GM made $3.4 billion. That’s a $200 million increase from the same period last year. GM CEO Mary Barra’s compensation for 2024 is $27.8 million. This includes a base salary of $2.1 million, stock awards of $14.6 million, stock option awards valued at $4.9 million, an 'incentive plan' compensation (as if she needed more incentive) of $5.3 million, other payment of $997,392, and perks (personal travel, security, financial counseling, company vehicles, and an executive health plan) valued at $389,005. The ratio of Barra’s compensation to that of the typical GM employee is estimated to be 303-to-1. In June, GM announced $6 billion in stock buybacks. This means $6 billion of GM’s record profits will be used to purchase its own shares of stock — thereby boosting share prices (and the portion of Barra’s compensation in stock grants and options) simply because fewer shares of GM stock will be in circulation. Keep in mind that the richest 1 percent of American hold over half of the value of all shares of stock held by Americans, and the richest 10 percent hold 92 percent. So, in fact, GM’s savings from axing 1,000 jobs will be transferred into the pockets of wealthy Americans (including GM’s CEO). Why aren’t Democrats up in arms about this? I haven’t heard Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, or any other leading Democrat say a critical word about GM’s latest move. Why isn’t Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer — who may be in the running for president in 2028 (assuming we have another election) — accusing GM of sacrificing jobs for profits that are siphoned off to big investors? Why aren’t Democrats, who still control the Senate and presidency, moving more aggressively to outlaw stock buybacks — which were considered illegal stock manipulations before Ronald Reagan’s SEC gave them the green light? Why aren’t they demanding that capital gains taxes be increased on the super-wealthy, whose stock gains this year alone have made America’s billionaires 30 percent richer? Why aren’t they moving to increase corporate taxes on corporations whose ratio of CEO pay to their median workers is more than 50 to 1? And impose even higher taxes if the ratio exceeds 100 to 1? (Senate Budget Committee Chair Sheldon Whitehouse, along with Representatives Barbara Lee and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have introduced just such a bill, but no one knows about it. Why isn’t the Democratic leadership loudly pushing this?) The lesson of the debacle of the 2024 election is that big corporations and the wealthy have shafted average working Americans, whose wages and jobs have gone nowhere for decades and who are understandably frustrated and angry at what they see as a rigged system. But Democrats have offered no alternative explanation for what’s happened to average working people or agenda for remedying it. Trump's baseless explanation and agenda are the only ones available. So it’s no surprise that many working Americans voted for Trump on Election Day. Now Trump and his Republican stooges think they’ve been given a license to blow the system up — initially by appointing a bunch of clowns, conspiracy theorists, and sexual predators to key posts. It’s important to rail against Trump’s appointments. But unless we attack the sources of the outrage Trump has tapped into, working Americans will continue to go along with whatever Trump and his lapdogs want to do.

Zelenskyy Says Putin Aiming To Regain Kursk Territory Before Trum...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia is seeking to drive his forces out of the Kursk region before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year but added that the military situation in the Donetsk region is the most critical for his country. 'I am certain that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to push us out before January 20,' Zelenskiy told reporters, referring to the day of Trump’s inauguration. 'It is very important for him to show that he controls the situation' in Kursk. Ukraine stunned the Kremlin by sweeping into the Kursk region in August, seizing nearly 1,400 square kilometers of Russian territory. With Trump promising to end the war upon entering office, Moscow could be forced to exchange land it seized in Ukraine for Kursk territory should it fail to push Ukrainian forces out in time. Putin has sent tens of thousands of Russian troops to Kursk who are mounting wave after wave of counterattacks, a source on Ukraine's General Staff said. Russia has regained about 800 square kilometers in Kursk or about 40 percent of the territory Ukraine seized, the source said. Zelenskiy said that Ukrainian troops are inflicting large-scale losses on Russian forces in Kursk. Russia has recently been losing as many as 1,500 troops a day to injury and death across the entire theater of the war, the most since the invasion began in February 2022, Ukrainian and Western officials said. 'Russia hasn’t suffered such losses as it is now suffering in Kursk,' Zelenskiy said. Russia has recruited more than 11,000 North Korean troops to help it take back Kursk territory. The North Korean troops reportedly arrived last month though it is unclear if they have taken part in fighting yet. The United States and the United Kingdom reportedly gave permission this week to Ukraine to strike inside Russia with ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles respectively. The missiles are precision, tactical weapons designed to hit command-and-control centers, logistics and arms depots near the front. Ukraine has already used the missiles to strike in Kursk and the neighboring region of Belgorod. Russian Advances Meanwhile, Russian ground forces continue to make incremental advances in eastern Ukraine, including near the town of Velyka Novosilka, according to Deep State, an open-source organization with ties to the Ukrainian Army, and confirmed by other analysts. Ukraine has been struggling to hold back the Russian advances due to a lack of manpower, raising concern about a possible breakthrough. While Russia is losing forces at a greater rate, the Kremlin is able to quickly replace them thanks to lucrative wages and incentives. Putin on November 23 widened those incentives, signing a law permitting the cancellation of debt for new army recruits volunteering to fight in Ukraine. The new law allows the state to forgive up to 10 million rubles ($95,835) of debt for those signing contracts with the Defense Ministry to fight in Ukraine for at least a year, beginning on December 1. The law applies to all potential recruits who have had debt collection proceedings opened against them before December 1. The maximum debt forgiveness is several times the average annual salary in Russia’s provinces. Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, said in an interview published on November 23 that new technological advances will prevent a 'serious breakthrough' at the front. Ukraine and Russia have been rapidly developing reconnaissance and strike drones as well as electronic warfare weapons. The technology advancements have helped Ukraine partially compensate for its lack of manpower. In the interview, Zaluzhniy said that Russia will struggle to expand the front line and break through because it would require huge resources 'which the Russians no longer have.' Trump Presidency U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his counterparts from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized nations outside Rome on November 25-26 to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will be the last G7 meeting for the Biden administration, which is seeking to ensure that support for Ukraine is sustained when Trump enters office in January. Trump has criticized aid to Ukraine, raising questions whether he will continue support should a peace deal not be reached. The president-elect met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Florida on November 22 to discuss Ukraine and other issues facing the alliance. Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly considering Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, for the new post of special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Zelenskiy told reporters that the war could end next year if Ukraine continues to get strong Western support. Zelenskiy spoke with media following the Grain From Ukraine Summit in Kyiv. Ukraine is one of the largest exporters of grains to world markets. Prior to the conference, Zelenskiy visited a memorial to the victims of the Holodomor, the man-made famine orchestrated by the Soviet government in the 1930s that led to the deaths of millions of Ukrainians. In a clear reference to Putin’s war against Ukraine, Zelenskiy said: 'There is something we know for certain. They wanted to destroy us. To kill us. To subjugate us. They failed.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EHU1m4isyQp_	2024-11-23T16:17:18-08:00	
How The West Prospers As The Rest Drown – OpEd	By Hafed Al-Ghwell Global financial systems are metaphorically connected vessels, in which the policies of one country can create ripples felt by another. Recently, a troubling phenomenon has emerged: Wealthier Western economies, in their bid to tame inflation — often driven by corporate greed or 'greedflation' — are adopting high interest rates. This seemingly domestic monetary policy has severe reverberations for the Global South’s poorer economies, precipitating a sovereign debt crisis of unprecedented scale.In their quest to tame domestic inflation, Western central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, often resort to hiking interest rates, a strategy that, while stabilizing their own economies, wreaks havoc on poorer nations. This policy tightens domestic credit but has dire global ramifications, particularly for emerging economies saddled with substantial dollar-denominated debt. As these rates climb, so do the costs of borrowing, making debt repayment increasingly untenable. For example, following the interest rate increases in 2022, many developing countries faced ballooning debt servicing costs alongside severe currency depreciation.These nations end up caught in a vicious cycle: They must allocate more of their scarce resources to debt repayment while their currencies weaken, further inflating their debt burden. The situation echoes the debt crises of the 1980s — often referred to as the 'Volcker shock' — that crippled Latin America and Africa, but now with the additional burden of complex, commercially sourced debt, leading to prolonged economic stagnation and deepening inequalities.The Global South’s debt crisis is not merely a financial predicament but a consequence of deeply entrenched imbalances in the global economic order. As Western nations, such as the US and the UK, enjoy the privilege of issuing debt in their own currencies, countries like Zambia and Sri Lanka are forced to borrow in foreign currencies, often at exorbitant interest rates. This structural disparity means that, while rich countries can manage high debt-to-gross domestic product ratios without existential threat — Japan’s stands at 254 percent — poorer economies buckle under far lower ratios.The result is a drain on their national budgets, diverting funds away from essential sectors like healthcare, education and infrastructure. For instance, Zambia’s external debt ballooned to $12.5 billion by 2021, driven partly by illicit financial flows and loss of export revenues to foreign investors. These dynamics lock these nations in a vicious cycle, with the burden of debt service stifling economic growth and perpetuating poverty, effectively allowing the Global North to outsource economic hardship to already-struggling economies. The question then becomes not just one of immediate debt relief, but of rethinking a flawed multilateral system that continuously disadvantages the Global South.Beyond the surface threats of potential default and sluggish growth, the relentless escalation of debt repayments forces poorer nations into austerity traps, decimating their socioeconomic fabric. Austerity measures, often mandated by international creditors like the International Monetary Fund, primarily hurt the disadvantaged, skewing income distribution by shifting benefits to the top 10 percent, while impoverishing the bottom 80 percent. The austerity cycle leads to stagnant or declining real wages and mounting unemployment, pressuring local labor markets to compromise on pay, worsening existing inequalities. This creates fertile ground for socioeconomic instability, directly impeding human capital development and long-term economic prospects. International financial structures, skewed toward creditor interests, thus perpetuate a cycle in which the Global South is structurally disadvantaged, effectively condemning it to tread water in a sea of debt as wealthier nations consolidate their prosperity.The disparity in global economic policy, with Western economies vigorously combating inflation through aggressive monetary policies, heavily burdens the Global South. As interest rates rise in the Global North, debt servicing costs for poorer nations soar, exacerbating their financial woes and precipitating potential defaults. High inflation and modest global growth compound these challenges, pushing 15 percent of poor countries into debt distress and leaving half on the brink.This is not merely about domestic stability, it also highlights an alarming neglect of the broader international economic repercussions. Such policies significantly strain global economic health, fostering inequality as these nations grapple with austerity measures, deteriorating socioeconomic conditions and hindered long-term recovery. This cyclical debt enmeshment prevents the Global South from achieving sustainable development, while rich nations consolidate their prosperity, laying bare a systemic financial inequity that threatens global stability.It is this precise dynamic that epitomizes how the West prospers as the rest drown. As wealthier nations move to protect their markets and labor forces, poorer countries continue to bear the brunt. An ensuing cycle of debt and dependency effectively ensures that, while the Global North establishes a semblance of economic order, the Global South remains ensnared in a web of borrowing and austerity. In recent years, the inevitable widening gap between the West and the rest of the world has become unsustainable.A comprehensive overhaul of international debt policies is long overdue. The current case-by-case basis of the G20 Common Framework is ineffective, failing to offer the predictability necessary for substantial debt relief. A more systematic approach is essential, one that includes a multilateral sovereign debt restructuring mechanism. This would facilitate fair and equitable treatment across all creditors, ensuring that countries can prioritize investments in green growth and climate resilience without being shackled by debilitating debt service obligations.Moreover, to address the urgency driven by climate priorities that have languished under underfunded commitments, a dual-pillar approach is necessary. Countries with dire debt situations require comprehensive restructuring involving all forms of international creditors — private, bilateral and multilateral. This should be reminiscent of the large-scale debt relief initiatives of the early 2000s, adapted to the current needs of climate and development investments. For less-indebted nations, enhancing credit and providing debt suspension through multilateral institutions could offer more fiscal space and reduced capital costs, enabling them to meet climate and development goals more effectively.Simultaneously, geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism pose significant risks to global cooperation. Multilateral dialogue between major global powers like the US and China is crucial to navigating these geopolitical frictions. Additionally, fostering a supportive environment for affordable lending from multilateral development banks and new issuances of special drawing rights can provide the necessary liquidity for emerging markets.Such innovative, equitable solutions are imperative — not only to address the financial disparities exacerbated by climate disasters but also to stave off the social instability that unchecked debt crises are bound to trigger. Thus, an urgent, holistic and collaborative strategy is essential for a truly balanced global economic order, before the West ultimately drowns the rest.

Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2024: Redefining BJP’s Alliance Dy...	The assembly election results for Maharashtra and Jharkhand have been announced, highlighting a pivotal development in Indian politics. Maharashtra’s results have attracted significant attention because of its critical role in national politics, despite both states having their own political significance. Maharashtra, the second-largest state in India by population and political influence, has 48 Lok Sabha seats, positioning it as a key player in the national political landscape. The state’s role in the recent general elections, conducted six months ago, is crucial, particularly as the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, encountered a notable setback. The BJP, despite being the ruling alliance in Maharashtra, managed to secure only 17 Lok Sabha seats, indicating a disappointing performance for a party that excelled nationally. Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh significantly contributed to the Congress and its allies' performance in the general elections, reflecting a broader trend. The general election results in Maharashtra provided a rare moment of hope, despite Congress’ national defeat. Rahul Gandhi characterized the party's robust performance in the state as indicative of a resurgence, enhancing optimism for the upcoming assembly elections. Congress and its allies sought to replicate their success, driven by confidence in their momentum.The assembly elections represented a crucial opportunity for the BJP to regain its standing. The party underwent a thorough introspection and strategic overhaul, re-energizing its cadre and revamping its campaign. This led to a focused three-month effort aimed at regaining Maharashtra’s trust through an aggressive campaign blitz. However, the recent assembly election results are not just about the balance of power in Maharashtra but also reflect the evolving political dynamics in India. They signify whether the BJP’s corrective measures have borne fruit or if Congress and its allies have managed to consolidate their gains from the general elections. The outcome of these elections will undoubtedly set the tone for future political strategies and alliances, not only in Maharashtra but across the nation. As the analysis of today’s results concludes, Maharashtra’s political importance is clearly reaffirmed. The BJP has secured 132 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena has added 57, and the NCP has claimed 41. This results in a total of 230 seats for the BJP-led NDA, highlighting the state's significance as an indicator of changing political dynamics in India. BJP's Course Correction and Historic Victory in Maharashtra Elections: Key Factors The BJP-led alliance’s success in the Maharashtra assembly elections was a testament to its strategic recalibration and ground-level mobilization. A combination of organizational unity, grassroots outreach, policy-driven engagement, and strategic leadership turned the tide in its favor. Below are the key factors that underpinned this victory: 1. Flawless Coordination Among Alliance Partners The BJP-led alliance, which includes the BJP, Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction), and the Ajit Pawar faction of the NCP, demonstrated effective coordination. This alliance effectively addressed seat-sharing and other contentious issues, unlike their opposition counterparts. Their unified stance provided a notable advantage, as even BJP candidates entered constituencies typically assigned to their allies without undermining the alliance’s unity. The Congress-led coalition experienced significant internal discord. The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP are in conflict regarding seat-sharing arrangements, resulting in public disputes. The disunity among opposition forces created confusion and mistrust among voters, resulting in a distinct advantage for the BJP. 2. RSS Cadre: The Backbone of BJP's Ground Campaign The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) played a pivotal role in mobilizing voters at the grassroots level. The BJP's strength lay in its ability to organize large rallies and mega-events; however, it was the RSS's detailed door-to-door campaigning that proved decisive. The RSS launched a targeted voter outreach program focusing on specific demographics, including the elderly and differently-abled individuals. The campaign effectively mobilized voters over 80 and those with disabilities, resulting in high voter turnout. The RSS conducted more than 60,000 statewide public meetings, establishing a direct link with voters. The meetings focused on local grievances, clarified the alliance’s vision, and established a strong support base. This extensive ground network provides a significant competitive advantage, as no other party in India has a similar organizational structure capable of influencing voters at such a detailed level. 3. Policy Implementation and Welfare Schemes The BJP effectively communicated its success in welfare policies, which appealed to voters. Initiatives aimed at women, including financial incentives, subsidized gas cylinders, and education programs, resonated with female voters, a key demographic in this election. The revision of Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and enhanced market access have been advantageous for farmers. Party workers closely observed the implementation of these programs, confirming that beneficiaries received their entitlements. The hands-on approach strengthened voter confidence in the BJP's dedication to governance. 4. Polarization and Strategic Leadership The strategic involvement of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was a key factor in BJP’s success, as his rallies effectively mobilized the Hindu voter base. The slogan 'Batoge to Katoge' (division leads to defeat) effectively polarized Hindu voters in support of the BJP. This message challenged the BJP’s characterization of 'vote jihad,' a term used to describe the alleged strategic voting behaviors of Muslim voters opposing the party. The opposition’s effort to consolidate Muslim votes and launching caste-based census agenda against the BJP proved ineffective in polarized constituencies, leading to a significant mobilization of Hindu voters in support of the BJP. The BJP’s campaign leveraged this dynamic, strengthening its support base. 5. Youth Engagement and Digital Campaigns BJP launched focused digital campaigns on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and WhatsApp to engage first-time voters. The campaigns emphasized job creation, development initiatives, and nationalist sentiments, targeting the aspirations of younger voters. The party's local leadership engaged with student unions and youth organizations, positioning the BJP as a party of growth and opportunity. This outreach reinforced their dominance in a key demographic. 6. Charismatic Leadership and Star Campaigners Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rallies played a crucial role in the campaign, emphasizing the BJP’s focus on development and national pride. His speeches attracted large audiences, generating momentum that resulted in votes. Devendra Fadnavis and Eknath Shinde were instrumental in localizing the campaign, focusing on regional issues, and effectively countering opposition narratives. The BJP effectively addressed macro-level issues and micro-level voter concerns, resulting in a turnaround that solidified its dominance in the state. Also, this victory reinforces BJP’s state-level dominance and boosts the party’s morale as it prepares for future challenges in the national political arena. Strengthening BJP’s Agenda Amidst a Fragmented Opposition The BJP’s lack of a full majority in the Lok Sabha necessitates reliance on ally support to progress its legislative agenda. A Congress win in Maharashtra would have bolstered the opposition, especially the I.N.D.I.A. Alliance, enhancing their ability to challenge BJP policies nationally.Maharashtra, being India’s second-largest state, holds significant political influence. The defeat of Congress undermines its momentum, hindering its ability to effectively challenge the BJP at the national level. Success in Maharashtra would have enabled Congress to more effectively challenge BJP’s policies, encompassing economic reforms and social issues. Now, the weakened position of Congress allows the BJP to strengthen its dominance within the NDA, thereby increasing its parliamentary power. The weakened and divided position of the Congress undermines the integrity of the INDIA Alliance, diminishing its effectiveness as a cohesive opposition to the BJP. The discord among Congress’s allies in Maharashtra, particularly between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena faction and Sharad Pawar’s NCP faction, has highlighted the alliance’s weaknesses. The BJP-led NDA Alliance is expected to strengthen by capitalizing on the opportunity to attract dissatisfied leaders from opposition parties. The results in Maharashtra will strengthen the BJP's strategy for other states, reducing the INDIA Alliance's overall influence ahead of the upcoming general elections. The discord within the NCP following the elections may lead to additional defections to the BJP, thereby strengthening its influence in Maharashtra and diminishing the opposition's morale on a national level. Increased Rajya Sabha Influence for BJP The Congress defeat in Maharashtra has notable long-term implications for the Rajya Sabha elections. Maharashtra contributes 19 members to the Rajya Sabha, highlighting its significance in shaping the upper house of Parliament. Congress, along with its allies Shiv Sena and NCP, has historically maintained influence in Rajya Sabha, attributed to their dominance at the state level. Their defeat in Maharashtra limits their capacity to obtain sufficient seats in the state assembly for nominating members to the Rajya Sabha. Opposition leaders from these parties are likely to face challenges in accessing Parliament’s upper house. Conversely, the BJP, traditionally weaker in the Rajya Sabha than in the Lok Sabha, is poised for substantial gains. The BJP's enhanced majority in Maharashtra enables it to secure Rajya Sabha seats for its candidates, thereby strengthening its legislative power. The loss of Congress enhances BJP’s capacity to advance its legislative goals while simultaneously undermining the opposition's attempts at unity. This victory represents a crucial advancement for the BJP in preparation for the 2024 general elections, while Congress and its allies must confront the challenge of reorganizing and developing new strategies following their electoral defeat. The BJP’s Electoral Mandate Redefines Alliance Dynamics in Maharashtra The BJP’s victory in Maharashtra has altered the power dynamics within its alliance, especially concerning the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) and the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction). The BJP’s current strengthened mandate enables it to assertively claim the Chief Minister’s position, a role it has traditionally relinquished to allies, despite its electoral advantages in past alliances where concessions were made for coalition stability. Key Historical Context 2014 Elections: In the 2014 Elections, the BJP secured 122 seats, making it the single largest party, yet it did not achieve a majority. The government was formed with Shiv Sena, granting substantial portfolios despite existing tensions. 2019 Elections: In the 2019 elections, the BJP formed an alliance with Shiv Sena, achieving a majority. However, the alliance disintegrated due to Shiv Sena's insistence on the Chief Minister's position. Uddhav Thackeray formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in alliance with Congress and NCP. 2022 Elections: 2022 Political Shift: Eknath Shinde's rebellion led to the split of Shiv Sena, resulting in BJP appointing Shinde as Chief Minister while retaining a junior partner role in state leadership to ensure alliance stability. Post-2024 Election Dynamics The 2024 assembly elections represent a crucial juncture for BJP in Maharashtra, significantly altering the dynamics of political alliances. 1. Shiv Sena (Shinde Faction): Eknath Shinde’s faction, currently in the Chief Minister’s position, faces considerable pressure to transfer authority to the BJP. The faction's dependence on BJP's organizational and electoral strength has increased due to declining public support and internal divisions. The BJP’s vote share exceeds that of its allies combined, indicating a clear power imbalance within the alliance. 2. NCP (Ajit Pawar Faction): The NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar has diminished bargaining power due to a lackluster electoral performance. The emphasis will likely transition to maintaining essential portfolios instead of challenging the BJP's assertion of leadership. This change in alliance dynamics enables the BJP to not only attain the Chief Minister’s position but also to reinforce its dominance in Maharashtra’s political arena, thereby enhancing its influence at both state and national levels. Why BJP Will Push for Chief Ministership Reflecting Electoral Mandate: The BJP’s dominance in the alliance and its claim to the Chief Minister’s position aligns with voter preferences, thereby reinforcing the party’s brand in Maharashtra. Learning from Past Errors: The BJP has recognized the implications of the 2019 setback, where yielding the Chief Minister’s position to Shiv Sena resulted in the loss of government control. The BJP aims to avoid compromises that could lead to defections or internal power struggles within the alliance. Expanding Organizational Control: A BJP Chief Minister enables the party to strengthen its grassroots network and exert greater influence over state-level policies, especially in anticipation of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Precedents and Public Sentiment The BJP has consistently highlighted its focus on stable governance and decisive leadership, appealing to the electorate. Core voters in Maharashtra have previously shown dissatisfaction regarding concessions granted to allies. BJP's claim to the Chief Minister’s office meets its base's expectations and enhances accountability. BJP’s pursuit of the Chief Minister’s position appears assured, yet effectively handling ally expectations will be crucial. The party must provide strategic portfolios to its allies to sustain alliance unity while asserting its leadership position. BJP in Bihar effectively managed its alliances until the coalition structure collapsed. BJP is expected to take a pragmatic approach in Maharashtra by rewarding its allies and maintaining its leadership position. Conclusions The Maharashtra elections have altered the BJP’s position within its alliance. The party, backed by a strong electoral mandate and insights from previous compromises, is set to regain the Chief Minister’s position. This move would strengthen BJP’s control in Maharashtra and enhance its leadership role within the alliance. BJP's strong performance in key assembly by-elections in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan highlight its increasing momentum across various regions. The party experienced a setback in Jharkhand; however, the small state’s limited political significance is unlikely to hinder BJP’s resurgence. These outcomes reinforce BJP’s narrative of governance and organizational strength, establishing it as a significant contender for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. BJP is establishing itself as a leader in state and national politics, reinforcing its position as a central pillar in Indian political dynamics.

China Should Be Worried About North Korea: How To Make Beijing A ...	In recent days North Korea has become a problem child not only for China but for the US as well. Its dictator Kim Jong Un who rules by fear of persecution or death to those people he considers disloyal to his regime, a characteristic that all dictators have to perpetuate their rule. Adolf Hitler who had fought in the First Great War had this characteristic in abundance and took advantage of the burning of Reichstag and total disregard of the treaty he had signed with the Soviet Union. Recently White House confirmed that North Korea—a country with few allies and little money—had sent thousands of soldiers to join Russia in its war against Ukraine. But sending personnel marks a new level of coordination. There are other signs of warming ties, too. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first trip to North Korea in over two decades. CHINA’S DISPLEASURE OVER RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA TIES That proximity has irked China, North Korea’s main backer. Chinese officials fear that Russia’s influence over the insular dictatorship is growing at China’s expense. They also worry that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will strengthen military cooperation in response to Russia and North Korea’s newfound closeness. Over the past year, Beijing has chosen to react to Pyongyang’s collaboration with Moscow by publicly courting North Korea’s adversaries. For instance, in May, China held a trilateral summit with South Korea and Japan after a five-year hiatus. Russia and North Korea signed an agreement on boosting economic cooperation following a meeting between trade officials in Pyongyang. Hungary will install additional air defense systems in the northeast of the country due to concerns over the fighting in Ukraine spreading into Hungarian territory. The Hungarian defense minister said the threat of escalation between Ukraine and Russia is 'greater than ever.' Russia became the top supplier of natural gas to the European Union in September for the first time since May 2022, according to a calculation by Russia’s RIA Novosti using Eurostat data. European purchases of Russian gas in September were valued at 1.4 billion euros ($1.47 billion), an increase of a third over the previous September. Roughly forty percent of the supplies is liquefied natural gas and sixty percent is pipeline gas. CHINA-SOUTH KOREA HOLD SECURITY DIALOGUE Chinese and South Korean officials held a security dialogue in Seoul—the first such meeting in nine years. This seeming friction between China and North Korea has tantalized many Western security analysts, who have argued that the United States and its allies should try to drive a wedge between China and North Korea. Such an effort, however, would be futile. Despite signs of tension between the two countries, North Korea is overwhelmingly reliant on China. Nearly all of its trade, for instance, is with China. The countries have not always seen eye to eye but their relationship has never come close to splintering. WHAT THE USA SHOULD DO? Instead of focusing on what could divide North Korea from China, the United States should collaborate with the Chinese government to rein in North Korea’s volatile behavior. Both the United States and China are ultimately invested in maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula. Working together to restrain the North Korean regime is the best way to achieve it. Although North Korea is often imagined these days as a mere satrap of China, it is not, in fact, a Chinese vassal, and it has long sought to achieve a great degree of autonomy in its foreign policy. The two countries have endured many moments of friction in their relationship. The fact that China tolerated open criticism of North Korea’s leadership put further strain on the relationship between the two governments. During the rapprochement between China and the United States in the 1970s North Korea hosted Soviet naval ships in its ports and allowed Soviet fighter jets to enter North Korean airspace. CHINA’S DIPLOMATIC CONTACT WITH SOUTH KOREA. Throughout the 1980s, in response to North Korea’s tilt toward Russia, China increased its diplomatic contacts with South Korea. Relations between China and North Korea hit another low point in 1992, when China formally established diplomatic relations with South Korea against Kim’s wishes. China further irked North Korea by joining international sanctions against Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons programs in 2006. Pyongyang, for its part, often acted without consulting Beijing on matters that could seriously affect China’s security. In 2006, following North Korea’s first nuclear test, Beijing accused Pyongyang of 'brazen' action, a term rarely used in official Chinese statements. North Korea’s nuclear tests violated a treaty between the two countries that requires them to 'consult with each other on all important international questions of common interest.' WHY NORTH KOREA TURNED TO RUSSIA Unsure of China’s intentions, North Korea has turned to Russia for economic, diplomatic, and military cooperation. Through these punitive measures, China is not just trying to chastise Pyongyang for cozying up to Russia; it’s also seeking to curry favor with the United States and Europe. Since the summit between Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden in November 2023, Beijing has appeared determined to stabilize U.S.-Chinese relations so that it can still attract foreign investment from Western countries and maintain strong trading ties with them. In this context, North Korea’s belligerence toward South Korea and Japan and its military support of Russia has become a liability for China’s engagement with the West, because the United States and Europe see China as North Korea’s patron, and therefore as partly responsible for Pyongyang’s behavior. UNCERTAINITY IN CHINA IF NORTH KOREA IS PUSHED TO A CORNER. It is highly uncertain—even to China’s leadership—how Pyongyang would act if backed into a corner. In the worst-case scenario, Pyongyang may resort to attacking South Korea to deliberately create an external crisis, forcing China to intervene on North Korea’s behalf. Therefore, Beijing has to carefully assess the risks when considering how much it can push North Korea. In the current era of U.S.-Chinese strategic competition, North Korea’s value to China extends beyond its role as a buffer zone between Chinese and U.S. forces. From Beijing’s perspective, during a conflict with the United States over Taiwan, maintaining close ties with North Korea is advantageous because Pyongyang can help tie down U.S. troops in the region by keeping open the possibility of another war. But it remains uncertain whether Beijing would coordinate with North Korea before taking military action against Taiwan or whether they would even want to coordinate such involvement if it could lead to conflict spreading from the Taiwan Strait to the Korean Peninsula. US SHOULD PREVENT OUTBREAK OF WAR ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA To avoid such an outcome, the United States and its allies should focus on identifying interests they share with China: namely, preventing the outbreak of a war on the Korean Peninsula. Expecting Beijing to take extreme measures, such as suspending oil supplies or humanitarian aid to North Korea, is unrealistic. Instead of driving China and North Korea apart, Washington should try to capitalize on Beijing’s power over Pyongyang by urging China to clearly communicate two redlines to its partner. First, North Korea must refrain from directly assaulting South Korean lives and property, as it did in the 2010 Cheonan torpedo attack and Yeonpyeong Island shelling. Since these incidents, South Korea’s military doctrine has become far more offensive. Any North Korean attack, even on a limited scale, would trigger South Korean retaliation, and could spiral into all-out war. Second, North Korea must avoid conducting its seventh nuclear test. A seventh test would likely be geared toward developing a nuclear weapon with a small yield that would be easier to deploy. Such a test would be a sign of China’s weakening influence over Pyongyang and could spur Seoul to try to acquire nuclear weapons of its own—a position that both South Korea and the United States officially oppose but is gaining traction in Western policy circles. DEEPENING TIES WITH RUSSIA POSES CONCERN RELATING TO WAR IN UKRAINE AND SECURITY ON KOREAN PENINSULA. The deepening ties between Russia and North Korea have sparked significant concerns in the US regarding the potential impact on the war in Ukraine and security on the Korean Peninsula. But the rapprochement between Moscow and Pyongyang has also caused mixed feelings in Beijing, as they create new uncertainty for China. Despite being North Korea’s neighbor, economic lifeline and formal ally, China’s relations with North Korea are far from close, as recent developments indicate. North Korea’s condemnation of a joint statement by South Korea, Japan, and China during their first trilateral summit since 2019 was seen as a rare rebuke against China. The statement mentioned denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang’s provocative actions around the same time further signaled its displeasure with the summit. It is remarkable that the Kim regime chose to launch a military spy satellite into orbit during a major diplomatic initiative involving China. The last time North Korea clearly sought to embarrass China was shortly prior to the inaugural Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in May 2017, when it conducted a missile launch from a base near the Chinese border. Since then, the regional dynamics have shifted significantly. IMROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA WITH APPEARANCE OF XI-JINPING. After hitting their lowest point in decades in 2017, China-North Korea relations began to improve significantly following the first meeting between Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un in March 2018. Despite having met five times since then, their relationship is not back to being 'as close as lips and teeth,' as described once by Mao Zedong. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s isolation from the West has led to a deepening of relations between Moscow and Pyongyang, resulting in enhanced military cooperation between the two states. It is believed that in exchange for large amounts of North Korean munitions and ballistic missiles for Russia’s war in Ukraine, Moscow is providing North Korea with military technology, increasing Pyongyang’s military capabilities. CLOSE RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA RELATIONS POSESS A CHALLENGE TO THE WEST Beijing, a key partner of both Pyongyang and Moscow, has refrained. However, the Chinese media was quick to blame the United States claiming that its 'hostile' policy has driven Russia and North Korea closer together, thereby undermining the security situation in both regions. The Chinese portrayal of the United States as the primary instigator of tensions reflects China’s belief that Washington is its greatest threat and enemy, not Pyongyang. In response to North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile capabilities, the United States has strengthened its military cooperation with South Korea and Japan, much to China’s dismay. Beijing has long accused Washington of using the North Korean nuclear issue as a pretext to expand its military presence in the region, thereby further exacerbating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. WHAT DOES WASHINGTON WANT? Most of China’s foreign policy thinkers believe that Washington’s overall goal is not to deter North Korea but to contain China. Given that China views its foreign policy through the lens of its broader rivalry with the United States, both in Asia and globally, it is highly unlikely that Beijing will exert pressure on on either North Korea or Russia to resolve the conflicts in Northeast Asia or Europe. For China, the Kim regime remains an important buffer zone against an increasing encirclement by the U.S. and its allies, while Russia serves as an important ally in countering a U.S.-led world order. However, Beijing’s choice to not 'interfere' might, in the long run, undermine its own strategic interests. By staying on the sidelines as ties between Russia and North Korea deepen, China risks potentially exacerbating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. WITH RUSSIAN HELP CAN KIM JUNG UN DEVELOP NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES? With Russia’s help, the Kim regime is likely to accelerate the development of its nuclear capabilities. This could lead to a stronger response from the United States, and, in a worst-case scenario for Beijing, lead up to the formation of what the Chinese call a U.S.-led 'Asian NATO' aimed at targeting China. Furthermore, an emboldened North Korea increases the possibility of a more aggressive and provocative behavior, possibly stepping up its weapon testing or, even more concerning, conducting a seventh nuclear test. This inevitably would place China in a position where it is exposed to the escalation of conflicts it prefers to avoid. As a result, Beijing would face intense international pressure, particularly from the United States, to take a stronger stance against the Kim regime. DESPITE BEIJING’S TOTAL SUPPORT FOR PYOGYANG RELATIONS WITH RUSIA IS A GREAT WORRY. Despite Beijing’s economic and diplomatic support for Pyongyang, they are anything but close friends. The very fact that Kim’s first post-pandemic foreign trip was to Russia rather than China raises questions about the current state of their relationship. While Kim Jong Un has now held two summits with Putin in less than a year, Xi Jinping has not met the North Korean leader since 2019. Moreover, North Korea’s efforts to strengthen its ties with Iran further alleviate its isolation signaling a strategic attempt toward diversifying its alliances and bolstering its nuclear and ballistic missile cooperation. These new dynamics significantly complicate China’s balancing act in the region. NORTH KOREAN SOLDIERS IN WAR AGAINST UKRAINE In November 2024 Asia Policy Institute for China analysis has revealed confirmation by the White House that North Korea — a country with few allies and little money — had sent thousands of soldiers to join Russia in its war against Ukraine. Pyongyang was already supplying Moscow with weapons: according to the Times of London, half of Russia’s shells used in the war have come from North Korea. But sending personnel marks a new level of coordination. There are other signs of warming ties, too. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first trip to North Korea in over two decades. That proximity has irked China North Korea’s main backer. Chinese officials fear that Russia’s influence over the insular dictatorship is growing at China’s expense. They also worry that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will strengthen military cooperation in response to Russia and North Korea’s newfound closeness. CHINESE REACTION TO NORTH KOREA’S TRUANCY Over the past year, Beijing has chosen to react to Pyongyang’s collaboration with Moscow by publicly courting North Korea’s adversaries. For instance, in May, China held a trilateral summit with South Korea and Japan after a five-year hiatus. Coincidentally it coincided with Putin’s visit to Pyongyang. Chinese and South Korean officials held a security dialogue in Seoul — the first such meeting in nine years. CONCLUSION This seeming friction between China and North Korea has tantalized many Western security analysts, who have argued that the United States and its allies should try to drive a wedge between China and North Korea. Such an effort, however, would be futile. Despite signs of tension between the two countries, North Korea is overwhelmingly reliant on China. Nearly all of its trade, for instance, is with China. The countries have not always seen eye to eye over the past 75 years, but their relationship has never come close to splintering. Instead of focusing on what could divide North Korea from China, the United States should collaborate with the Chinese government to rein in North Korea’s volatile behavior. Both the United States and China are ultimately invested in maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula. Working together to restrain the North Korean regime is the best way to achieve it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EL-Nmm3a1kIP	2024-11-23T16:07:53-08:00	
Eni Launches Hull Of Nguya FLNG, Confirming Schedule Of Congo LNG...	Eni announced Saturday the launch of the hull of the Nguya Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility in Wison shipyard in Nantong, China. The state-of-the-art FLNG will have a liquefaction capacity of 2.4 million tons per annum (MTPA), and will complement the existing Tango FLNG, which is operational since December 2023 with a capacity of 0.6 MTPA, bringing the total liquefaction capacity of Congo LNG project to 3 MTPA by the end of 2025. The ceremony was attended by the Minister of Hydrocarbons of the Republic of Congo, Bruno Jean Richard Itoua. Guido Brusco, Eni’s Chief Operating Officer, Global Natural Resources, said: 'We celebrate this milestone together with our partners as a testament of the solid collaboration between Eni and the Republic of Congo. We have been the first to believe in the value of Congo's gas, primarily for domestic power generation, and then for export. With the successful launch of the Nguya FLNG hull, the Congo LNG Project has reached an impressive milestone of 40 million hours worked without any Lost Time Injuries. This achievement underscores the project’s ongoing progress in valorizing Congo’s gas resources, while capitalizing on local and international opportunities to deliver further value for our stakeholders'. The timely launch of the hull confirms the company’s industry-leading time-to-market performances.

Nguya FLNG has a reduced carbon footprint thanks to its design and technology, and to its zero-flaring approach, in line with Eni’s decarbonisation strategy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EBtKQwad08GZ	2024-11-23T16:06:01-08:00	
Ukrainian Archbishop Encourages Trump To Go To Ukraine	By Kate Quiñones A Ukrainian archbishop says he has encouraged President-elect Donald Trump to visit Ukraine to help 'build a policy for the future.' During a Friday interview with 'EWTN News In Depth' anchor Catherine Hadro, Archbishop Borys Gudziak of the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia said that he spoke briefly with Trump before the election at the Oct. 17 Al Smith dinner, where he encouraged Trump to visit Ukraine. Gudziak has subsequently written a letter to the president-elect to the same effect. 'I think if he went now, before the inauguration, for example, with a group of religious leaders on a humanitarian mission, he would see for himself what is happening on the ground,' Gudziak explained. 'Everybody that has gone to Ukraine — cardinals, political leaders, humanitarian workers, people who were skeptical, people that knew a lot — all came out knowing much, much more and understanding more deeply what’s happening.' 'So I would encourage President Trump to go to Ukraine,' Gudziak said, as 'a base on which to build a policy for the future.' Nov. 19 marked 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. Ukraine on Tuesday used U.S. missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory, following President Joe Biden’s authorization of such use. Russian forces shot down five of six of the missiles that were fired at a military facility. Gudziak said of the somber milestone: 'It is a time of mourning.' 'There’s great pain and great wounds in our people, in our Church,' Gudziak noted. 'At the same time, there’s great gratitude. Most observers internationally, and particularly Putin, thought Ukraine would fall in a matter of three days or three weeks. And now, three years later, the people still stand, keep standing, defending their God-given dignity, their freedom, their democracy.' Devastating toll Hundreds of thousands have been killed as a result of the Russian invasion, with more than 14 million people forced to leave their homes. The archbishop noted that 4,000 schools and 2,000 hospitals have been destroyed. 'There’s great suffering, great trauma which will be lasting,' Gudziak said. 'But there is also the sense of courage and gratitude for God’s graces that Russia has not occupied all of Ukraine and that the country is still free.' When asked what it’s like for Catholics in Ukraine, Gudziak said that 'the public life of the Catholic Church has been virtually extinguished' in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia has occupied parts of three regions. 'There [are] no Ukrainian Catholic priests functioning there now, and a couple of priests who were abducted and tortured for 18 months, who were freed in the summer — they show the scars of what Russian captivity is like,' the archbishop said. 'For Catholics, it should be clear that Russian occupation means [the] extinguishing of our normal church life,' he continued. But Gudziak noted that Catholic charities have come together to support Ukrainians, including Caritas Ukraine, a Catholic charity in Ukraine. 'Bishops and priests are in place, serving the people, celebrating the sacraments, announcing the good news, but also very much engaged in humanitarian work, helping those that have lost their homes, their possessions, distributing clothing, food, fostering medical care,' he said. 'Very importantly, the Church reminds people of their God-given dignity, the fact that the Lord is with them, that every hair on their head is counted' and that the country has lived through 'even more harrowing experiences,' he said. 'During World War II, between the Nazis and the Soviets, 6 [million] to 7 million residents of Ukraine were killed and the whole country was devastated,' Gudziak continued. 'Ukrainians know they’ve lived through the crucifixion and have resurrected in the past. So the Church announces this paschal Kerygma: We carry our cross and God will give us life.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EM7O1tblkgm4	2024-11-23T16:04:07-08:00	
Why Muslims OK Abrogated Verses In The Qur’an – OpEd	Muslims believe Allah sent tens of thousands of Prophets to all of the tribes, nations and kingdoms in the world; and 313 Messengers who like Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad, brought to their believers a special sacred book. Jews and Christians can agree to this. All prophets and their followers were Muslims (submitters to the one and only God), though Muslims do tend to conflate the general and specific meanings of the words Islam and Muslim. Five messenger prophets received scriptures from Allah prior to the Qur'an, notably the Scrolls of Abraham (now lost), the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus. Most Muslim scholars in later generations claimed that the messages and books had become corrupted or were lost. Jews and Christians strongly reject this slander because the Qur'an itself states: 'So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you (the Jews and Christians). The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (10:94) Also many Qur'an verses have been abrogated by other verses. Not all Muslims believe that the Quran abrogates itself and would reject these traditions. Yet, many Muslims do believe that the Quran abrogates itself. According to some scholars the Qur'an abrogates only the Qur'an. They base their view on verses 2:106 and 16:101. According to them the Qur'an does not abrogate the sunna (law) nor does the sunna abrogate the Qur'an. This is the view held by Shafi'i. Others claim that the Qur'an may abrogate the Qur'an as well as the sunnah (law). They base their view on Sura 53:3-4 The Muslim scholar Ahmad Von Denffer said regarding the conflicting views held by Muslim scholars over the precise nature of abrogation: 'The number of verses that are considered to have been abrogated increased dramatically between the eighth and eleventh centuries (al-Zuhri mentions 42 abrogated verses, al-Nahhas 138, and Ibn Salama, 238), at which point an upper limit seems to have been reached (Ibn 'Ata'iqi identifies 231 abrogated verses, and al-Farsi, 248). Yet 'al-Suyuti (died 1505 CE) recognized only twenty instances of true abrogation, and Shah Wali Allah (died 1762 CE) reduced that number to five. Here is a good example from: SAHIH BUKHARI Volume 6, Book 60, Number 13: Narrated Al-Bara: The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he (really) wished that his Qibla would be the Ka'ba (at Mecca). (So Allah revealed verse (2:144) and he Prophet Muhammad) offered 'Asr prayers (in his Mosque facing Ka'ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. 'A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, 'I testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.' Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka'ba while they were still bowing. 'Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka'ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:-- 'Allah would never make your faith (prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem are holy). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.' (2.143) The many dozens of Prophets in the Hebrew Bible make only a few references to the religious texts of prior religions. The New Testament is an add on to the Hebrew Bible; which quotes the Hebrew Bible 302+ times, and claims to be the Old Tenement's fulfillment. The Qur'an is a stand alone text which mentions both Torah and Injil together 12 times, mentions Injil three times, and Torah six times by themselves; and quotes the Zabur only once (Psalm 37:9,11,29) in Qur'an 21:105. The term suhuf (scrolls Qur'an 20:133, 21:48, 87:19) is used for texts of Prophets Abraham, Aaron and Moses which were written separately, and later added in as part of the Oral Torah written down by the rabbis in the second century. (Qur'an 6:91) This was the original meaning of Tahrif. At first it would seem that Tahrif (Arabic: تحريف, 'distortion, alteration') an Arabic term used by Muslims for the alterations which Islamic tradition claims Jews and Christians have made to their revealed books, specifically the Tawrat (Torah), Zabur (Psalms) and Injil (Gospels); is the direct opposite of Midrash. In the Zabur of Prophet David it is written: 'One thing God has spoken; two things have I heard' (Psalms 62:12). The rabbis in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 34a) asserted that this means there are multiple interpretations of each verse of Scripture that can be correct, and the word of God, even if they contradict one another. The Hebrew term for this concept of pluralistic interpretation of sacred scriptures is Midrash. Midrash (מדרשׁ) is an interpretive activity of seeking answers to religious questions (both practical and spiritual) by plumbing the meaning of every word in the Torah. In the Bible, the root d-r-sh [דרשׁ] means inquiring into any matter, including seeking out God's word. Midrash responds to contemporary problems and crafts new narratives, making connections between new Jewish realities and the ancient unchanging Hebrew text. Midrash falls into two categories.When the subject is law and religious practice (halacha ), it is called Midrash halacha. Midrash aggadah, on the other hand, interprets biblical poetry, prophecy and narrative, exploring questions of ethics or theology, and creating lessons, new insights and different views all based on the ancient text. In some ways Midrash is like Islamic Tafsir, meaning 'to discover'. Tafsir is the explanation or interpretation of something 'exposing its secrets. Written by rabbis steeped in the Bible and absorbed by the many different questions that arise over the centuries, midrash occupies the meeting ground between reverence and love for the word of the fixed text of the Torah, and religious creativity in meeting new developments in society and culture. Midrash thus yields religious insights that have made Torah directly applicable to the later realities of Jewish life. The best-known rabbinic midrash is the legend of Prophet Abraham, who as a young child in Mesopotamia smashed his father's idols. Not just a simple morality tale about a national hero, the text in Midrash Rabbah for Genesis suggests that Abraham's selection by God did not come out of nowhere, as Genesis 12 literally reads. Rather, Abraham had independently come to a point where he would be receptive to the voice of the one God. This midrash lays out Prophet Abraham's relationship to his family and to the people and culture around him, and his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. It is not only a depiction of this patriarch, but also a model of an ideal spiritual personality for Jews, Christians and Muslims in any age and foreign culture. The narrative about Abraham breaking his father's idols is related in the Qur'an once in 19:41-50 and again in 21:51-66 for a total of 24 verses. In the written Torah this event is not mentioned at all; but it is the center of several oral Torah Midrash accounts. This would be called Tahrif by Muslims; and is called Midrash by Jews, but if you ask most Jews today, especially well educated Jews who are less educated in Judaism, where the Abraham breaking his father's idols event is related; they will respond it is written in the Book of Genesis in the Torah. So the Qur'an states: 'And there is a party among them who twist their tongues while reciting the [Torah] Book to make you think that it [their Midrash/Tafsir] is part of the Book, when in fact it is not. They say: 'It is from Allah', when in fact it is not from Allah. They falsely fix a lie upon Allah, and do so wittingly.' (3:78) As a Reform Rabbi I agree with the above ayah. The party the Qur'an criticizes are those Orthodox Rabbis, who when the subject was law and religious practice (Midrash halacha) kept expanding the number of dietary laws, the strictness of Sabbath restrictions, and female purity laws. Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, 'Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So do not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded.' (Bukhari Vol. 1, Book 2, # 38) Reform Rabbis regard the increasingly restrictive developments in the laws of kosher diet, especially for Passover, as a counterproductive, overburdening of the Jewish people by extra-pious Orthodox rabbis. The expansion of restrictions on Shabbat activities is also seen by Reform Rabbis as a counterproductive, overburdening of the joy of Shabbat. The Qur'an wisely differentiates between extremism and striving to be near perfect (no one is perfect) which involves a rejection of extremism. Just trying to do well will be rewarded. Religion should not be hard. Making religion easier does not mean making religion soft or impious. This is a very important Hadith because all religions have believers that think that more is always better, and that much harder is still better.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EDxQzcghq1AP	2024-11-23T16:02:17-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Challenges Of Financial Realignmen...	In a Visual Capitalist report of September 17th, 2024, it was noted that the US Dollar dominates the world reserve currencies at 59%. It is followed by the Euro at 20%, the Japanese Yen at 6% and the British Pound at 5%. All other currencies followed with smaller shares, indicating that despite the great fanfare of BRICS Plus, most reserves are still held in the West’s major currencies. The above four currencies control some 90% of world currency reserves. The Chinese Renminbi held only 2% while all the others together held some 8% of the US$ 11.5 trillion of global reserves. The US Dollar’s share came down from 70% in 2000 but nevertheless remains the main currency of reserves in the world. It is expected to continue in this leading position in the decades to come, although there is a growing usage of non-traditional reserves, such as the Chinese Renminbi. The BRICS Plus countries are the biggest holders of most non-traditional currencies and mostly the Chinese Renminbi, which contributed some 25% of the shift away from the US Dollar. We will attempt to address in this article the impact of the shifting away from the US Dollar or the impact of the BRICS Plus on the Horn of Africa States region. The region is one of the poorest in the world and when it comes to volumes, nothing much will happen to the issue of reserves. Indeed, the region has no impact on what happens on the world’s reserves at present. Ethiopia has the largest reserves in the region with only a minuscule US$ 3 billion including gold, as of 2020, as reported by the World Bank earlier in this month of November 2024. However, when it comes to politicking and the challenges of the region, there appears to be reasons to watch. Ethiopia earlier this year embarked on challenging Somalia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty as a nation by signing an illegal MoU with one of the regions of country without going through the Federal authorities of the country. Somalia’s reaction was severe and quickly and forcefully defended its territorial integrity through all the diplomatic channels available to it. This included among other seeking help from other countries like Türkiye and Egypt to defend the country’s lands and waters from the blatant invasion, expelled Ethiopia’s ambassador and refused to include Ethiopia in the AUSOM force of the African Union to be deployed in the country after the mandate of the ATMIS force ends on December 31st, 2024. The world held its breath during the whole year and scrambled to avoid a physical war between the two countries. The irony is that two new members of the BRICS Plus countries include Egypt and Ethiopia, which have their own difficulties on the issue of the Blue Nile and the GERD built by Ethiopia on the river. Ethiopia has not so far moved into the realization of the illegal MoU and since then, there was a change of governance in the Somali region, which was forced to sign the MoU by the Ethiopian administration. Somalia has not yet taken other steps which could include suspension of Ethiopian Airlines flights to the country or overflights in Somalia’s airspace, which is vast or other more serious actions that may adversely affect Ethiopia without firing a shot of its own. Ethiopia is currently undergoing one of the most serious not only financial difficulties but also existential threats. The IMF and the World Bank have recently organized extending some conditioned financial assistance for the country, but this may not help in the ethnic-based conflicts in the country. The war in the Amhara State, the OLA war, the Tigray war shimmering under the ashes, the Afar Somali states continuing war, the attempts of the Oromia state to move on to the Somali State and the antagonistic relations the country has developed with all the neighboring countries, all point to a country barely surviving and trying to export its woes to others. Somalia, another fragile country in the region, appears to have been its main target and hence the illegal MoU. Negotiations between Somalia and Ethiopia was organized by the international community and Türkiye played the central role in this respect, but these negotiations have brought any good results fruits, so far, with Ethiopia still insisting on proceeding with the materialization of the MoU. It is not clear whether the new administration of the Somali region, which changed hands recently through a well-organized election process, will follow the policies of the old administration or not. However, there is reason to believe that it would not and would change priorities to meet the needs of its population. This may lead to a more stable region, which will step back from the brink of war. It is most unfortunate that the Ethiopian regime has underestimated the Somali resolve to defend their territories at all costs, including the large Somali population within Ethiopia who number anywhere between twenty-five to thirty million people, although the fake statistics given by the Ethiopian government does not report this. How does one read the Ethiopian BRICS adventure and the region? In this respect, one must note that the West where the Bretton Woods multilateral financial organizations of the World Bank and the IMF are rooted, would vehemently oppose this ill-thought of move on the part of Ethiopia. This is a direct assault on these institutions, which are economically and financially competing with the Chinese BRI project and other financial institutions. It is not clear what the intentions of the arrangements of the two organizations with Ethiopia are or represent. The move of Ethiopia to the BRICS may, however, lead Somalia to move closer to the West. Note the region overlooks a major shipping route connecting Asia, Africa and Europe. It is also reported to own vast natural resources including oil and gas, which seems to have been identified most recently by the Turkish Exploration ship Oruc Reis. If one has already arrangements with the country that owns the longest coast in the region, would there be a need to create new and unpredictable processes such as the Ethiopian forced MoU with one of the regions of Somalia imply? It is clear that Ethiopia is being used by outsider forces. The United Arab Emirates, which has substantial interests in the region is generally reported to be behind the adventure story of Ethiopia as financiers and political backers. Ethiopia, a poor nation grappling with its multitude of problems would not venture into such a major project, some say. The UAE is already in Berbera, a major port of Somalia in the north but does not trust the owners of the port, Somalis and it is why it is pushing, some say, Ethiopia to launch the search for a port in Somali waters and take over Somali territories. Both the UAE and Ethiopia and eventually the BRICS seem to be underestimating the Somali despite the weaknesses in Somali governance. What they do not know is that Somalis are generally better Somalis when foreigners invade their country, and as families, they all congregate to defend the home. The oil and gas potential recently discovered in the country and its seas would generally provide the financial needs of the country and money is what counts in the world of today. Somalia is already improving and rebuilding its land, air and naval forces and its relations with the West is expected to be a wall against the adventures of BRICS Plus and its ally, Ethiopia, an economically small country with not much to contribute.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EOFb4avN7oh8	2024-11-23T16:00:52-08:00	
Facing Armageddon And Yajuj-Majuj With Hope And Faith -OpEd	More than seven percent of all deaths in 10 of India's biggest cities are linked to air pollution. Smog-filled Indian cities like Delhi suffer from some of the world's worst air pollution, with 12,000 annual deaths linked to air pollution. An international study involving 52 researchers from around the world found that one in every five species of reptiles on earth is facing extinction. Out of 10,196 reptile species covered by the research, close to 2,000 species are in danger of dying out, said the authors of the study, the first of its kind to address the issue on such a large scope. The word Armageddon does not appear in the Hebrew Bible, and appears only once in the Greek New Testament, in Revelation 16:16 which makes no mention of armies being predicted to one day gather on or near Mount Megiddo; but instead seems to predict only that 'they (will gather) the kings together to ... Armageddon'. We know now that oil, gas and coal are the kings of global warming. The book of Revelation text does seem to imply, based on the text from an earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the 'place called Armageddon' is 'for the war of the great day of God Almighty' which is now seen as the ongoing battle against Global Warming. The Madhi himself may already have been born. Yajuj and Majuj are mentioned both in Qur'an and hadith. In Islam their appearance will be one of the signs of the end times. These events will transpire after the arrival of Dajjal, Mahdi and Prophet Jesus. Gog and Magog ('Gog u-Magog' in Hebrew and 'Yajuj and Majuj' in Arabic) are names that appear in the Hebrew Bible, and in the Qur'an. They are sometimes personified as individuals, and sometimes identified as nations or as geographic regions: but all references in Bible, Qur'an and Hadith (oral and then written tradition) clearly indicate that they are very numerous in number, and will appear from the north toward the end of times, before the Day of Judgement: 'They said, 'O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are [great] corrupters in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make a barrier between us and them?' (Qur'an 18:94) —[Dhul-Qarnayn] said, 'This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it level, and ever true is the promise of my Lord. And We will leave them that day surging over each other, and [when] the Horn will be blown, We will assemble them in [one] assembly.' (18:98-99) A Hadith transmitted by both Imam Al- Bukhari and Imam Muslim, on the authority of Zainab Bint Jahsh relates that Prophet Muhammad once came to her in a state of fear and said: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. Woe unto the Arabs from a danger that has come near. An opening has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this,' making a circle with his thumb and index finger. Zainab Bint Jahsh said: 'O Allah's Messenger! Shall we be destroyed even though there are pious persons among us?' He said: 'Yes, when evil persons will increase.' In 2011 the 'Arab Spring' filled most of the world with great hopes. Now, 13 years later, the near east is filled with increasing conflict, anxiety, fear, and despair. According to a worldwide poll for Reuters (May 2, 2012) 'nearly 15 percent of people worldwide believe the world will end during their lifetime'. That number is surely much higher by now. 'Whether they think it [the world] will come to an end through the hands of God, or a natural disaster or political events, whatever the reason, one in seven thinks the end of the world is coming,' said Keren Gottfried, research manager at Ipsos Global Public Affairs which conducted the poll for Reuters. Why are so many people so negative and pessimistic about the future of humanity While it is true that human society has changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last 200 years than ever before in human history, humanity has already survived several major revolutions and world wars. Doctors today save the lives of millions; while dictators sacrifice the lives of millions. Populations are exploding in Africa and populations are declining in Europe. Technology produces both worldwide prosperity and worldwide pollution at the same time. Should we look upon the 21st century with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation? Is the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday? Or are both occurring almost concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? The long tradition of trying to foresee the distant, eventual goal of human history started with the Prophets of Israel over 2.700 years ago. The Biblical vision of a Messianic Age may provide us with guidance in understanding the social, economic, scientific and cultural upheavals that will sweep society as it approaches the next stage. Often, it is the dramatic dangers of the pre-Messianic tribulation that are emphasized in Christian, Islamic and Jewish post scriptural traditions. I will focus on the positive signs developing throughout the world that accord with the Messianic vision of the Biblical Prophets.In most religious traditions, redemption is defined in terms of individual enlightenment or personal salvation. However, the Prophets of Israel conceived of redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of a transformation of the Jewish people. This will take place in this world at some future time. Is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her own religion, that would itself bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps. As the Qur'an states, 'Accountability for mankind is getting closer and closer, yet they are heedless and turn away.' (Al-Anbiya 1 and Al-Qamar 1-8) God of course, is always ready to help us defeat evil, if we are ready to work for the establishment of a just and peaceful local and world society; that is why one or more Messiahs will come. A Messiah is a human agent of God who helps bring about this transformation. This agent of God (with several forerunners and many disciples) will be a person with great leadership qualities; similar to Prophets Moses or Muhammad. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Messianic Age is usually seen as the solution to all of humanity's basic problems. This may be true in the long run, but the vast changes the transition to the Messianic Age entails, will provide challenges to society for many generations to come. For example, the Prophet Isaiah, 2,700 years ago, predicted that someday there would be a radically new world in which Jerusalem would be filled with joy for 'no more shall there be in it an infant that lives only a few days.' (65:20) A century ago, the infant mortality rate in Jerusalem (as in most of the world) was 25-30%. Now, infant mortality is less than 1%. For thousands of years almost every family in the world suffered the loss of at least one or two infants; now it happens to less than one out of a hundred. Truly we are close to Isaiah's prophecy, 'One who dies at 100 years shall be reckoned a youth, and one who fails to reach 100 shall be reckoned accursed.' (65:20). Such radical change will necessitate major changes in the way we think and act when faced with decisions about life and death. Yet who among us would want to return to the high mortality rates and early deaths of previous centuries? The fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy has thus gone unnoticed and uncelebrated. If you had told Soviet Jews a generation ago that the Communist regime would collapse, the Soviet Empire disintegrate, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews would emigrate to Israel, they would have conceived it only as a Messianic dream. In our own generation therefore we have seen the dramatic fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy: 'I will bring your offspring from the (Middle) East and gather you from the (European) West. To the North (Russia) I will say 'give them up' and to the South (Ethiopia) 'do not hold them'. Bring my sons from far away, my daughters from the end of the earth.' (43:5-6) Isn't it amazing how people adjust to living in a radically new world and forget the past. Indeed, the Prophet Isaiah himself said, 'Behold, I create a new Heaven and a new Earth, and former things shall not be remembered.' (65:17) Where does the Messiah fit in with all of this? He will still have lots to do when he arrives. Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a small Jewish house of worship 'hologram', which is a 3D projection created with lasers, could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock and 600 feet north of the Al-Aksa Mosque, provided that Muslims would agree to cooperate. Anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important, and anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, Jewish/Christian/Muslim agreements establishing world wide peace would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each Jewish-Christian-Muslim community could consider its leadership to be essentially Messianic, Indeed, such Jewish-Christian-Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its own leadership to be essential Messianic aids as is foretold: ('Saviors [plural] will come up on mount Zion' Obadiah 1:21) and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Micah (4:3-5): 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk, each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings; the Messianic Age of world wide peace will surely have arrived, and then-and only then-will the Temple of Solomon be rebuilt, and God's Holy Kingdom established on earth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgiF6TA5H1EJfa9AtxhdHe	2024-11-23T15:54:50-08:00	
Ukraine Military Situation: Russian Forces Unleash Massive Barrag...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Biden Administration Eases Restrictions on Use of US-Provided Weapons In a major development, the Biden administration gave Ukraine permissionto use American long-range weaponry, particularly the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to strike military targets inside Russia. Subsequently, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that France and the United Kingdom had followed suit by allowing Ukraine to use SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles for the same purpose, though the publication revised that reportshortly after its release to indicate that London and Paris were only engaging in 'debates' on the question. Press sources report that Washington may still be limiting Kyiv’s use of American munitions to targets relevant to Ukraine’s Kursk incursion. Regardless, the Biden administration’s decision to remove the restraints came not a moment too soon. The Ukrainian Armed Forces need to target Russia’s strategic depth, particularly critical military basing structures and force groupings in assembly areas. Depending on its warhead configuration and variant, the ATACMS is well-suited for this role. 2. North Korean Heavy Artillery Spotted in Russia Geolocated open-source imagery identified North Korean M1989 Koksan 170mm self-propelled howitzers on Russian railways near Krasnoyarsk last week, indicating that Pyongyang has stepped up its tactical support for the Kremlin. These North Korean systems are formidable, as artillery has traditionally determined the conventional military balance on the Korean Peninsula. Declassified field assessments conclude that Pyongyang possesses dangerous fire-support capabilities, and the United States Defense Intelligence Agencyhas determined that North Korea’s massed artillery and special forces units pose a significant threat to South Korea. Of all its artillery systems, Pyongyang’s 170mm-class self-propelled howitzers and 240mm-class heavy multiple-launch rocket systems are the most powerful. The 170mm Koksan howitzer has an operational range of 37 miles and can unleash an initial burst of four rounds in one minute, followed by one round every three minutes. It is designed to fire from protected areas and relocate for reloading. Pyongyang has hundreds of Koksan guns in its arsenal and can afford to send a significant number to the Kremlin. What remains unknown is whether North Korea is sending its artillery systems to support Russian units or to augment its own 10,000-strong 11th Corps detachments in the Russian region of Kursk. While open-source intelligence is thus far limited, it is distinctly possible that the North Korean 11th Corps is only the vanguard of a larger follow-on force. 3. Boosting Ukraine’s Growing F-16 Fleet In recent weeks the Biden administration has worked to boost the capabilities of Ukraine’s burgeoning F-16 fighter aircraft fleet. The Pentagon has permitted American defense contractors to operate in Ukraine so weapons systems that Washington has transferred to Kyiv can be maintained and repaired in country. This decision will make US-made F-16s and Patriot strategic air and missile defense systems much easier for Ukraine to use. The United States has also provided the Ukrainian Air Force with an intensive F-16 training program in Arizona, further enhancing Ukraine’s air warfare capabilities. Of Ukraine’s European partners, the Netherlands and Denmark have contributed the most to Kyiv’s F-16 deterrent. Belgium and Norway have also pledged to supply Kyiv with the fighter aircraft, so Ukraine will soon possess over 90 F-16s and may be able to operate two squadrons by 2025. Notably, the Dutch F-16s are Viper Midlife Upgrade variants, which means they have additional precision-guided munitions certifications, better cockpit systems, more capable sensors, and software modernizations that are roughly aligned with the Block 50/52 standards for US-made F-16s. This is particularly important for Ukraine because the fighter aircraft derives much of its combat prowess from the weapons systems and external pods it is equipped with. Kyiv’s air deterrent may also be receiving a boost from Greece. Press sources have claimed that Athens, in retaliation for a Russian missile strike on Odesa during Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s visit to the city, had decided to send its decommissioned, older F-16 variants to Ukraine after refurbishing them in the United States. While this has not yet occurred, the Greek and Ukrainian governments have agreed on the provision of training and technical support for Ukraine’s F-16 fleet. Ukraine’s F-16s have had a mixed record in combat roles. They have been used primarily to shoot down Russian drones and cruise missiles. In August 2024 Russian aircraft downed a Ukrainian F-16 and killed its pilot. While some sources have reported that a Ukrainian F-16 downed a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber, that incident has never been confirmed. Regardless, protecting Ukrainian airspace will remain a key priority as Kyiv and its partners defend against continued Russian aggression. 4. Battlefield Assessment Last week saw a devastating rise in the number of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine. During the night of November 17, the Russian military unleashed a salvo of 42 loitering munitions and 102 missiles, its largest in many months. The attack targeted Ukraine’s energy network in major cities including Kyiv. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, Russia used one Zircon hypersonic missile and one Kinzhal aeroballistic missile in the barrage. The air component of the strike package involved nuclear-capable Tu-160 and Tu-95 strategic bombers and Tu-22M3 tactical bombers, along with other tactical military aviation assets. Ukrainian officials reported civilian casualties across the country in addition to the damage to energy facilities. Despite major political developments, only moderate changes in the battlefield geometry occurred last week. Augmented by North Korean forces, the Russian military pressed to recapture the territory it has lost to Ukrainian forces in Kursk before the Trump administration takes office. In the east, Ukraine’s lines of defense remained overstretched, allowing the Russian campaign to maintain a costly but steady pace. At other flashpoints, including Kurakhove, Pokrovsk, Chasiv Yar, Kupiansk, Klishchiivka, and Velyka Novosilka, Russian combat formations gained territory at the tactical level. Ukraine’s drone warfare prowess also continued to influence the conflict. Ukrainian drone strikes against Russian air defense assets increased, a trend worth monitoring. Russia also erected new defensive structures to protect the Kerch Bridge, which connects occupied Crimea to mainland Russia, from Ukrainian naval drones. A previous Hudson studyassessed Kyiv’s military options for striking this tactically and symbolically significant bridge.

Beijing Grows Anxious Over Internationalization Of Cross-Strait R...	By Yi-Chuan Chiu Four days after Taiwan’s National Day on 10 October 2024, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launched another large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, dubbed ‘Joint Sword-2024B’. While Taiwanese and US officials condemned these drills as ‘military provocations’, China’s justification included a phrase key to understanding Beijing’s anxiety about recent tensions in the Taiwan Strait— ‘the internationalisation of the Taiwan issue’. The term reflects Beijing and Taipei’s different views of the status quo and how this complicates cross-strait dynamics. ‘Internationalisation’ refers to framing China–Taiwan relations as a state-to-state relationship and an international dispute open to third-party intervention. Though the term originated in the 1950s, it resurfaced in Chinese official discourse when Beijing resisted comparisons between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. Such rejections reflect Beijing’s long-standing assertion that Taiwan belongs to China, is an unresolved issue of the Chinese Civil War and that solving the issue in any way is a domestic Chinese matter. Beijing’s disdain for internationalisation has been repeatedly quoted in its justification for launching PLA exercises protesting Taiwanese President Lai Ching-Te’s inauguration speech in May 2024 and National Day address in October. Lai’s speeches sought to frame cross-strait relations as state-to-state, which differed from the cautious approach of his predecessor, Tsai Ing-Wen. Unlike Tsai’s inaugural speeches in 2016 and 2020, Lai did not pledge to manage cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. These documents nominally commit to unification while also portraying cross-strait relations as an area-to-area relationship rather than a typical foreign relationship. Tsai referenced these legal texts to circumvent Beijing’s ‘One China Principle’ while seeking political common ground. She also referred to the governments in Beijing and Taipei as ‘both sides’ instead of using official country names. Lai’s citation of the ROC Constitution aimed to assert that Taiwan is an independent sovereign country and that ‘the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China are not subordinate to each other’. While Lai’s claim partly originated from Tsai’s 2021 National Day address, Beijing has criticised it as a new two-state theory and a disguisedpursuit of Taiwanese independence. Lai’s cross-strait approach indicates a priority for broadening domestic support rather than engaging Beijing. Most Taiwanese prefer a distinct Taiwanese identity without formally declaring independence. Lai intends to unify Taiwanese advocating for Taiwanese independence and those valuing the legacy of the ROC, which originated in mainland China. He has asserted that the 75-year-old People’s Republic of China (PRC) could not be the motherland of the 113-year-old ROC. Lai’s claim was condemned by Beijing as absurd but supported by 57 per cent of Taiwanese. Lai’s sharp rhetoric to carve Taiwan out of China not only reflects his self-defined pragmatismtowards Taiwanese independence, but also shows that Taiwanese politicians are constrained by the status quo preferred by the Taiwanese electorate. Most Taiwanese prefer to maintain de facto independence under the ROC banner and reframing cross-strait relations under an ambiguous One China concept — like the 1992 Consensus — is unpopular. Taiwan’s idea of the status quo differs from Beijing’s. Beijing’s ideal of the status quo stresses that most countries have de-recognised the ROC to formalise relations with the PRC. Therefore, Beijing finds it unacceptable for other countries to show diplomatic support for Taipei, especially when Taipei seeks to resist unification with Beijing. Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation benefits Beijing’s multifaceted campaign to coerce Taipei into unification and keep the Taiwan issue a domestic matter. This includes denying the Taiwan Strait’s status as international waters, increasing Chinese maritime patrols near Taiwanese territory and renewing efforts to reinterpret the United Nations’ resolution 2758. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, Beijing refused Tsai’s cross-strait engagement proposal — which lacked a direct mention of the 1992 Consensus — and has been unilaterally pushing for unificationunder the PRC. This has led to a cycle of action and reaction where both sides fear that ambiguity would either formalise continued separation or lead to forced unification. It is a difficult balancing act for Beijing to counter internationalisation while deterring Taiwanese independence with military means. On the one hand, Beijing aims to repel Western accusations of China as a systemic rival or revisionist power. Consequently, Chinese rhetoric has sought to characterise the One China Principle as an international norm integral to the post-World War II global order. On the other hand, massive PLA drills have the countereffect of drawing global attention to Taiwan. Other countries are likely uninterested in the contentious debate over the nuances of cross-strait terminology, but would be concerned about Beijing’s appetite for wielding its military power. The Chinese threat of war has so far deterred Taipei from abandoning the ROC name and establishing a Taiwanese republic. Yet it fails to dim Taiwanese aspirations for international participation and cannot force a Chinese identity on Taiwanese voters. Though cross-strait divergence is deepening, whether another Taiwan Strait crisis will happen depends on US actions. Unable to change Taiwanese public opinion in the short term, Beijing is more concerned about Washington amplifyinginternationalisation. Under President Joe Biden, former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit in August 2022 triggered massive PLA exercises but heightened Taiwan’s international visibility. Washington has also continuously raised international concerns about Taiwan Strait stability with US allies. With US President-elect Donald Trump’s isolationist and transactional style returning to the White House, it is uncertain whether Biden’s Taiwan approach will continue. Symbolic gestures that might trigger another military crisis and Beijing’s requests to change US language regarding Taiwan must be treated cautiously if the second Trump administration intends to keep the fragile cross-strait balance.

Trump 2.0 And The Indo-Pacific: Balancing Economic And Security I...	By Abhishek Sharma and Sayantan Haldar The United States (US) elections have come to a close, with Donald Trump emerging as the winner of the White House race. World-over, speculation is rife about the shifts in global geopolitics that the new Trump administration will likely usher in. Donald Trump’s previous stint in Washington as the 45th President of the United States (between 2017-2021) is helpful for analysts in drawing clues about the priorities and interests of his incoming administration. However, the state of the world has changed dramatically since Trump’s previous term in office and is likely to be reflected in his government’s actions going forward. While it is natural that the incoming administration will change how the US continues to engage with the world, in the Indo-Pacific context, the shifts are likely to be nuanced. On the economic front, the intensification of a contest against China may be on the horizon. In many ways, this will shape Washington’s security outlook in the Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacific legacy of Trump 1.0 In many ways, Donald Trump formalised America’s position on the Indo-Pacific. The previous Trump administration presided over America’s shift from the erstwhile Asia-Pacific towards a broader ‘Indo-Pacific’ focus. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, sought to anchor Washington’s defence, economic, and diplomatic ties with maritime Asia through the ‘Pivot’ strategy, later rechristened the ‘Rebalance to Asia’ strategy. Much after, world leaders began to grapple with the need to unify two important oceans—the Indian and Pacific oceans—into a single strategic theatre. In 2018, the Trump administration renamed the erstwhile Hawaii-based US Pacific Command (USPACOM) to the US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). While much of Trump’s campaign leading up to his previous administration was built on the need to check US spending on its allies and partners, the previous Trump administration had done well in gathering momentum towards building partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. This partly resulted from the imminent threat of China’s rise and the need to contain Beijing’s unilateral actions, which posed significant risks to American strategic interests in the region. Importantly, it was under the Trump administration, in 2017, that the Foreign Ministers of the four Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) countries—Australia, India, Japan and the US—held talks for the first time, which paved the way for the group to emerge as a formidable platform for governance in key domains of the Indo-Pacific. However, the strategic realities of the Indo-Pacific have undergone significant shifts in the last few years. This has also propelled new American partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. Apart from the Quad, three key partnerships guiding Washington’s outlook towards the Indo-Pacific are: The trilateral security cooperation with South Korea and Japan; Squad comprising US, Japan, Australia, and Philippines; and AUKUS comprising Australia, the United Kingdom (UK), and the US. While the US-Japan-South Korea trilateral seeks to address security challenges posed by North Korea, the Squad took shape recently in response to continued Chinese belligerence in the South China Sea, which often led to physical confrontations between various maritime services of China and the Philippines. Meanwhile, AUKUS emerged as a trilateral to deliver nuclear-powered submarines to Australia to deter potential conflict in an increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific. Given the shifting regional geopolitical landscape, the question of how the new Trump administration recalibrates its security and foreign policy is likely to be tied to the way Washington views the utility of its labyrinth partnerships in its pursuit of national interests. Strategic competition to strategic contestation The incoming Trump administration will inherit a robust security 'latticework' established by the Joe Biden administration in the Indo-Pacific. It is uncertain if the initiatives seeded and nurtured by Biden's ‘Diplomacy First’ approach will be continued with the same diplomatic rigour in the Trump administration. The answer to this will likely shape the trajectory of the US’s Indo-Pacific approach. The future of minilateral partnerships is likely to remain subject to the merits of Trump’s transactional diplomacy. It is quite evident that US foreign policy will be dominated by Trump’s priorities and interests. However, based on the Trump 2.0 cabinet appointments, a trade war with China appears certain. This will spill over into Washington’s approach towards the Indo-Pacific and the way US alliances and partnerships are sustained, which might play out adversely for the US-led security architecture. Due to the Trump administration’s great emphasis on economic issues related to China, security considerations will likely take a back seat. The ensuing economic sentiment in Washington is a factor that will heavily influence Trump 2.0 diplomacy. The trade war against China that started during his first tenure will likely resume and sharpen. In this context, the US’s traditional allies in the Indo-Pacific will need to recalibrate their strategies to ensure their security interests remain unhindered. Drawing from their experiences with the previous Trump administration, the election results seem to have spurred concerns about the future of a US-led security architecture in the Indo-Pacific, especially with regards to Washington’s allies’ place in the new American outlook towards the region. Consequently, whether the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will remain the focal point of US Indo-Pacific Strategy is still unclear. Moreover, the incoming of the new Trump administration might lead to the proliferation of more minilaterals in the Indo-Pacific, especially if Washington neglects or discontinues security cooperation, allowing emerging and middle powers to step up and cooperate. For instance, during Trump 1.0, Japan under Shinzo Abe took the initiative to continue engaging and reassuring regional stakeholders like the Southeast Asian countries, keeping initiatives like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) alive, while also managing China’s economic profile in the Indo-Pacific. Conclusion The incoming Trump administration is expected to be more hawkish towards China than Trump 1.0, shifting from Biden’s approach of managed competition to more open confrontation. This will lead to an intensified contest between the US and China in the Indo-Pacific, which, going forward, will also shape its Indo-Pacific policy and relations with regional stakeholders. Nonetheless, what remains to be seen is whether the US approach towards China will remain the dominant factor shaping its relations with regional allies in the Indo-Pacific, or whether earlier friction points of the Trump 1.0 era will re-emerge in the US foreign policy agenda. Either of the two scenarios will significantly alter the Indo-Pacific regional security and economic architecture. For instance, the US is expected to revert to its earlier mercantilist position on the economic front, so we will likely see the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) becoming dormant, giving more space to Beijing. However, on the security front, it is expected that Trump will continue to invest in minilateral security groupings like AUKUS and Quad. In the Indo-Pacific, a major concern will be whether the US will continue to seek a leadership role as it did during the Biden administration through a ‘relentless diplomacy’ approach, or whether it will be content with pursuing its ‘America First’ agenda in the Indo-Pacific.

Elderly Care Service Industry In China’s Silver Economy Has Enorm...	By Qian Xiaozhi In recent years, the Chinese authorities have been looking into the issue of health consumption in public health and livelihoods. The introduction and implementation of a series of policies, such as the Healthy China 2030 (HC 2030), have become powerful tools for promoting nationwide health. Such policies focus on the future development goals for the country's health industry, with particular attention to the market size and positioning of the 'big health' industry. The 'big health' industry is an extension of the health concept. It covers a wide range of human activities related to food, clothing, housing, transportation, aging, illness, and death. It spans the entire lifecycle, from disease prevention and diagnosis to treatment, care, and health management. According to the HC 2030, it is expected that by the year 2030, the market size of China's 'big health' industry will reach RMB 16 trillion where the sector has seen rapid growth since 2018. According to data from Intelligent Research Group, in 2023, the market size of China's big health industry grew to RMB 77.127 trillion; among which the health and elderly care sector accounted for RMB 31.357 trillion, making up more than 40% of the total. This indicates that with the increasing aging population, elderly care in China has become an important component of the big health industry. Furthermore, based on the forecasts of HC 2030 and the current estimates of the industry's scale, it is expected that in the next 6 to 7 years, the market size of China's big health industry will double. The rapid increase in market size is primarily due to the booming demand from current societal factors. A report from the World Bank highlights that chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases, have become China's top health threats, with the proportion of deaths from these diseases exceeding 80%, and the share of the national disease burden reaching 68.6%. Chronic diseases have now replaced infectious diseases as the primary health concern of the Chinese population. According to relevant data, the prevalence rate of chronic diseases among China's total population is 169.8 per 1,000, while among the elderly population is 540.3 per 1,000, which is 3.2 times the national average. As the elderly care sector expands, the related service industry plays an increasingly important role. Based on daily observations by researchers at ANBOUND, there are several areas within the Chinese elderly care service industry that may hold potential for further development.: 1. Specialized Medical Food: Dr. Wei Junmin, a chief physician at Beijing Hospital, noted that based on a nationwide survey, over 40% of individuals aged 60 and above face nutritional risks or malnutrition. In hospitals, more than half of elderly inpatients are at nutritional risk, and about 30% are malnourished. With substantial market potential, specialized medical food is expected to experience rapid growth. According to a report on market trends of medical food for 2023-2024 by iiMedia Research, the global market for specialized medical food grew from RMB 58.3 billion in 2014 to RMB 89.64 billion in 2022, and it is projected to exceed RMB 100 billion by 2027, reaching RMB 111.06 billion. The market size of China's specialized medical food industry grew from RMB 2.59 billion in 2016 to RMB 11.93 billion in 2022. iiMedia analysts believe that only 1.6% of malnourished patients in China consume specialized medical food, which is significantly lower than the 65% rate in the U.S. With factors such as population aging, increasing downstream demand, and the development of hospital nutrition departments, the specialized medical food sector is expected to see further growth due to its crucial role in clinical nutritional support. 2. Elderly care travels: In the criteria set by the China Silver Industry Association (CSIA), travel-based elderly care is defined as a lifestyle where elderly individuals travel and reside in towns outside their usual place of residence for more than 15 days, during which they enjoy various age-friendly services and continue their elderly care. According to a June 2023 report by the China Tourism Academy, it is estimated that by the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), the number of younger, healthier elderly individuals who travel frequently and have higher tourism consumption will exceed 100 million. Tourism revenue from elderly people in China is expected to reach RMB 1.14 trillion. The report indicates that the supply and demand in the elderly tourism industry in China are currently mismatched. It mentions that in 2019, the total expenditure of elderly tourists aged 65 and above in the country was RMB 319.78 billion, accounting for 5.6% of the total domestic tourism revenue of RMB 5.73 trillion. However, from the perspective of consumption structure, there is still significant potential for growth in the elderly tourism industry. Elderly tourists aged 65 and above in urban areas spent an average of RMB 1,209.20 per trip, which is only 74.3% of the average spending of RMB 1,626.50 of urban tourists. Meanwhile, elderly tourists in rural areas spent only RMB 847.50 per trip. The relatively low spending in elderly tourism can be attributed to the fact that the current tourism industry still primarily targets the middle-aged and young populations, with few products that cater to the needs of the elderly. There is insufficient integration of elderly tourism with industries in elements like culture, sports, and healthcare services. The silver communities often feel that the available travel products are not suitable for them, and the products they need are unavailable. However, behind this vast market is a pension service sector that is still in need of further development. 3. Rehabilitation Assistive Devices: According to data released by the World Health Organization, more than one billion people worldwide require some form of rehabilitation assistive devices, with the majority of these individuals being elderly or disabled. In China, the number of people in need of rehabilitation medical services has already exceeded 100 million. As the aging population issue intensifies and the likelihood of elderly people suffering from various health conditions gradually increases, this number is expected to continue rising. Data from Zhiyanzhan Industry Research Institute reveals that in 2019, the sales revenue from rehabilitation assistive device rental services in the Chinese market was RMB 20 million, and it is predicted that by 2030, this figure will rise to RMB 1.432 billion. As the aging population continues to increase in China, the imbalance between supply and demand in the rehabilitation assistive devices market is becoming particularly pronounced. According to relevant data, the proportion of people who have access to assistive device services has not yet surpassed 10% of the total population's demand. One reason for this is that China's elderly care industry started relatively late, and the types of rehabilitation devices are still rather limited. Compared to developed countries, the supply of high-quality rehabilitation assistive devices is clearly lagging behind. Among these factors, the insufficient variety of products is undoubtedly a key factor contributing to the scarcity of high-quality supply resources. Additionally, the technology of China's rehabilitation assistive products is generally low, and product quality varies significantly. In the current market environment, the production of low-cost products far exceeds demand, while the demand for high-quality products remains unmet and is mainly reliant on imports. Part of the reason for this is China's previous neglect of this industry, as well as a severe lack of investment in research and development. Additionally, the production model is relatively outdated. The government has also begun to pay attention to this issue. In 2024, China's State Council issued a policy document on promoting a 'silver economy to improve the well-being of the elderly.' It called for the improvement of the rehabilitation assistive devices industry, upgrading functional compensation devices such as hearing aids, orthotics, canes, and prosthetics, and enhancing life care products such as smart wheelchairs, transfer machines, and rehabilitation nursing beds. Crucially, in areas such as specialized medical foods, elderly care tourism, and rehabilitation assistive devices in China, the supporting policies and industrial infrastructure are underdeveloped. As elderly care services increasingly become a vital component of the health and silver sector, these industries present significant opportunities for further development and investment. Final analysis conclusion: As the aging population in China continues to grow, health-oriented elderly care has become a prevailing trend within the broader health industry. Within this context, the importance of elderly care services is becoming increasingly prominent. However, China remains significantly behind in several sectors, including specialized medical foods, elderly care tourism, and rehabilitation assistive devices. These industries present considerable potential for further development.

Distress In Commercial Real Estate Bonds Hit All-Time High – Anal...	By Artis Shepherd Commercial real estate continues to suffer despite the Federal Reserve’s attempt at ameliorating the capital markets with a 50-basis point rate cut in September. The pain is especially apparent in the so-called 'CRE-CLO' bond market. CRE-CLO bonds are packaged commercial real estate mortgages comprising short-term floating rate loans. These bridge loans were recently, and most notably, used to facilitate the biggest apartment investment bubble in history, but were also used in financing other commercial real estate sectors including office, retail, hotel, industrial, and self-storage. Most of the current batch of bridge loans originated in the 2020-2022 period—when benchmark rates were near zero and commercial real estate prices were peaking—and carried maturities of three to five years. Benchmark rates are now much higher, prices much lower, and property performance far worse than anticipated. Thus, a wall of maturities is staring borrowers, lenders, and bondholders in the face, all while underlying property performance disappoints. Despite attempts by lenders to extend and pretend—kicking the can down the road in the short term to avoid defaults until the Federal Reserve lowers rates enough to bail them out—their delusions of reprieve may be fading fast. Apartment Investors Play Checkers Instead of Chess At the end of Q3, the distress rate for CRE-CLO loans across all commercial real estate sectors reached 13.1 percent, an all-time high. Distress in this instance is defined as any loan reported 30 days or more delinquent, past the maturity date, in special servicing (typically due to a drop in occupancy or a failure to meet certain performance criteria), or any combination thereof. Figure 1 While roughly one in seven loans meets these criteria, the weakness is concentrated in two or three sectors. Unsurprisingly, office properties have the highest rate of distress, with nearly one in five CRE-CLO office loans experiencing current distress. This is to be expected after the covid panic of 2020, subsequent to which various 'work-from-home' directives essentially made the office market obsolete. For similar reasons, distress is also high in the retail segment, as all but the most well-heeled retailers were forced under by the maniacal and criminal government edicts of the time. However, the real story here is in the apartment, or multifamily, sector. Seen in Figure 1, the distress rate for apartments touched 16.4 percent in August. An astonishing number, indicating that one in six apartment bridge loans were distressed. The improvement to 13.7 percent shown for September is seasonal, as renters settle in at the start of the school year. While this picture is bad enough, the reality under the surface is far worse. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, using Q2 data from MSCI, the batch of currently distressed apartment bridge loans comprise roughly $14 billion in total loans, but there exists an additional $81 billion in potentially distressed loans. MSCI categorizes loans as 'potentially distressed' if they have seen delinquent payments, forbearance (when the lender lets interest payments accrue rather than taking a default action), or where key performance metrics like occupancy and net operating income are dangerously low. Figure 2 The arithmetically-aware will note that if the $14 billion of currently distressed apartment bridge loans comprise a roughly 14 percent distress rate at the end of Q2 (as shown in Figure 1) and there are an additional $81 billion in potentially distressed loans not yet categorized as 'currently distressed' (as shown in Figure 2), then MSCI data implies that 95 percent of all apartment bridge loans are either currently distressed or in imminent danger of distress. While astounding, this level of distress will come as no surprise to veterans of the apartment market. In the 2020-22 period, bridge loans of this variety were ubiquitous above a certain minimum loan size. And, because of the extreme and reckless nature of money printing undertaken by the Federal Reserve during this time—when interest rates were effectively zero—lenders underwrote property acquisitions with a 1.0x debt service coverage ratio ('DSCR'), meaning the initial net operating income of the property was projected to just cover interest payments, with nothing left over. Bridge loan interest rates floated at a spread (typically around 350 basis points, or 3.5 percent) to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), which was essentially 0 percent until mid-2022. Because of the 1.0x DSCR standard, a property acquired during this period that had net operating income of $1 million would have also had interest payments of $1 million at the then-prevailing interest rate of 3.5 percent. SOFR is now 4.9 percent, indicating a total interest rate of 8.4 percent (SOFR + 3.5 percent spread). This same property now has interest payments of $2.4 million while net operating income is unlikely to have increased to any significant extent, if at all. Insurance and property tax increases in particular have damaged apartment profitability while rent increases have been difficult to execute in the face of stagnating real wages. By the same token, absurdly optimistic renovation plans have been impossible in the face of cash flows increasingly shunted towards paying interest. The Amazing Disappearing Rate Cut The high amount of potential distress in CRE-CLO bonds, and the loans that underlie them, indicate an expectation on the part of lenders that help is coming in the form of lower interest rates. After all, capital markets have become used to being bailed out by the Federal Reserve, all but demanding that the taxpayer—not they—be held responsible for their poor decisions. Nevertheless, the Fed’s recent rate cut is proving not to be the magic bullet on which lenders relied. By August of this year, futures markets had fully priced in a 25-50 basis point Fed rate cut in September, and were expecting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December. This expectation for the Fed Funds Rate carried over into Treasury yields, a key benchmark for the commercial real estate industry. Particularly important in the case of distressed bridge loans since any hopes of refinancing are placed not on more bridge loans—which are now much less pervasive—but on the fixed-rate agency market comprising Fannie- and Freddie-backed apartment loans, which prices loans off a spread to treasuries. At the beginning of August, as markets priced in 75-100 bps of Fed rate cuts by year-end, 10-year Treasury yields reacted accordingly, dropping from 4.30 percent in late July (they had been 4.70 percent in April) to 3.65 percent in the middle of September. As of early November, most of that move had been erased—with yields back near 4.30 percent—roughly where they were prior to market pricing in this year’s Fed rate cuts. Fear and Trembling Undeniably, participants in the commercial real estate market—apartment bridge lenders in particular—are relying on loose monetary policy for their immediate salvation. They may get their wish. While Treasury rates have moved stubbornly higher, market forces only mean so much if the Fed decides to supplement rate cuts with purchases of treasuries, driving yields lower—another round of quantitative easing. Nevertheless, to the extent they’re allowed to be heard, market signals are unmistakable. A regime that can’t stop spending and continues to appropriate the property of its citizens through inflation will provide upward pressure on Treasury yields, all else equal. In a free market context, the rent-seekers that comprise the commercial real estate market will have to work out their own salvation.

The Counter-Insurgency Is ‘On’ – Against Trump’s ‘Storm’ – OpEd	The Deep State whispered to Trump: ‘You cannot withstand the storm’. Trump whispered back: 'I am the storm'. The war is on. The Deep State has launched a war of disruption to disable Trump’s ‘storm’. This week’s ATACM strike was but one part to an inter-agency counter-insurgency – a political strike directed at Trump; so too are all the inter-agency false narratives attributed to the Trump camp; and so too, the escalating provocations directed at Iran. Be assured the Five Eyes are full participants in the counter-insurgency. Macron and Starmer openly conspired together in Paris ahead of the U.S. announcement to promote the ATACMS strike. The inter-agency grandees clearly are very fearful. They must worry that Trump may expose the ‘Russia Hoax’ (that Trump in 2016 was a Russian ‘asset’) and put them in jeopardy. But Trump understands what’s afoot: 'We need peace without delay … The foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict. The greatest threat to Western civilization today is not Russia. It’s probably more than anything else ourselves… There must be a complete commitment to dismantling the entire Globalist Neo-con establishment that is perpetually dragging us into endless wars, pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad while they turn us into a Third World country and a Third World dictatorship right here at home. The State Department, the Defense bureaucracy, the intelligence services and all of the rest need to be completely overhauled and reconstituted. To fire the Deep Staters and put America first – we have to put America First'. Whilst the long-range ATACM launch on ‘deep Russian pre-2014 territory’ is no game-changer – it will not change the course of the war (ATACMS regularly are – at 90% – downed by Russian Air Defences); the salience of this act however, is not strategic; rather, it lies with the crossing into the realm of direct NATO attacks on Russia. Colonel Doug MacGregor reports that two sources are telling him that 'Russian nuclear rocket forces are on full alert. They are at the highest level of readiness ever achieved. It suggests that Russia has taken this crossing of the line very seriously'. Yes, it was a provocation, and President Putin will respond appropriately. He has to – but not necessarily through nuclear escalation. Why? Because the war in Ukraine is moving rapidly in his direction, with Russian forces closing-in on the Dnieper east bank. Effectively, facts on the ground will be the outcome determinant, leaving little point to external mediation. But more than just a dangerous provocation aimed at Russia, the ATACM and Storm Shadow attacks represent an attempt to turn foreign policy – literally – on its head. Instead of policy being aimed directly at a rising foreign adversary threatening U.S. hegemony, it is being transformed into a loaded weapon locked onto America’s domestic war. It is aimed specifically at Trump – to ‘hog tie’ him in, and to divert his attention to wars that he does not want. Logic suggests that Trump would want to keep clear of Netanyahu’s scheming for a war against Iran. But the ‘Israel Firsters’ and the Lobby (as Professor Jeffrey Sachs argues) long have had effective control over Congress and the U.S. military – more than does the President. Explains Sachs: 'Because the Zionist Lobby is so powerful, Netanyahu basically has had control over the Pentagon to fight wars on behalf of Israeli extremism. The war in Iraq in 2003 was a Netanyahu War. The attempt to overthrow Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the overthrow of Moamar Gaddafi – All were ‘Netanyahu Wars’'. The important point is that Netanyahu can ‘do what he does’ because it was always planned this way – a plan that has been 50 years in execution. The ‘Israel First’ strategy was fully embraced by Scoop Jackson (a two-times Presidential candidate). And just so the policy could not be rolled back, Scoop insisted on Zionists staffing the State Department, and that neo-cons and Zionists hold the reins at the NSC. That same pattern continues until today. At bottom lies the ultimate boondoggle by which the political class of both U.S. parties become wealthy and afford the campaign costs of remaining legislators: 'It’s quite a dandy deal that the Israel Lobby or the Zionist Lobby puts in, say, a hundred million dollars into campaigns and it gets trillions out –trillions, not billions, trillions out [in government] expenditures. And so, when Netanyahu speaks, it’s bizarre to me, but it is not Trump who is appointing or naming [those ‘Israel Firsters’ who are part of his Team, but Netanyahu]', Sachs says. When Netanyahu describes Trump’s ‘Israel First’ nominations as his ‘dream U.S. team’, the explanation is not difficult to see. On the one hand, Trump has a ‘Revolution’ to conduct in America and wants his nominations to office approved. And, on the other, Netanyahu has a further war he wants the U.S. to fight for him. 'The ‘Big Ugly’ was always a description of the battle that few understood',another commentator notes: 'The Senate is factually the core of republican opposition to MAGA and President Trump. The visible battle … consumes the most attention. However, it is the less-visible battle against the entrenched ideological Republicans that proves to be the hardest'. 'The Republicans in the upper chamber will not relinquish power easily. They have a multitude of weapons to use against the (Trump) insurgency … We are seeing this play out now in the alignment of Republican Senators who stand in opposition to Trump’s nomination of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, [as] this recent report[explains]'. 'The basic outline is that the senate leadership will reluctantly support Matt Gaetz for Main Justice, where ‘support’ means they will not directly oppose; in exchange for the nomination of FBI Director Mike Rogers [a co-founder of the ‘Never Trump’ group] to defend inter-agency interests at FBI'. The prospective Republican Senate Leader, John Thune, will play his cards carefully in order to extract maximum damage. He has leverage by trying to connect Trump to Netanyahu’s carnage in the region. Thune, whilst announcing huge quantities of weapons for Israel, said: 'To Our Allies in Israel, and to the Jewish People Around the world, my message to you is this: Reinforcements are on the way. In six weeks, Republicans will reclaim the Senate Majority, and we will make clear that the United States Congress stands squarely In Israel’s Corner'. Trump will need to play his cards carefully, too. Since, for his purposes, the absolute priority are his two domestic wars: First, 'dismantling the entire Globalist Neocon Establishment', and secondly, ending the out-of-control government expenditure that has bloated the Deep State boondoggle and turned the U.S. real economy into a shadow of its former self. Trump needs those radical reform nominations to pass, even if he has to sacrifice one or two to secure Senate approval for the others. The Israel First nominees, needless to add, will be approved seamlessly. Of the two ‘entanglement’ threats to Trump’s reform agenda, Russian escalation is the lesser of the two. The Ukraine war is motoring steadily towards some form of dénoument. One that works for Russia. Putin is in the driving seat, and does not need a major war with NATO. Nor does Putin need Trump’s ‘art of the deal’. A resolution of some sort will occur without him. However, Trump’s role will be important subsequently to define a new border between the security interests of the Atlanticists and those of the Asian heartland (including China and Iran). The other putative war – Iran – is the more dangerous to Trump. Jewish political influence and the Lobby has taken the U.S. into multiple disastrous wars before. And now, Netanyahu desperately needs a war and he is not alone. Much of Israel is clamouring for war that would end ‘all the fronts’ facing it. There is a profound conviction in this prospect as the solution and the ‘Great Victory’ that Netanyahu and Israel so desperately need. The ground has been dug-over, both by propaganda that Iran’s nuclear programme is ‘staggeringly vulnerable’ (which it isn’t), and by the media’s onslaught that replays the meme that to attack Iran now represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, with Hizbullah and Hamas already weakened. War with Iran – totally erroneously – is thus being sold as an ‘easy war’. There is an unshakeable certitude that it must be so. ‘We are strong, and Iran is weak’. Who will roll-back the Israel Firsters? They have the momentum and the fervour. A war against Iran will fare badly for Israel and the U.S. The wide ramifications likely will precipitate precisely the severe financial and market crisis that could derail Trump’s ‘Storm’.

Fencing The Ocean: Australia’s Social Media Safety Bill – OpEd	The Australian government is being run ragged in various quarters. When ragged, such a beast is bound to seek a distraction. And what better than finding a vulnerable group, preferably children, to feel outraged and noble about? The Albanese government, armed such problematic instruments as South Australia’s Children (Social Media Safety) Bill 2024, which will fine social media companies refusing to exclude children under the age of 14 from using their platforms, and a report by former High Court Chief Justice Robert French on the feasibility of such a move, is confident of restricting the use of social media by children across the country by imposing an age limit. On November 21, the government boastfully declared in a media release that it had officially 'introduced world-leading legislation to enforce a minimum age of 16 years for social media.' The proposed legislation, known as the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024, is supposedly going to 'deliver greater protections for young Australians during critical stages of their development.' The proposed legislation made something of an international splash. NBC News, for instance, called the bill 'one of the toughest in the world', failing to note its absence of muscle. To that end, it remains thin on detail. These laws constitute yet another effort to concentrate power and responsibilities best held by the citizenry in the hands of a bureaucratic-political class governed by paranoia and procedure. They are also intended to place the onus on social media platforms to place restrictions upon those under 16 years of age from having accounts. The government openly admits as much, seemingly treating parents as irresponsible and weak (their consent in this is irrelevant), and children as permanently threatened by spoliation. 'The law places the onus on social media platforms – not parents or young people – to take reasonable steps to ensure these protections are in place.' If the platforms do not comply, they risk fines of up to A$49.5 million. As for the contentious matter of privacy, the prime minister and his communications minister are adamant. 'It will contain robust privacy provisions, including requiring the platforms to ringfence and destroy any information collected to safeguard the personal information of all Australians.' The drafters of the bill have also taken liberties on what is deemed appropriate to access. As the media release mentions, Australia’s youth will still 'have continued access to messaging and online gaming, as well as access to services which are health and education related, like Headspace, Kids Helpline, and Google Classroom, and YouTube.' This daft regime is based on the premise it will survive circumvention. Children, through guile and instinctive perseverance, will always find a way to access forbidden fruit. Indeed, as the Digital Industry Group Inc says, this '20th Century response to 21st Century challenges' may well steer children into 'dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet'. In May, documents uncovered under Freedom of Information by Guardian Australia identified that government wonks in the communications department were wondering if such a scheme was even viable. A document casting a sceptical eye over the use of age assurance technology was unequivocal: 'No countries have implemented an age verification mandate without issue.' Legal challenges have been launched in France and Germany against such measures. Circumvention has become a feature in various US states doing the same, using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). While this proposed legislation will prove ineffectual in achieving its intended purpose – here, protecting the prelapsarian state of childhood from ruin at the hands of wicked digital platforms – it will also leave the apparatus of hefty regulation. One can hardly take remarks coming from the absurdly named office of the eSafety Commissioner, currently occupied by the authoritarian-minded Julie Inman Grant, seriously in stating that 'regulators like eSafety have to be nimble.' Restrictions, prohibitions, bans and censorship regimes are, in their implementation, never nimble. For all that, even Inman Grant has reservations about some of the government’s assumptions, notably on the alleged link between social media and mental harm. The evidence for such a claim, she told BBC Radio 5 Live, 'is not settled at all'. Indeed, certain vulnerable groups – she mentions LGBTQ+ and First Nations cohorts in particular – 'feel more themselves online than they do in the real world'. Why not, she suggests, teach children to use online platforms more safely? Children, she analogises, should be taught how to swim, rather than being banned from swimming itself. Instruct the young to swim; don’t ringfence the sea. Rather appositely, Lucas Lane, at 15 something of an entrepreneur selling boys nail polish via the online business Glossy Boys, told the BBC that the proposed ban 'destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen.' Already holed without even getting out of port, this bill will serve another, insidious purpose. While easily dismissed as having a stunted moral conscience, Elon Musk, who owns X Corp, is hard to fault in having certain suspicions about these draft rules. 'Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the internet by all Australians,' he wrote to a post from Albanese. One, unfortunately, among several.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuUH2Ry01l1K7	2024-11-22T16:50:13-08:00	
Surviving The New Trump Era – OpEd	Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election was surprising in a number of ways. He won every swing state as well as the popular vote, which a Republican candidate hadn’t done in two decades. He led his party to a congressional sweep, with the Republicans maintaining control of the House of Representatives and seizing a majority in the Senate. And he benefited from an unexpectedly large shift in votes among Latino and African-American men. In 2016, when Hilary Clinton won the popular vote by a significant margin but lost the Electoral College, anti-Trump forces could plausibly argue that most of the country opposed the new president. This time around, a very slim plurality of voters had no problem putting back into the White House a convicted felon who supported efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. In 2016, Trump himself was surprised by his own victory, and his team was ill-prepared to take power. In 2024, the Trump team is ready to hit the ground running on day one. It has already made some of the most extreme choices in U.S. history for the top positions in U.S. government: serial rule-breaker Matt Gaetz for attorney general, conspiracy theorist Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, right-wing TV host Pete Hegseth to head up the Pentagon, and extremist Stephen Miller to oversee immigration. This time around, the conservative establishment has a detailed game plan for the administration—Project 2025—that will guide Trump and his team. A new conservative thinktank in Washington, DC, the America First Policy Institute, will also be shaping the administration’s agenda. The Biden administration is scrambling to preserve some of the achievements that the Trump team plans to destroy, particularly around clean energy. Federal employees are fearful that they will lose their jobs in Trump’s promised attacks on the 'deep state.' Prominent anti-Trumpers are worried about the retribution that the former and future president has vowed to pursue. A demoralized Democratic Party is busy trying to figure out why it lost so badly in the elections. The next four years promise to be chaotic, vengeful, and dangerous. U.S. democracy is certainly in peril. The international rule of law will likely sustain numerous challenges, as it has already from Russia and Israel. And the planet itself, thanks to the climate denier returning to the White House, faces the prospect of a big step backward. What can be done to prevent the new Trump administration from doing its worst? At the global level, many countries will step into the vacuum created by U.S. withdrawal—from the Paris agreement, the effort to supply Ukraine, and various global human rights institutions. European powers will likely step up their assistance to Ukraine if the Trump administration ends all military support for the besieged country. Europe, too, will continue to take the lead in terms of a clean energy transition, but China, Brazil, and India are also producing a growing amount of electricity from renewable sources. Europe, however, is divided, with a number of far-right leaders who are thrilled to have a U.S. leader like Trump pushing for change from the outside. And the authoritarian leaders of other countries—Russia, China, Turkey—will happily take the U.S. side in eroding human rights norms and institutions. Inside the United States, the greatest resistance will come from the states. These states controlled by Democrats—California, Washington, Massachusetts—are already preparing to work together to block Trump from executing his extremist agenda. This resistance will likely take the form of filing suits that tangle up the new administration in court. During Trump’s first term, states joining together to stymie Trump succeeded in 94 cases. Unfortunately, thanks to all of Trump’s judicial appointees in his first term, these legal challenges will face longer odds. States also have considerable authority to set policy. For instance, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, a number of states preserved access to abortion services through court rulings, legislative policy, or popular referenda. In the case of Trump’s determination to proceed with mass deportations, some Democratic governors have already said that they will not allow state police to assist federal authorities with the removals. Democrat-led states will do their best to create islands of sanctuary against the overreach of federal authorities. NGOs and social movements will also mount resistance. A women’s march in Washington, DC just after Trump’s inauguration in 2017 demonstrated the depth and breadth of anger at the new president’s attitudes and proposed policies toward women. A comparable march is planned for January 2025. In addition to using the courts to stop or delay Trump policies, the resistance is organizing to push the Democratic Party toward economic populism. Harris lost a lot of working-class voters. As Maurice Mitchell of the Working Families Party puts it, 'Donald Trump has no solutions to address the needs of working-class people in this country. And we know that when he tries to implement his agenda of more tax cuts for billionaires, gutting health care, deporting millions, and supporting war crimes with public dollars, people will rise up.' The goal of these progressives is to highlight the economic costs of Trump’s early moves—mass deportations, tariffs, corporate tax cuts—to build momentum to win the 2016 midterm elections. Resistance will be much easier if the Democrats control at least one chamber of Congress. A number of key movements exploded during Trump’s first term: the Sunrise Movement around climate change began just a couple months after Trump’s inauguration, #MeToo went viral in October 2017, #BlackLivesMatter went global after police killed George Floyd in May 2020. Inevitably, after the despondency of the election fades and the outrage at Trump’s actual policies explodes, new movements will emerge to mobilize public anger. The centrists in the Democratic Party failed in the last election because they refused to embrace the kind of economic populism that the Republicans, traditionally the party of the rich, began to cultivate under Trump. The challenge for the Democrats will be negotiate between the two progressive parts of the party—the cultural left and the economic left. Although these parts often overlap, the party failed to emphasize the latter in the last election, which could have appealed to so many voters who ended up pulling the lever for Trump because of the rising cost of food and rent. In the seven stages of grief, progressives are wallowing right now in the first three stages of shock, denial, and anger. It would be a mistake to get stuck in the seventh and final stage of acceptance. When Trump’s policies begin to bite, the anger will return and, with it, a new determined resistance.

A US Federal Shield Law Is Needed To Protect The Press – OpEd	Like it or not, the Constitution’s First Amendment gives the media special protection in the American republic. That amendment says, 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press.' With one of the recent presidential candidates unconstitutionally threatening to shut down media outlets or take away their (non-existent) licenses when they say or do something he doesn’t like, it is not hard to imagine him in office trying to ferret out government whistleblowers by applying legal coercion to force members of the press to cough up their sources. In fact, this candidate, when he was president previously, did precisely that, as did his predecessor from the opposite party to an even greater extent. Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have laws or state court rulings that shield reporters from such government coercion. Despite the special protection of the media by the Constitution at the national level, no similar federal law exists to provide the same safeguard. Thus, federal Circuit Courts of Appeals rulings have had to give some stopgap protection. Why is a federal shield law for reporters needed? If the government cannot keep its essential information under wraps, then the press should be free to publish it for public inspection. However, the government doesn’t see it that way, and it has plenty of coercive legal power to subpoena reporters of leaked information to divulge their sources so that any government leaker can be prosecuted. And legally, if reporters gather or transmit vaguely defined 'national defense information' from leakers or whistleblowers, the journalists can risk being prosecuted criminally through the Espionage Act of 1917; only tradition has circumscribed the prosecution of reporters under the law. Of course, the general lack of protection for reporters’ sources dissuades such federal whistleblowers from talking to reporters about wrongdoing or corruption in government. Even in a republic, the public should be aware that plenty of corruption and skullduggery exist in government. A proposed federal reporters’ shield law, the PRESS (Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying) Act, is going through Congress and passed by the House of Representatives unanimously twice (an unusual feat of consensus in today’s polarized political world). However, the bill has been opposed in the Senate by a small group of members because it would encourage leaks of national security and law enforcement information. Yet, the bill has exceptions to force reporters to divulge sources to prevent any acts of terrorism or imminent violence and does not provide immunity to reporters who commit illegal acts to obtain information (such as hacking, etc.). Also, it is widely acknowledged that much overclassification exists in information classified by the feds for 'national security' reasons and that classification can be flagrantly abused to hide information that is embarrassing to the government. Finally, the few senators objecting to the bill claim to be constitutional textualists and originalists. Yet, the First Amendment’s prohibition on abridging the freedom of the press mentions no exception for 'national security.' Besides, the government has so much coercive power that it can often find leakers and prosecute them without intimidating reporters to divulge their sources. With any federal shield law, it may seem that reporters have been designated as a special class of citizens, but the First Amendment already realizes that keeping a vibrant republic demands special protections to maintain a free press. (In the internet era, however, any conception of journalists may need to be widened to include new forms of the profession.) And those safeguards for the press may be especially needed if a candidate is elected who parrots Joseph Stalin by deeming the press 'an enemy of the people' and regularly threatens media outlets with retribution and coercion.

Democrats Lost By Overly Orchestrating Anti-Trump Efforts – OpEd	Nancy Pelosi got blamed for top-down 'orchestration,' but the Cabal was broader than that The primary reasons voters elected Donald Trump over Kamala Harris and chose a Republican Congress were Joe Biden and the Democrats' miserable handling of the economy, immigration and foreign policy – and their embrace of far-left 'woke' polices, like sex-change operations for prisoners and other 'transgender rights.' However, the Democrat 'strategy' of hitting Trump with multiple indictments, tagging him and his supporters as 'existential threats to democracy,' and scaring women over abortion rights after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision may also have backfired, because these efforts were really designed to deflect attention from the harmful impacts of Biden's bad policies and actions. Topping it off, when he was pushed off the ticket for Vice President Kamala Harris in July, many voters may have smelled a rat. In essence, all of this was masterminded by a few political chieftains, notably former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), House Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and probably the Obamas, Clintons and their 'strategists.' Indeed, on MSNBC November 9, former Harris spokesperson and one-time Bernie Sanders operative Symone Sanders-Townsend (no relation to the senator), mouthed off against Pelosi, saying she 'orchestrated the very public demise of the president. And thank God for Joe Biden, that he came out and, yes, endorsed his VP. Pelosi is known for being 'calculated,' she went on to say, but 'where is her calculator now?' The key words here are 'orchestration' and 'calculating.' One could say 'None dare call it conspiracy,' or resurrect then-First Lady Hillary Clinton's 1998 phrase 'vast right-wing conspiracy' that 'has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.' Ms. Clinton was denounced for calling it a 'conspiracy.' In reality, a group of conservative activists and publications did continue an 'opposition research' campaign against President Bill Clinton from the day he was elected in 1992, to persuade Congress and courts to investigate him, impeach him and undermine his presidency. It didn't really work. Like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton was impeached, but he resurrected himself, while Hillary went on to become a US Senator from New York and Secretary of State – and came close to defeating Trump for president in 2016. The vast-left wing orchestration against Trump, however, was much more intricate, extensive and orchestrated than what conservatives used to tarnish Clinton. For example: * Advancing the phony 'Russiagate' scandal, at the highest levels of government * Supporting and glorifying the 'mostly peaceful' 'Resistance' against the Trump presidency * Instigating the 2019 House impeachment * Demanding school and business lockdowns during the Covid pandemic, to hurt the economy and President Trump * Supporting and capitalizing on the George Floyd riots * Perpetuating 'January 6' investigations, hearings, indictments and media coverage * Promoting fear and hysteria following the Dobbs decision and various state limitations on abortion * Pushing challengers out of the 2020 primaries to anoint Joe Biden (South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's 'masterstroke') * Preventing a competitive 2024 primary against Biden * Holding a Biden-Trump debate after primaries had ended, to see how President Biden would perform – and then forcing him off the ticket because he bombed * Coronating Kamala Harris after Biden was ousted Many are convinced that all these schemes were orchestrated by the Cabal of Pelosi, Schumer, the Obamas, the Clintons, and their strategists. Perhaps they wanted Biden to be the 2020 nominee, instead of independent-minded people like Senators Amy Klobuchar or Elizabeth Warren, or outsiders like Pete Buttigieg or Michael Bloomberg, because they knew they could manipulate Biden more easily. However, Joe Biden was never a leader in the US Senate; he was a follower. He does little thinking for himself, but makes decisions based on the advice of bureaucrats, political aides and special interests. He largely approved all the big-spending legislation and regulatory initiatives the Democrats and his Obama-holdover aides wanted when they regained control of Congress after 2020. And he opened the nation's borders to salve the bleeding hearts of his policy wonks. 'Joe Biden is nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical socialists,' former Vice President Mike Pence warned in 2020. In the end, that radicalism doomed the Democrats in 2024. In anointing Biden 'The Nominee' during the 2020 primaries, octogenarians Clyburn and Pelosi looked over Biden's eroding cognitive abilities. When he inevitably became a liability to the Democratic cause, they orchestrated his departure from the ticket for the younger Harris. They also engaged in incessant 'lawfare,' Trump indictments and January-6 investigations. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested the Democrats should have focused 'on one or two' charges against Trump, not four, and the indictments 'will backfire on the Left.' But The Cabal apparently wanted to extend the Trump-tarnishing so that there would be no trial before the GOP nominating process, thereby giving Republicans little opportunity to nominate someone else. Prolonging the 1/6 congressional investigation into the 2022 elections was an effort to tarnish not just Trump, but his supporters. Biden's unforgivable September 2022 speech in Philadelphia, when he attacked 'MAGA Republicans' for being disloyal to America, was part and parcel of this effort The media covered up the Cabal's intrigues. Anyone who watches CNN or MSNBC has seen how Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin, Pelosi, Clyburn and other leading Democrats are treated with kid gloves. The media hated Trump for calling them 'fake news' and colluded with the Democrats nearly every step of the way. It's unlikely that Symone Sanders-Townsend will come clean on all of this, though our nation would benefit greatly from the disinfecting sunshine she could provide. Regardless, it seems highly unlikely that the Democrats can change their stripes, because their base and big donors have gone Loony-Left. The Cabal probably thought throwing all those indictments and civil penalties at Trump would make him crack and cop a plea with the prosecutors. But Trump had the money and backbone to slug it out. He also had excellent lawyers, who mucked up the lawfare wheels. Essentially, he ran the clock out on the Democrats. There's a lesson here about being 'overzealous' in politics. Jerome Lawrence coauthored the 1955 play (and 1960 film) 'Inherit the Wind,' which examined extremism in 'the Scopes monkey trial,' as a metaphor for the McCarthy investigations. Lawrence wrote: 'Is it possible to be overzealous, to destroy that which you hope to save – so that nothing is left but emptiness?' With Trump wining a near landslide despite the criminal cases – and taking the Congress – it seems all the Democrat orchestrations left them nothing but emptiness.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuXBLrZUSNRzZ	2024-11-22T16:34:40-08:00	
Saudi Arabia: Public Investment Fund Linked To Abuses, Says HRW	Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), has facilitated and benefited from human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch said in a report. The 95-page report, 'The Man Who Bought the World: Rights Abuses Linked to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Its Chairman, Mohammad bin Salman,' found that Saudi Arabia’s vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is effectively controlled by one person, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Human Rights Watch found that the crown prince wields this enormous economic power in a largely arbitrary and highly personalized manner rather than for the Saudi people’s benefit and that the PIF is used to whitewash the Saudi government’s abuses. 'Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has unchecked control over the country’s nearly trillion dollar Public Investment Fund,' said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'The crown prince has used the Saudi sovereign wealth fund’s economic power to commit serious human rights violations and whitewash the reputational harm from these abuses.' Sovereign wealth funds are funds accumulated by a government, often consisting of government revenue, trade surpluses, and reserves, and are invested domestically and abroad. Many have been built on oil wealth. The report is based on a review of government statements, Saudi court documents; Saudi laws and government decrees; documents released during court proceedings in Canada and the United States; company records and reports; investigations and analyses by journalists financial experts, and academics; as well as interviews with Saudi activists and dissidents, journalists, experts, and lawyers with long experience in Saudi Arabia. The PIF has benefited directly from serious human rights abuses linked to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS. This includes the crown prince’s 2017 'anti-corruption' crackdown that consisted of arbitrary detentions, abusive treatment of detainees, and the extortion of property from Saudi Arabia’s elite. The PIF has facilitated serious human rights violations linked to MBS through companies it owns and controls, such as the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the anti-corruption crackdown. Sky Prime Aviation, one of the companies transferred to the PIF during the crackdown, owned the two planes used in 2018 by Saudi agents to travel to Istanbul, where they murdered Khashoggi. MBS overhauled the PIF’s governance framework and concentrated an immense degree of control and oversight of the fund into his own hands, enabling him to unilaterally direct enormous sums of state wealth to megaprojects that do little to realize economic, social, or cultural rights in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s most marginalized people—migrant workers, rural communities, and poor and working-class residents—have borne the brunt of abuses stemming from the fund’s projects. Capital from the PIF has been used for projects that have forcibly evicted residents, razed neighborhoods, subjected migrant workers to serious abuses, and silenced communities. Human Rights Watch also found violations linked to some of the PIF’s most high-profile megaprojects, including the NEOM region, an economic zone and new city on the Red Sea that is being erected from scratch, as well as the Jeddah Central Project, an urban development project in Jeddah. Saudi authorities forcibly evicted members of the Huwaitat tribe, who have for centuries inhabited the Tabuk province, in the planned NEOM area, arrested those who protested their evictions, and killed one protesting resident. Two residents received sentences of 50 years in prison, and three received death sentences for resisting the forced evictions. The wholly-PIF-owned Jeddah Central Development Company, which is carrying out the Jeddah Central Project, forcibly evicted large numbers of middle and lower-class Saudis, foreigners, and migrant workers from their homes in Jeddah’s previously vibrant working-class neighborhoods to transform the area into a luxury shopping and tourism district. Under internationally recognized human rights norms, the Saudi government should progressively realize economic, social, and cultural rights to the maximum of available resources, including those the PIF controls. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Saudi Arabia has the highest poverty headcount rate for nationals in the GCC at 13.6 percent, meaning that poverty affects nearly 'one in seven nationals in Saudi Arabia.' This figure does not include all Saudi residents, particularly migrant workers who make up approximately 42 percent of the population. The PIF under MBS operates with little transparency and accountability, raising concerns over whether these funds are ultimately invested and managed in a way that satisfies these international norms. The existence of a centrally controlled stream of revenue, such as oil revenue, can exacerbate an undemocratic ruler or governing elite’s abuses and misrule by providing the financial wherewithal to entrench and enrich itself without any corresponding accountability. These problems are clearly present in Saudi Arabia and raise significant risk that MBS is using the PIF to entrench his de facto rule by providing him with direct access and control to nearly a trillion dollars of Saudi Arabia’s wealth, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch did not find evidence that PIF-funded projects advanced the government’s obligations to fulfill economic, social, and cultural rights of its people. The Saudi government does not define or disclose basic data on poverty, or set a poverty line, making it likely that the poverty rate is much higher than the UN figure, especially affecting groups that are economically marginalized and vulnerable to systematic labor abuses. PIF investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in the world have been used as a tool of Saudi soft power and influence. These investments include sports such as the LIV golf tour, the FIFA 2034 World Cup, and Premier League football club Newcastle United, in the UK, are a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s influence operations abroad. These investments which seek to garner uncritical foreign support for MBS’s agenda, spread disinformation about the country’s rights record, neutralize scrutiny, silence critics, and undermine institutions seeking transparency and accountability, Human Rights Watch found. As a state entity, the PIF has an obligation to uphold Saudi Arabia’s international human rights commitments. Businesses have a responsibility to avoid causing or contributing to human rights harm. In line with these responsibilities, businesses should conduct thorough and independent human rights due diligence prior to any engagement with the PIF and should refrain from activities that would bolster the reputation of government entities or officials recently and credibly accused of serious abuses. When serious adverse human rights impacts stemming from engagement with the PIF are unavoidable, businesses should suspend their engagement with the PIF. 'Businesses with ties to the Saudi Public Investment Fund have a responsibility to end their engagement with it if serious human rights violations connected with the PIF are unavoidable,' Shea said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuTDFtH9RotFd	2024-11-22T16:31:12-08:00	
US House Of Representatives Approves Legislation Threatening Nonp...	On Thursday, the United States House of Representatives approved legislation that would threaten nonprofit organizations’ exercise of free speech rights. The legislation would accomplish this goal by empowering the US government to selectively clamp down on nonprofits to an extent that targeted organizations may cease to exist. This is all being done in the name of countering terrorism, a trusty standby excuse for the US government exercising authoritarian powers. The House approved the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act (HR 9495) by a vote of 219 to 184. The 'yes' votes came mainly from Republican members, and all the 'no' votes were from Democrats plus Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, an Advisory Board member for the Ron Paul Institute. J.D. Tuccille provided an informative critique of HR 9495 in a Friday Reason article. The bill, explained Tuccille, 'allows for the ‘termination of tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations.’' Continuing, Tuccille wrote: The designation of organizations as such is left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, based on that official’s judgment that a non-profit group has, in the last three years, provided ‘material support or resources’ to what the U.S. government considers a terrorist organization. The language provides for a 90-day window during which time supposed ‘terrorist supporting organizations’ can appeal the designation, but the burden is on them to prove that they’re not guilty. This turns due process on its head. The threat from this new bureaucratic power is extreme for targeted organizations. As Tuccille puts it in his article, the loss of 'tax -exempt status' is essentially a death penalty for most non-profit organizations.' What a censorship power this legislation hands over to the executive branch bureaucracy. Nonprofit organizations whose activities challenge the ambitions of the US government and connected individuals, businesses, and organizations, can be snuffed out. Meanwhile, other organizations will have a big incentive to limit their own speech to avoid being similarly targeted for destruction. During the House floor debate on HR 9495, Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) presented a brief, persuasive speech against the bill. Here is the text of his speech: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 9495. As Members of Congress, it is our duty to stand against terrorism and stand up for our common values, but this bill does neither.What does it do?What it does is grant sweeping draconian powers to the executive branch to essentially shut down any nonprofit.On what basis would future administrations, Democratic or Republican, be able to exercise such power?On a mere accusation.I repeat, an accusation.All nonprofits could be under scrutiny. These are decent people who are advocating on issues from religious freedom to animal welfare.Mr. Speaker, why would conservatives, the very same people who gnashed their teeth at executive overreach, support such a measure?Why would they suddenly about-face and sacrifice the values they claim to stand for?It is because this is a gift to the President-elect, Mr. Trump, wrapped up in a bow right before the holidays.On the campaign trail, he has made no secret of who he would seek to go after. This is bigger than the President-elect because now every President who would be king would be free to seek vengeance on their political opponents for every perceived slight.I caution my colleagues to consider how far-reaching the consequences of this bill would be. This bill would apply to all future Presidents.At a time when we should be strengthening our checks and balances and shoring up our guardrails, this legislation would do the opposite.Mr. Speaker, in the strongest possible terms, I urge my colleagues to vote against this executive branch power grab. This legislative threat to nonprofit organizations and their free speech can be expected to be rejected by the Democratic controlled Senate and President Joe Biden. But, it will likely be back for another go-round under more amenable conditions come January when the House, Senate, and presidency are all in Republican control.

Putin’s Order To Promote Patriotism Repeats Stalin’s ‘Almost Word...	Vladimir Putin’s May 2024 directive to use history lessons in the schools to boost patriotism and a willingness to sacrifice one’s life for Russia repeats Stalin’s May 1934 order to do the same thing in the Soviet Union 'almost word for word,' according to Boris Kerzhentsev. The historian and commentator traces the evolution of Kremlin policy toward history and its use as a propaganda tool in the first decades of Soviet power and then says that the changes Putin has introduced are virtually the same (moscowtimes.ru/2024/11/16/istoriya-v-zakone-kak-gosudarstvo-ispolzuet-proshloe-dlya-podgotovki-pushechnogo-myasa-a147872). 'Like Stalin, Putin’s ‘ideological front’ is rapidly turning into a real military front, on which people fooled by propaganda are dying senselessly. To be sure, foreign agents are not yet mentioned in the text of Putin’s ‘Foundations,’ but this is most likely a matter of time,' Kerzhentsev says. Indeed, he continues, 'some propagandists are already close to, as before, demanding from a high rostrum that ‘rootless cosmopolitans’ be shot ‘like mad dogs,’' as Stalin’s notorious prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky did. And thus one must conclude that despite everything, 'for almost a century, nothing has changed in Russia.' 'Using its unlimited resources of violence, control and coercion, the government constantly steals the country's truth about the past, composes its own alternative version of history, and declares it the only true one. And it does so not for the love of writing, but purely for the sake of ensuring the self-preservation of the regime,' Kerzhentsev concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuTwEB3BCQvc6	2024-11-22T16:26:43-08:00	
What Kennedy Must Do To Defeat Regulatory Capture – OpEd	President-Elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services is cause for celebration for anyone who cares about the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over regulatory agencies, and the deleterious effect it has had on the health of Americans. It is nearly impossible to express just how remarkable and potentially world-changing this is. Only a few years ago, it would have been beyond the imagination of any serious political commentator. Those of us who believe in the freedom of medical choice – and especially those who have been personally harmed by the industry – have every reason to be ecstatic. But even if Kennedy is confirmed, and even if he manages to implement his ideas, will they be enough to bring about real, lasting, change? One of Kennedy’s primary targets will be the regulatory capture that practically defines the pharmaceutical industry and the agencies tasked with overseeing it. He has spent decades tirelessly battling this particular beast, and has recently articulated a number of specific policy ideas aimed at rooting out the 'corruption' that characterizes the regulatory agencies as well as the world of medical research. But is that even possible? In order to answer this question, we need to examine the nature of the regulatory state itself. The Regulatory State There is nothing new about private commercial interests seeking to use government force to subvert the free market to their advantage – and to the disadvantage of everyone else. The medical and pharmaceutical industries are hardly unique in this regard. Generally, interest groups, or individual corporations, do this by convincing politicians to erect barriers – in the form of laws and regulations – to those who would compete with them. Much has been written about the extent to which the regulation of business sprang, not from a desire to protect consumers, but rather from the desire on the part of a few businesses to secure for themselves an environment in which they are insulated from competition. In their 1993 paper, 'The Protectionist Roots of Antitrust,' for example, Don Boudreaux and Tom DiLorenzo look at some specific examples of business interests lobbying government to enact antitrust legislation that would stifle their competition. They write: '(F)or over a century the antitrust laws have routinely been used to thwart competition by providing a vehicle for uncompetitive businesses to sue their competitors for cutting prices, innovating new products and processes, and expanding output. This paper has argued that, moreover, antitrust was a protectionist institution from the very beginning; there never was a ‘golden age of antitrust’ besieged by rampant cartelization, as the standard account of the origins of antitrust attests.' The world of health care as we know it today in America is the result of similar efforts by some practitioners and professional associations to defeat their competitors, not by outperforming them in the marketplace, but by enacting laws to limit their ability to practice. Most notorious among these efforts was the 1910 Flexner Report. Commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation, the Report recommended closing down the vast majority of medical schools; streamlining medical education to exclude non-allopathic modalities (and mostly eliminating medical schools for women and African Americans); giving state governments the power to approve medical schools; and dramatically tightening medical licensing restrictions. In fact, the Flexner Report was, for the most part, an unpublished 1906 reportwritten by the American Medical Association (AMA). At the time, the AMA made no secret about its motives in seeking the reforms to which Abraham Flexner lent his name. It sought to reduce the supply of physicians in order to further enrich its own members. In 1847, the Association’s committee on educational standards reported that: 'The very large number of physicians in the United States…has frequently been the subject of remark. To relieve the diseases of something more than twenty millions of people, we have an army of Doctors amounting by a recent computation to forty thousand, which allows one to about every five hundred inhabitants…No wonder, then, that the profession of medicine has measurably ceased to occupy the elevated position which once it did; no wonder that the merest pittance in the way of remuneration is scantily doled out even to the most industrious in our ranks…' The very history of the regulatory state informs us that it was not implemented for the purpose of protecting consumers from powerful corporate interests, but to protect the interests of certain powerful corporations and groups of professionals. It is important to remember this when we hear critics bemoan the 'corruption' in the regulatory agencies, and insist that this can be remedied if we just put the right people in charge of them. No. 'Corruption' is the primordial swamp from which these agencies emerged. It is in their DNA. It is, in fact, their very reason for being. There is no 'reforming' that which is operating precisely as it was designed to operate. Moreover, even if these agencies had been designed with the interests of the public in mind (and never mind that 'the public' is not a single entity with uniform interests to begin with), the reality remains that there is no mechanism by which they can be made accountable to us. Accountability between two parties can only come when each party has choice regarding whether or not they interact with the other. This is not the case with regulatory agencies. These are imposed upon us. We are forced to use their 'services' whether we are happy with them or not; whether they do a good job or not; whether they make our lives more dangerous than they otherwise would be or not. No matter how badly regulatory agencies perform, we are not free to take our business elsewhere. The FDA What this means is that – just as with all other political actors – the leaders of these agencies are removed from the consequences that their actions have on others. In the case of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this has led to decades of malfeasance and error that have cost many, many, lives. Perhaps the most infamous example in recent times is the FDA’s complete failure to protect the public from the painkiller Vioxx. The agency approved the drug in 1999, following which it is believed to have killed as many as 55,000 Americans before being withdrawn in 2004. Significantly, the FDA did not withdraw Vioxx from the market, Merck did that itself. In fact, it appears that the regulatory agency worked to suppress information about the known risks of the drug: 'A Merck memo uncovered in November showed that Merck scientists were aware in 1996 that the drug might contribute to heart problems. Then in 2000, a Merck study found that patients taking Vioxx were twice as likely to suffer heart attacks as patients taking older painkillers. Meanwhile, mid-level FDA officials who warned of these dangers were shunned by the agency. In FDA parlance, those with a 'point of view' on Vioxx were unwelcome in certain meetings concerning the drug.'' To believe that the Vioxx scandal was an isolated event would be a mistake. Indeed, the history of the agency is littered with similar stories. Worse, it also uses its power to prevent people from having access to treatments that may help them, but that would not be very profitable, or which might otherwise go against the interests of the agency’s industry benefactors. We witnessed this in the extreme during the past few years, when the FDA and the rest of the regulatory establishment waged a war on Covid-19 treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, and even Vitamins C and D. The FDA does not fail to protect the public because it happens to have bad people in its leadership, or because they are 'incompetent.' It fails to protect us because it has no incentive to do so. We are captive 'customers.' We cannot take our money elsewhere. The leadership at the FDA has no tangible reason to care about our interests. And there is no amount of 'draining the swamp' that can change this. What Can Be Done? The only hope, within this kind of system, is to defy the odds – and not insignificantly, to defy the vast sums of industry lobbying money – and get someone into a position of power over the regulatory agencies who has the will to force them to act contrary to their own incentives within the system. That person right now is undoubtedly Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and, should he be confirmed as Secretary of HHS, he will undoubtedly do some good things. But what happens after he is gone? The system itself will not have been changed. The incentives that are in place now will still be in place then. What happens when there is no longer a good person, with good intentions, in a position of some power over these agencies? Should our right to informed consent, for example, rely on our being fortunate enough to have 'good people' in charge of fundamentally unaccountable agencies? Agencies that have the power to withhold potentially life-saving products from the marketplace, while at the same time providing a false sense of security about the dangerous ones they allow? One of the proposals Kennedy has put forward is to reform the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. He writes: 'Pharmaceutical companies pay a fee every time they apply for a new drug approval, and this money makes up about 75% of the budget of the Food and Drug Administration’s drug division. That creates a barrier to entry to smaller firms and puts bureaucrats’ purse strings in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry.' Reforming, or better yet, eliminating, this fee would be a step in the right direction. But it would not change the fundamental nature of the FDA. It would not magically make that agency accountable to the public, nor would it remove the ability of those in the pharmaceutical industry to make other forms of payments to the agency. Even now, the industry has other ways of exerting its influence, including the infamous 'revolving door,' whereby agency officials who do well by a particular drug company while working for the FDA are later rewarded with lucrative positions in that company. And according to an investigative report by Science, post-approval payments in varying forms are also common. Science examined payment records between 2013-2016, and found that: 'Of the more than $24 million in personal payments or research support from industry to the 16 top-earning advisers—who received more than $300,000 each—93% came from the makers of drugs those advisers previously reviewed or from competitors.' Critics of this kind of industry capture have long called for 'getting money out' of the regulatory structure. But it remains unclear how this might be achieved. Certainly, specific payment channels, such as the Prescription Drug User Fees, can be eliminated or banned. But to imagine that those in the industry would not contrive of other ways to buy influence is not realistic. Just as critically though, even if pharmaceutical companies were somehow prevented from being able to pay off the agencies that regulate them, this would still not render those agencies accountable to the public, or to anyone other than themselves. The only way to 'get money out' of the regulatory state is to stop giving that state favors to sell. It is to eliminate the state’s power to restrict market entry and market participation. These are the political favors that powerful industry interests bid for. If we want to stop that from happening, we need to eliminate those favors. But We Need the Regulatory State to Keep Us Safe! Astonishingly, even after the past four years, there are still a great many people who believe that the regulatory state exists to keep us safe. That it withheld potentially life-saving therapeutics from us, not out of malice or the interests of its corporate cronies, but for our protection. That it worked hard to censor information about these therapeutics, and about the dangers of the experimental product it was promoting, for the same reason. That maybe some mistakes were made during this time, but that really, truly, these agencies are designed to protect us and if we just get the right people in charge, and maybe do a little tinkering with the machinery, they will work as they are supposed to. Again, no. They are working precisely as they are supposed to. But for those who remain unconvinced, for anyone who still believes that existing laws against fraud, malpractice, and other torts are not enough, that we need some sort of government oversight over the medical industry, let’s look a little closer. Economist Milton Friedman famously recommended abolishing both medical licensing and the FDA. He wrote: 'The FDA has done enormous harm to the health of the American public by greatly increasing the costs of pharmaceutical research, thereby reducing the supply of new and effective drugs, and by delaying the approval of such drugs as survive the tortuous FDA process.' Others who have examined the agency’s track record concur that the agency does more harm than good. Nobel laureate George Hitchings, for instance, estimated that the FDA’s five-year delay in introducing the antibiotic Septra to the market resulted in 80,000 deaths in the US. Drug regulation expert Dale Gieringer says that the death toll resulting from the FDA forcibly keeping new medications from the market far outweighs any benefits it may have produced. He writes: 'The benefits of FDA regulation relative to that in foreign countries could reasonably be put at some 5,000 casualties per decade or 10,000 per decade for worst-case scenarios. In comparison…the cost of FDA delay can be estimated at anywhere from 21,000 to 120,000 lives per decade.' Economist Daniel Klein notes that, prior to the FDA’s powers being expanded in 1962, existing tort law did a good job of protecting consumers: 'The FDA was much less powerful before 1962. The historical record—decades of a relatively free market up to 1962—shows that free-market institutions and the tort system succeeded in keeping unsafe drugs to a minimum. The Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy (107 killed) was the worst in those decades. (Thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States.) The economists Sam Peltzman and Dale Gieringer have made the grisly comparison: the victims of Sulfanilamide and other small tragedies prior to 1962 are insignificant compared to the death toll of the post-1962 FDA.' He goes on to compare medical regulation to safety regulation in other industries: 'How is safety assured in other industries? In electronics, manufacturers submit products to Underwriters’ Laboratories, a private organization that grants its safety mark to products that pass its inspection. The process is voluntary: manufacturers may sell without the UL mark. But retailers and distributors usually prefer the products with it. 'Suppose someone proposed a new government agency that forbade manufacturers from making any electronic product until approved by the agency. We would think the proposal to be totalitarian and crazy. But that is the system we have in drugs…' Conclusion As long as regulatory powers exist that allow state entities to restrict entry into markets, and to dictate how producers may participate in those markets, there will always be those who are incentivized to gain access to the levers of that power and use it to further their own ends. Those who have the means to pay for this power will always find ways to do so. What many call 'corruption' is rather the predictable and inevitable outcome of institutions that are, by their very nature, unaccountable to those they purport to serve. The solution is not to get 'better people' in charge of these institutions, nor is it to engage in a never-ending battle to stop participants from following the incentives the system has created for them. The solution is to remove those incentives. The solution is to remove the powers of the regulatory state itself. If Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is confirmed as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, he will undoubtedly strike some blows against regulatory capture. Whatever he does in this position can only be an improvement over what we have now, and it is possible that some of his reforms may even endure beyond his own tenure. But he has the chance to do much more. The regulatory state is a Gordian knot, and it is not enough to work at untangling its various components. It needs to be sliced through once and for all. The way to do this is simple: Abolish the FDA, abolish the NIH, abolish the CDC. End all medical licensing and accreditation. Get the government out of health care everywhere. Perhaps this sounds like a political impossibility. And perhaps it is. But until very recently, RFK, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services was a political impossibility. I submit that we do not know what is possible and what is not. Kennedy has an unprecedented opportunity to strike at the root of what makes our healthcare system so dysfunctional: to dismantle the institutions that stifle the production of medicine, distort information about its safety, and suppress alternatives. He has an opportunity to make a profound difference not only for the next four years but for generations to come. We should all hope that he does not waste it.

The Operational And Strategic Genius Of The Kursk Offensive – Ana...	By Dan Cox (FPRI) -- Current analysis of the recent offensive conducted by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of Russia is incomplete at best and misguided at worst. Most of the pundits are focused on speculating whether the recent offensive will anger American politicians, lead to an eventual victory, or halt the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Dealing with the anger of American politicians first, it is unlikely that Ukraine conducted this counteroffensive in a vacuum. American politicians were likely aware of the operation. Dealing with the next question, speculating on whether one operation will 'tip the scales' fits into the American culture of viewing events, wars, and almost everything as a black-and-white or win-lose dichotomy. Finally, the attack on Russia was not intended to halt the main Russian offensive in Pokrovsk. At most, this attack was aimed at drawing troops from the Russian attack on Kharkiv, which, being one of the largest population centers in Ukraine, would represent a major loss for Ukraine, should it fall into Russian hands. Instead of entering this American cultural quagmire, this essay examines the situation by looking at the Kursk campaign holistically and through the intersection of military operations and strategy. This intersection is often referred to as the area where operational art occurs. By examining the Kursk offensive holistically, this approach does not fall into the rut of determining winners and losers. Instead, myriad potential opportunities and pitfalls can be examined simultaneously. The evidence shows a great deal of cleverness and foresight in developing the Kursk battle plan. The West should support this new propensity in the system as it puts Vladimir Putin and his military planning staff on the horns of multiple dilemmas. A Brief Analysis of the Kursk Campaign So Far One of the best analyses of the Kursk campaign comes from Foreign Policy Magazine. However, the debate is emblematic of the narrowness and black-and-white construct of argumentation over the Ukrainian military campaign. This debate between two Foreign Policy Magazine columnists produces some curious insights into the Kursk offensive. Emma Ashford took the con side of the debate, arguing that it was unlikely that Ukrainian forces could hold what they had taken. She painted the operation as producing, at best, a short-term narrative shift in Zelensky’s favor. She concluded that the offensive is not likely to produce lasting positive results; although, she admits later in the debate that Putin has at least temporarily lost the claim of freezing the conflict and easily controlling what they have already taken in Ukraine. Matt Kroenig countered by noting that the offensive accomplished several key strategic aims, such as taking the war home to Russia (hundreds of thousands of Russians had to be evacuated), challenging Putin as a wartime leader, buoying Ukrainian morale, and shocking the West. The narrative of 'shocking the West' is common in analyzing the Kursk offensive and is dubious. It is doubtful that NATO military planners had no idea of this offensive. Whether or not Ukraine directly informed the US and other Western policymakers, the level of coordination between Ukrainian and Western military planners makes it likely that Ukraine’s partners were able to infer an impending operation. This assertion may prove untrue in the future, but that would only point to deeper strategic problems between the West and Ukraine. It is not the case that any of the assertions are necessarily wrong. The main complaint is that they are incomplete and largely reside in narrow strategic and political arguments and assertions. Other standard refrains in the analysis so far are that this operation was a gamble for Ukraine and the offensive was ineffective at stopping the Russians’ forward progression in eastern Ukraine. Few military operations are a true gamble despite current assertions to the contrary. Military planning revolves around assumptions and risk. The main risk in this mission is that the assumptions are wrong. I would posit that the most likely assumptions that preceded this operation have, so far, proven to be correct. Likely Assumptions and Risks in the Kursk Campaign The first set of assumptions had to be that Putin’s military had no strategic reserve and was so desperately trying to win in Ukraine that Russia had devoted little or no attention to defending the Russo–Ukrainian border from the Russian-controlled Donbas Region to the border of Belarus. The ease with which fifteen thousand soldiers were able to take land in Kursk supports such assumptions on the ground. A little over a few divisions’ worth of Ukrainian forces expanded past the initial incursion of a few hundred square kilometers to more than double that area in just a few weeks. The Ukrainian planners also likely assumed that they could make it far enough into Russian territory to threaten logistical lines and necessary electrical and gas hubs supplying troops in Ukraine. Since Ukrainian forces have been able to destroy several critical Russian bridges that resupply its troops and an oil depot, this assumption has borne fruit as well. The planners must have also assumed it was better to use fifteen thousand troops to advance into Russia and build defensive positions than to hold positions that would likely be overrun. Therefore, fifteen thousand Ukrainians could potentially hold out against a force five times that size or larger in Russia depending on whether the force sent to dislodge is ill-trained and ill-equipped conscripts. Putin ordered thirty thousand soldiers from eastern Ukraine to march to the Kursk region to defend it, and he has also apparently thrown some eight thousand against the Ukrainian incursion. This represents a significant expansion of war and a de facto admission of Russia’s limited ability to generate labor. Eventually, the Russian offensive in Donetsk might be put at risk because of the Kursk campaign, even though this was not the main point of invading Russia. Finally, the Ukrainian military and political leaders assessed that an invasion of Kursk would change the narrative in their favor. Further, this would place Putin at a strategic disadvantage and expose fundamental weaknesses in Russia continuing the war. The discussion below points to these assumptions also being true. Placing Putin on the Horns of Multiple Dilemmas The Kursk offensive exposed many deficiencies and vulnerabilities in the Russian offensive as the war approached the third-year mark. Unfortunately, some pundits and news outlets prefer to view the Kursk offensive as a gamble or even a failure. France 24 recently reported that Russia is making gains in eastern Ukraine despite the Kursk action. The news outlet also reported that Ukrainian planners had hoped to draw Russian troops away from this offensive, but it did not happen. This is factually incorrect and an overly narrow view of the Kursk offensive. It is factually incorrect to assert there was no effect on the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russia redeployed thirty thousand troops to stop the advancement of the Ukrainian forces into Russia. Whether this puts the Russian offensive at risk remains to be seen, but it does not matter as much as some think. The move illustrates to the world that Putin has no strategic reserve to put into the fight and is likely desperate. Further, arguing that delaying the Russian offensive was the only operational objective is short-sighted. The fact that Russia is pressing on with its offensive may counterintuitively be good for the Ukrainian war effort. Russia continues to take unsustainable losses, and the Kursk offensive has accelerated that trend. They have already taken an additional 6,600 casualties and lost 70 tanks because the Ukrainian military infiltrated Russia. Putin panicked and made yet another strategic mistake by telling his own people that the Ukrainian forces would be dislodged from Kursk by October 1 of this year. By early November, Putin had finally garnered a force to attack the Kursk oblast. However, the ground retaken is negligible and the losses the Russians are suffering are great. Putin is desperate. Every day beyond October 1 that the Ukrainian forces remain in Russia, Putin is losing political credibility. Further, this is the second summer in a row that Putin has faced a major credibility challenge. Last summer, the leader of the Wagner Group private military organization, Yevgeny Prigozhin, mounted an insurgency that briefly marched toward Moscow. This summer, Ukrainian forces successfully invaded Russia in the historic Kursk region. To add insult to injury, the Ukrainian success in Russia came mere months after Putin gave a speech commemorating the Russian sacrifices during World War II in Kursk. The Kursk offensive has also increased the Ukrainian military’s operational reach. The Ukrainian forces have already destroyed some key supply bridges supporting Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have also been able to destroy fuel depots, particularly oil, deeper into Russia, threatening both the Russian economy and the ability of Russia to continue to supply its mechanized units. Ukraine has also been able to hit an oil refinery and a power station deeper into Russia. The loss of the refinery could seriously damage oil exports, which are already lagging due to economic sanctions imposed by the West. Putin is also suffering from a foreign policy and narrative perspective. Several pundits have noted that Putin seems to be losing allied support as Ukraine demonstrates its ability to compete with Russia in Ukraine and, shockingly, take Russian territory. Putin cannot carpet-bomb Ukrainian positions now that they are on Russian soil. Further, even though Putin diverted thirty thousand troops in an attempt to repel the Kursk incursion, their move will likely be insufficient for the task. The recent addition of some ten to twelve thousand North Korean troops to the Russian counter-offensive may tilt the odds a bit in Russia’s favor, but also telegraphs Russia’s lack of a strategic reserve and was the catalyst for Western countries to allow Ukraine to use their weapons to strike inside Russia. Now, Putin is facing a dilemma that he may have to throw poorly trained conscripts at the situation. He promised he would not do this; many of these conscripts are ethnically Russian, so their deaths carry more negative political weight for Putin, who cannot afford a collapse in support for his war among ethnic Russians. All of these negative strategic dilemmas are now on Putin’s shoulders. Further, he now has to consider that a long border between the Donbas region, which Russia controls, and Belarus is now at risk. He can hardly respond to the Kursk incursion. Another incursion at a different point along the border would be devastating. Pundits reporting that the Kursk offensive has failed because Putin continues a costly advance at a snail’s pace in eastern Ukraine are short-sighted. Recent polls show that trust in Putin has fallen precipitously in the wake of the Kursk offensive. Putin might find himself in political trouble because the planners of the Ukrainian offensive successfully linked operations to strategic ends, placing Putin on the horns of multiple dilemmas.

Putin Warns Of More Combat Tests For New Missile After Ukraine St...	(RFE/RL) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, a nuclear-capable weapon, will continue to be tested, including in combat conditions, as Moscow struck several Ukrainian regions with other, less powerful weapons. 'We will continue these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and the nature of the security threats that are created for Russia,' Putin said on November 22 at a meeting with Defense Ministry officials and military-industrial complex officials. The Kremlin leader also called for serial production of the large missile to begin. Russia launched the so-called Oreshnik ballistic missile against Ukraine on November 21 in a strike targeting the city of Dnipro. Putin said at the time it was part of Moscow's response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil with U.S.-supplied ATACMS and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. The use of the Oreshnik 'is first and foremost a messaging and saber rattling kind of weapon. This is the sort of delivery system that's not cheap. It's not a battlefield sort of weapon,' Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told RFE/RL. Putin added on November 22 that the Oreshnik is new and not an upgrade of previous Soviet-designed weaponry. The United States said the new missile is 'experimental' and based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Ukraine initially accused Russia of having used an ICBM in the Dnipro attack. An ICBM has never been used in a war. Strategic Weapons Russia has been striking Ukraine with Iskanders, ground-launched, short-range ballistic missiles, and Kinzhals, air-launched, intermediate-range ballistic missiles, as well as various cruise missiles. Russia probably only has several units of the Oreshnik in stock, a U.S. official told media following the November 21 strike. Ukraine's military intelligence put the figure at up to 10 units.If Russia were to move forward with serial production of the Oreshnik, it would be for its nuclear force posture and not for use in a conventional war like the one with Ukraine, Karako said. 'This is not an alternative to a cruise missile. It's probably designed for strategic weapons,' he said. Zelenskiy's Response In his November 21 address to the nation announcing the use of the Oreshnik, Putin said that the missile traveled at a speed of Mach 10, or 2.5-3 kilometers per second, claiming that 'there are currently no ways of counteracting this weapon.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on November 22 that Ukraine was working on developing new types of air defenses to counter 'new risks,' a reference to missiles like the Oreshnik. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said testing a new weapon for the purposes of terror in another country was an 'international crime' and called for a worldwide 'serious response' to keep Russia from expanding the war. 'When someone starts using other countries not only for terror, but also for testing their new missiles through acts of terror, then this is clearly an international crime.' A lack of air defenses has been one of Ukraine's major weak spots in the 33-month war with Ukraine. Zelenskiy has called on the West to deliver more air defense systems since the first days of the invasion. He had also called on the West to ease restrictions preventing Ukraine from striking inside Russia with powerful long-range weapons. Zelenskiy said the deep strikes were necessary to target airfields critical for Russia's daily aerial attacks. The United States and the United Kingdom reportedly lifted the restrictions on November 17 with Ukraine using their long-range weapons -- ATACMS and Storm Shadow respectively -- to hit targets in Russia's regions of Belgorod and Kursk. Putin launched the Oreshnik into Ukraine to warn the West against arming Ukraine. Parliament Session Canceled Russia did not use the Oreshnik to strike Ukraine during another deadly air attack on November 22. Two people were killed and 12 wounded in Russian strikes on Sumy, Artem Kobzar, the mayor of the northeastern Ukrainian city, reported in a video statement on Telegram. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russian drone attacks were under way in four regions -- Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Zhytomyr. In the capital, which has been on edge for several days amid intense Russian attacks on Ukraine, lawmakers were advised to avoid the government district on November 22 and parliament canceled a scheduled session due to warnings of a potential missile strike. 'We were informed about the risk of a missile strike on the Verkhovna Rada in Kyiv in the coming days. Putin has significantly raised the stakes. Tomorrow's parliamentary session is canceled,' lawmaker Taras Batenko said. Oleksiy Honcharenko, another lawmaker, said on Telegram that the next session was now planned for December, although parliament leaders have not officially commented on the warnings. Zelenskiy's office assured the public that the presidential administration would continue operating 'as usual' on November 22.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuU3v2dZmQm4T	2024-11-22T15:42:37-08:00	
Myanmar: Rebels Capture Town On Main Road To Chinese-Built Port	Insurgents in western Myanmar have captured a town on a road junction leading to a Chinese-funded deep sea port, which is bound to raise new concern about the fate of an extensive development that includes energy pipelines running from the coast to southern China. The Myanmar junta that seized power in a 2021 coup has in recent weeks been reinforcing its defenses at the Kyaukpyu economic zone on the coast of Rakhine state, where China is building a port and energy facilities, including its cross-country natural gas and oil pipelines. Insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA), which is fighting for self-determination in Rakhine state, have made significant advances against the military over the past year, leaving junta forces confined to ever smaller pockets of territory, including Kyaukpyu. On Wednesday, AA fighters captured the town of Toungup, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southwest of Kyaukpyu on the main road links to central and southern parts of the country, after nearly a month of fighting. 'The AA has captured Toungup town and surrounding battalion bases,' a resident of the town, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals, told Radio Free Asia. 'In the city, the soldiers deserted and the AA is evacuating residents,' said the resident. Junta forces were attacking Toungup with aircraft and artillery and some houses were ablaze, residents said. Residents had no information about casualties. RFA tried to contact both the junta’s spokesperson in Rakhine state, Hla Thein, and the AA spokesperson, Khaing Thukha, to ask about the situation but neither responded by the time of publication. The AA has dealt the military some of the most devastating setbacks since the 2021 coup, seizing over half of state’s townships, naval and military bases and stretches of coast, including foreign development projects. The AA had been fighting for control over Toungup township since Nov. 4. The town was home to the military’s last operational command headquarters in Rakhine state, as well as the headquarters of several battalions, including an engineers battalion. The capture of the town represents the removal of a major obstacle for the AA if it decides to try to capture Kyaukpyu, a hub in China’s Belt and Road network of energy and infrastructure projects. The military has recently been sending reinforcements to Kyaukpyu, insurgent sources and residents said. The AA is also attacking the military in its last important bases in Rakhine state’s Ann and Gwa towns. Of Rakhine state’s 17 townships, the AA has captured 10, in addition to one in neighboring Chin state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuuaIpL6WnoxJF	2024-11-22T15:41:04-08:00	
US Weapons Delays Costly For Ukraine Yet Again – Analysis	By Luke Coffey US President Joe Biden last week finally allowed Ukraine to use American-made long-range missiles against targets inside the Russian Federation. In addition, the administration disclosed that, for the first time, the US would provide Kyiv with antipersonnel landmines — something Biden had been reluctant to do because of pressure from within his own party. Make no mistake: both these measures will have a positive impact on the battlefield, especially in the area surrounding Kursk Oblast. But the White House’s delay is concerning. For more than 100 days, Ukrainian soldiers have controlled a piece of Russian territory in this region. Ukraine’s decision to launch operations in Kursk back in August made perfect sense. By holding Russian territory, Ukrainian forces have forced Moscow to divert resources from other sections of the front line to Kursk and created bargaining power for any future negotiations. Furthermore, Ukraine’s success in this operation reminded the world that success is possible when the right weapons and support are provided. The capture of Russian territory also gave a much-needed morale boost to Ukrainians, who have endured slow but steady Russian advances along other parts of the front line. Yet, from the moment Ukraine launched its operation in Kursk, it had been asking for permission to use American-made missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Ukrainian officials knew that Russian forces were preparing a major counterattack. This threat became even more pressing with the arrival of more than 10,000 North Korean troops deployed to help Russia retake the territory Ukraine had captured. Throughout Russia’s buildup in the region, Ukraine was able to pinpoint where troops were staging and where supply points were located. Frustratingly, these targets were out of range for Ukraine’s existing weapons. Until this week, the US was unwilling to approve the use of its systems, fearing such actions might be viewed as escalatory by Moscow. This week’s decision to allow these weapons’ use, along with Washington’s agreement to supply antipersonnel mines to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, highlights a recurring theme: the US delivering aid to Ukraine too little, too late. This pattern has plagued America’s support for Ukraine since the early days of the war in 2022. To give credit where it is due, Biden rushed crucial aid to Ukraine in the early weeks of the conflict, enabling the successful defense of Kyiv and later counteroffensives. But for much of the war, Ukraine’s requests for critical weapons systems have gone unanswered — or have remained unfulfilled until the need became urgent. For example, from the start of the conflict, Ukraine requested the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, which proved to be highly effective. However, it was not until after Mariupol fell to Russian forces in May 2022 that the first HIMARS arrived. That summer, Ukraine repeatedly sought Patriot air defense systems to protect its skies. The US did not approve their transfer until Russia escalated airstrikes in October and November of that year. Even then, it took months to train Ukrainian forces to operate them, leaving the country vulnerable throughout the winter. Other delays affected the provision of cluster munitions, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and the long-range ATACMS missiles. While the US eventually authorized all these systems, its indecision cost Ukraine dearly, forcing it to respond reactively instead of proactively. So, how does Biden’s recent announcement affect Ukraine’s prospects in the war? Had these weapons been approved sooner, they could have disrupted some of Russia’s progress along the front lines. Now, their impact will likely be limited to the ongoing fighting around Kursk Oblast. Some critics argue that the timing is irresponsible, considering Biden is now a lame-duck president who will hand over power to Donald Trump in January. On the contrary, Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian targets actually strengthens Trump’s position in potential peace talks. These weapons give Trump an additional bargaining chip to pressure Moscow — a tool he would not otherwise have had. The White House’s delays in providing key military equipment is one reason why many Ukrainians are open to the idea of a Trump presidency. Few deny that Trump sincerely wants to end the war, though many are unsure how he intends to accomplish this. Ukrainians have grown increasingly frustrated with the current administration’s approach: providing just enough support to give the appearance of action, but not enough to ensure success. The delay in allowing Ukrainians to strike inside Russia is only the latest example of this hesitancy. This frustration has led some Ukrainians to consider gambling on Trump. Speculation even suggests that Trump, during his recent meeting with Biden, influenced the timing of this policy shift. While unconfirmed, it seems unlikely that the two leaders met without discussing Ukraine, one of the most pressing foreign policy challenges facing the US. If Trump is serious about bringing all sides to the negotiating table, his top priority should be getting Ukraine into a position of strength. Allowing Ukraine to target Russian command and control centers while disrupting supply chains is a critical first step. These actions could tilt the balance of power, paving the way for meaningful negotiations. The US’ reluctance to act decisively has undoubtedly prolonged the war and increased its costs. While the latest decision comes late, it still holds the potential to shape the outcome of the current battle in Kursk in a positive way. The lesson from this war is clear: timely aid can mean the difference between stalemate and success. The latest announcement, though overdue, underscores the importance of providing Ukraine with the tools it needs in a timely manner and not months after the fact. As the US undertakes a transfer of power, the coming months will be crucial for Ukraine. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Brazil: Bolsonaro Indicted By Federal Police For Coup Attempt	By Alex Rodrigues Brazil’s Federal Police have concluded their investigation into a criminal organization allegedly working to prevent President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin from assuming office in 2022, following the defeat of then-President Jair Bolsonaro in the presidential elections. In a statement released on Thursday (Nov. 21), the Federal Police confirmed that the final investigation report had been sent to the Supreme Court. Among the 37 individuals indicted for crimes including violent abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law, coup d'état, and criminal organization are former President Jair Bolsonaro; ex-Navy commander Almir Garnier Santos; federal representative Alexandre Ramagem (Liberal Party) and former director of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin); former Justice Minister Anderson Torres; ex-Institutional Security Cabinet Minister Augusto Heleno; Army Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former aide; Liberal Party president Valdemar Costa Neto; and former President’s Chief of Staff and Defense Minister Walter Souza Braga Netto. According to the Federal Police, the evidence against the individuals indicted was gathered over nearly two years through a range of investigative measures. These included telematics, telephone, banking, and tax record analysis, plea bargains, search and seizure operations, and other actions authorized by the Judiciary. The investigations revealed that the individuals involved were organized into distinct groups, each with specific responsibilities, including the Disinformation and Electoral System Attack Cell; the Military Incitement Cell; the Legal Cell; the Operational Cell Supporting Coup Activities; the Parallel Intelligence Cell; and the Operational Cell for Executing Coercive Measures. 'With the submission of the report [to the Supreme Court], the Federal Police are concluding their investigation into the attempted coup d'état and the violent overthrow of Democratic Rule of Law,' stated the police.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58AuudBdUR0M3bl9	2024-11-22T15:36:27-08:00	
Russia: Pentecostal Pastor, Buddhist In Pre-Trial Detention For A...	By Victoria Arnold A Pentecostal pastor has become the first person to be accused of publicly calling for actions 'against state security' for speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine from a religious perspective. Nikolay Romanyuk, senior presbyter of Holy Trinity Church in the Moscow Region town of Balashikha, gave a sermon in September 2022 in which he explicitly stated that believers should not go to fight in Ukraine 'on the basis of Holy Scripture'. If convicted, Pastor Romanyuk could face up to 6 years' imprisonment or a fine of up to 1 million Roubles (7 months' average Moscow wage) (see below). Investigators arrested Pastor Romanyuk after early-morning armed raids on his home and those of several other church members on 18 October 2024. Two days later, a court ruled that he should be detained for two months. He is currently being held in Investigation Prison No. 11 in Noginsk, 50 kms (30 miles) east of Moscow (see below). Because the sermon was livestreamed and then uploaded to the church's YouTube channel, Pastor Romanyuk is under investigation under Criminal Code Article 280.4, Part 2, Paragraph V – 'Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet' (see below). It remains unclear which investigative agencies carried out the raids on church members' home and initiated the criminal case against Pastor Romanyuk. Forum 18 sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the Federal Security Service (FSB). Forum 18 asked in what way Romanyuk's sermon threatened state security, why he had been placed in detention, whether any criminal or administrative cases had been opened against any other church members, and why it had been deemed necessary to carry out armed raids on their homes. Forum 18 has received no response (see below). While Pastor Romanyuk is the first religious figure to be charged under Criminal Code Article 280.4, small numbers of Russians who oppose the war on religious grounds continue to face prosecution under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'), Criminal Code Article 280.3 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, [and] maintain international peace and security'), and Criminal Code Article 207.3 (dissemination of 'false information' about the Armed Forces). Ilya Vasilyev, founder and director of the Moscow Zen Centre, is due to go on trial soon on charges of spreading 'knowingly false information' about the Russian Armed Forces 'on grounds of hatred or enmity' (Criminal Code Article 207.3, Part 2, Paragraph D). He is being prosecuted for an English-language Facebook post about Russian rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities. He made the post – and others for which he was previously prosecuted under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 – 'solely out of religious conviction', his lawyer told Forum 18. If convicted, Vasilyev could be imprisoned for 5 to 10 years or be fined 3 million to 5 million Roubles (see below). Vasilyev has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina Investigation Prison (see below). At a court hearing on 19 November 2024, where the judge extended Vasilyev's period in custody by six months, Vasilyev noted the difficulties of carrying out Buddhist rituals in the detention centre, but said in a message to supporters that he continues to meditate twice a week (see below). On 12 November, a court in Moscow fined Russian Orthodox Christian Aleksey Sevastyanenko 5 days' average Moscow wage under Article 20.3.3 for accusing President Vladimir Putin and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill of murdering civilians in Ukraine. During his conversation with his church's pro-war priest, Sevastyanenko stated: 'Thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house' (see below). Forum 18 asked the Moscow Interior Ministry in what way Sevastyanenko's statements had 'discredited' the Russian Armed Forces. Forum 18 received no response (see below). Charges and punishments President Vladimir Putin signed Criminal Code Article 280.4 into law on 14 July 2022. This was one of several new criminal offences designed to discourage and punish criticism of the authorities in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Part 1 punishes 'Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation' with the following possible penalties:– a fine of 100,000 to 500,000 Roubles;– 2 to 4 years' imprisonment, with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to three years. Part 2 covers the same offence when committed 'a) by a group of persons by prior conspiracy; b) by a person using their official position; v) using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet; g) for selfish motives or for hire; or d) motivated by political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or motivated by hatred or enmity towards any social group', and carries the following punishments: – a fine of 300,000 to 1 million Roubles; – 3 to 6 years' imprisonment with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to 5 years and with or without restriction of freedom for a period of 6 months to 2 years; On 4 March 2022, specific Criminal Code and Administrative Code penalties for 'discrediting' the Russian Armed Forces came into force, alongside criminal penalties for spreading 'false information' about the Armed Forces' actions (Criminal Code Article 207.3). Some of the punishments were increased on 28 March 2023. Although the government introduced Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 and the associated Criminal Code Article 280.3 on 4 March 2022 in order to punish 'discreditation' of the Armed Forces, amendments to the law on 25 March 2022 expanded the definition of this offence to include 'discreditation' of 'the execution by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers for the specified purposes', ie. protecting Russian interests and 'maintaining international peace and security'. The government has used a range of tactics to pressure religious leaders into supporting the renewed invasion of Ukraine. These tactics include warnings to senior and local religious leaders, and prosecuting and fining religious believers and clergy who have publicly opposed the war. Similar warnings and prosecutions have been used against many Russians who express opposition to the war for any reason. Since February 2022, courts have on criminal charges jailed two and fined three for opposing Russia's war in Ukraine on religious grounds. Another, independent Christian preacher from the Urals Eduard Charov, is under restrictions at home awaiting criminal trial on charges of repeatedly 'discrediting' the Russian armed forces and state bodies. Investigators have also opened three criminal cases against people who have left Russia. Many others have received administrative fines. The government has blocked websites that oppose the war on religious grounds, and those that report on the impact of the war on people and places of worship in Ukraine. It has also blocked websites of Ukrainian religious organisations. Romanyuk: 'Activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation' On 25 September 2022, at the first Sunday service after President Vladimir Putin announced the 'partial mobilisation' of Russian army reservists, Pastor Nikolay Nikolayevich Romanyuk (born 15 August 1962) gave a sermon at the Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church in Balashikha, calling on fellow believers not to take part in the war in Ukraine. Like other worship services at the church, the event was livestreamed on the church's YouTube channel and the recording was subsequently made available on YouTube and the Russian social network VKontakte. In October 2024, investigators (it is unclear from which state agency) opened a case against Romanyuk under Criminal Code Article 280.4, Part 2, Paragraph V ('Public calls to implement activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, or to obstruct the exercise by government bodies and their officials of their powers to ensure the security of the Russian Federation using mass media or electronic or information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet'). Investigators arrested Romanyuk – who studied at a Pentecostal seminary in Kyiv after the collapse of the USSR – on 18 October 2024 after searches of his home and those of other church members. At a closed hearing on 20 October, a judge at Balashikha City Court ordered that he should be kept in custody until 16 December (Romanyuk appealed unsuccessfully against the detention order on 12 November). It is unknown whether Romanyuk has yet been formally charged or when his case is likely to come to trial. The Memorial Human Rights Centre named him a political prisoner on 31 October 2024. Forum 18 sent enquiries to the Federal Investigative Committee, the Moscow Region Investigative Committee, and the Moscow Region branch of the FSB security service, asking in what way Romanyuk's sermon threatened state security, why he had been placed in detention, whether any criminal or administrative cases had been opened against any other church members, and why it had been deemed necessary to carry out armed raids on their homes. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Moscow of 21 November. Holy Trinity Church, which is a registered religious organisation, has several sister communities located in the outskirts of Moscow and Moscow Region. No other criminal cases appear to have been opened against any other clergy or church members so far. Romanyuk: Simultaneous armed raids Roman Zhukov, another pastor at Holy Trinity Church, described the early morning house raids on his Telegram channel on 24 October 2024. 'The conversation was softer with some, harsher with others,' he noted. He wrote that 'special forces soldiers' arrived at about 6.20 am on 18 October at his family's home, the Romanyuks', and the home of the Repins, another family from the church. Officials also conducted searches at the church itself and 'in Volokolamsk' (the church owns land in Volokolamsk District, where it runs children's camps). At the home of Ilya and Sergey Romanyuk (who are among Nikolay Romanyuk's adult sons), the armed men did not carry out a search but 'broke in and put the guys on the floor, where they lay for 12 hours, one and a half of which they spent in light indoor clothes and barefoot on the ground outside. At gunpoint'. At the other addresses, the troops 'entered with armoured shields, in some cases breaking the door frames; they made the men lie on the floor with their hands behind their heads; [and] seized digital devices and documents, Maksim Repin's bank cards, his mother's pension card, and foreign-travel passports'. Investigators asked Nikolay Romanyuk 'to make some statements on camera', which he refused to do. Investigators then took him away for questioning at about 6pm. 'The entire family has gone through great psychological trauma today, but such searches and arrests in modern Russia are predictable and expected – to our great regret', Ukrainian pastor Vladimir Franchuk, an acquaintance of the Romanyuk family, wrote in a blog post on 20 October 2024. 'One of the main accusations against Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk is that he expressed his disagreement with the bandit-like and cruel war that the Russian Federation is waging on the territory of Ukraine', Franchuk noted. 'Honourable and just people in Russia (believers and non-believers) suffer - and will suffer! - for their position as an honest person, which is deeply and consistently based on Biblical truth and the Christian worldview.' Romanyuk: 'Find me in the Old Testament even a hint that we could somehow participate.. This is not our war' The video of Pastor Nikolay Romanyuk's sermon has disappeared from the church's YouTube channel, but several other YouTube channels uploaded copies after the prosecution of Romanyuk became known. (Among these is the channel of Pastor Vyacheslav Boynetsky of the Slavic Christian Church in Salem, Oregon, who posted the sermon under the title 'For this sermon they arrested a pastor'.) Much of the 41-minute video is taken up by Pastor Romanyuk's sermon, during which he says: 'When you are offered a hit, when you are offered a bottle of alcohol or you are given a summons to send you to combat – this is the same sin, and the same drug, and the same Satan.. Find me in the Old Testament even a hint that we could somehow participate. And it does not matter which tsar calls for this – [whether] the Ukrainian tsar, the American tsar, or our tsar calls for this. I would like this to be a vaccination, at least in some way. This is not our war.' 'It was written in our doctrine that we are pacifists and cannot participate in this', Romanyuk continues. 'It is our right to profess this on the basis of Holy Scripture. We do not bless those who go there [to war]. [Those] who are taken by force, we do not bless them, but we pray that they are rescued from there. There are different legal ways to do this.' Nikolay Romanyuk is the brother of Vasily Romanyuk, who was pastor of the Holy Trinity Pentecostal Church when the Moscow city authorities bulldozed its building as an 'unlawful structure' in 2012, forcing the congregation to split across different locations. Vasily Romanyuk died in 2015. The church managed to find a new site and construct a new building in 2016. Pastor Romanyuk's address in detention is: 142412, g. Noginskul. 1-ya Revsobraniy 17FKU Sledstvenniy izolyator No. 11 UFSIN Rossii po Moskovskoy oblasti Vasilyev: Criminal trial of Buddhist leader The trial of computer programmer and Zen Buddhist Ilya Vladimirovich Vasilyev (born 9 December 1973) on charges of spreading 'false information' about the Russian Armed Forces is due to begin in Moscow on 3 December 2024. It had earlier been twice postponed. He has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina. Before his prosecution, Vasilyev had been on the point of taking his vows as a monk of the Soto Zen school. He has been director of the Moscow Zen Centre since 2010, and held regular meditation sessions at his home. Investigators opened the case against Vasilyev on 20 June 2024 under Criminal Code Article 207.3 ('Public dissemination, under the guise of credible statements, of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens [and] maintain international peace and security, or about the exercise by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers outside the territory of the Russian Federation for those purposes, as well as [knowingly false information] on the provision of assistance by volunteer formations, organisations or individuals in the performance of tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation'), Part 2, Paragraph D ('for reasons of political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or for reasons of hatred or enmity against any social group'). Criminal Code Article 207.3 Part 2 carries the following possible punishments: a fine of 3 million to 5 million Roubles; or up to 5 years' assigned work 'with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years'; or 5 to 10 years' imprisonment 'with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years'. According to the Investigative Committee charging decision of 16 October 2024, seen by Forum 18, the case is based on an English-language Facebook post of 25 December 2022: 'Putin rejected Christmas armistice. His rockets are right now shelling peaceful Ukrainian cities and towns. Only yesterday 16 people died in Kherson, where my father's family lives. Or lived? Millions of Ukrainians are now without electricity and water supply'. The Paragraph D charge derives from Vasilyev's alleged motivation of 'political hatred' for 'the current organs of executive and legislative power of the Russian Federation'. Vasilyev made the post, and others on VKontakte which led to an earlier administrative conviction, 'solely out of religious conviction', he told Forum 18 through his lawyer Gevorg Aleksanyan on 20 November. He added that he is 'not a politician and is engaged only in religion'. In a message to supporters, posted on the 'Ilya Vasilyev – support group' channel on Telegram on 20 November, Vasilyev wrote: 'It is unacceptable to be persecuted for posting on the internet, but this is happening under the new laws of the Russian Federation. One day the world will be a better place!' Vasilyev added: 'On a brighter note, I am in Moscow. I continue to meditate on Monday and Wednesday evenings. One way to support me – meditate with me on Wednesdays from 18.00 to 18.30 Moscow time. Unite in person and via video link and our practice will help to manifest the good that already exists, both in us and in the world!' Preobrazhensky District Court in Moscow scheduled the first hearing in Vasilyev's case for the 5 November, then for 19 November, but on both occasions Judge Valentina Lebedeva postponed it (in the latter case because Vasilyev was improperly notified of the hearing details). It is now due to take place on 3 December 2024. At the 19 November hearing, the judge extended Vasilyev's period of detention by six months to 24 April 2025 – he has been in detention since 22 June 2024, initially in Moscow's Kapotnya prison, then in Matrosskaya Tishina. Vasilyev and his lawyer had requested that he be placed under house arrest instead. They noted that 8 December is the day of Buddha's enlightenment, which Vasilyev had wanted to mark at home. Vasilyev: Earlier fine Ilya Vasilyev appears to have first come to investigative agencies' attention in early 2023, either because of his religious activities or because he had 'ended up on some list of unreliable Russians', as he commented to human rights group OVD-Info on 1 October 2024. The FSB security service examined his profile on the VKontakte social network on 4 February 2023, finding a number of anti-war comments. Police searched Vasilyev's flat on 11 May 2023, seized his phone, tablet computer, and laptop, and took him to a police station. There they charged him under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'). Moscow's Preobrazhensky District Court fined him 40,000 Roubles (1 week's average Moscow wage) the same day. According to the written protocol detailing the charges, police based this case on three statements in Russian from Vasilyev's VKontakte page (which he used under the name 'Arvi Hacker' ('Arvi Kheker')): 'No to war with Ukraine. Shame on Putin's thugs'; '#notowar'; and 'Russian army – out of Ukraine. Putin – out of the Kremlin! Russia did not choose you as president.' According to OVD-Info's 1 October 2024 account of his prosecution, after the administrative hearing, an investigator tried to question Vasilyev there and then in the court corridor about his activities on Facebook and Twitter. In response, Vasilyev cited Article 51 of the Constitution (according to which nobody is obliged to testify against themselves), then went home and deleted his social media accounts. Investigators had already found, however, two Facebook posts which formed the basis of the case they eventually opened on 20 June 2024 (only one of which they later cited in the indictment). They searched Vasilyev's home and arrested him the same day. Investigators sent the Facebook posts for psychological and linguistic examination by the 'Independent Expert' centre, whose 'expert analyses' have been used by the security services in similar cases against people who have spoken out against the war or otherwise opposed the authorities, including in the conviction of former Yekaterinburg mayor Yevgeny Roizman for 'repeat discreditation' of the Armed Forces. According to OVD-Info, Danila Mikheyev, the founder and sole employee of the 'Independent Expert' centre, was apparently fighting in the Russian army in Ukraine when he supplied the 'expert analysis' of the materials in Vasilyev's case. (Russia's Justice Ministry has conceded that Mikheyev does not have the necessary qualifications for linguistic expert analysis. In July 2024, the Federal Tax Service removed the Independent Expert centre from the Unified Register of Legal Entities as inactive.) Vasilyev's address in detention is: 107076 g. Moskvaul. Matrosskaya Tishina 18FKU Sledstvenniy izolyator No. 1 UFSIN Rossii po g. Moskve Moscow: Another 'discreditation' case On 12 November 2024, Moscow's Basmanny District Court fined 54-year-old Russian Orthodox Christian Aleksey Sevastyanenko 30,000 Roubles (5 days' average Moscow wage) under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 ('Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation'). His appeal was registered by the lower court on 18 November, but has not yet reached Moscow City Court. According to the written verdict, seen by Forum 18, on 10 November in the grounds of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Life-giving Trinity in Khokhly, Sevastyanenko 'spoke out against the SVO [special military operation] and accused the President of the Russian Federation and the Patriarch of murdering the civilian population in Ukraine .. in this way, [he] committed public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for the purposes of defending the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, [and] supporting international peace and security'. Sevastyanenko 'adheres to an anti-war position', his lawyer commented to the 'Ostorozhno, Moskva' Telegram channel on 19 November. 'That day, in the courtyard of the church, he raised this issue in the context of religious commandments'. According to Radio Liberty's Russian Service, he told the church's rector, Fr Andrey Tkachyov, that that support for the war in Ukraine goes against the commandments 'Thou shalt not kill' and 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house'. Sevastyanenko believes a fellow parishioner or a member of church staff then called the police, who detained him for several hours before releasing him with a summons to appear the next day for charging. On 11 November, police lodged a case against him under Article 20.3.3, Part 1 at Basmanny District Court. Judge Anna Rasskazova sent it back the same day, however, as officers had not produced proof of the defendant's identity and had cited the wrong Administrative Code Article on a document in the case materials, according to court documents seen by Forum 18. Police resubmitted the case on 12 November, when the same judge found Sevastyanenko guilty. Forum 18 asked the Moscow Interior Ministry on 18 November in what way Sevastyanenko's statements had 'discredited' the Russian Armed Forces. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Moscow of 21 November. Fr Andrey Tkachyov is known for his support of Russia's war in Ukraine. The Moscow Patriarchate sacked and defrocked his predecessor at the Trinity Church, Fr Aleksey Uminsky, in January 2024 over his criticism of its pro-war stance and his refusal to read the 'Prayer for Holy Rus' (Patriarch Kirill added this prayer to the liturgy after the invasion of Ukraine, to be read after the Gospel). The Ecumenical Patriarchate later restored Fr Aleksey's priestly status and he is now serving at a Russian church in Paris (not affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGczHp58Auualy6t3vn-8Y	2024-11-22T15:34:23-08:00	
Myanmar’s NUG: A Test Of Ethics And Gender Equality – Analysis	By Dr. Htet Khaing Min The recent sexual harassment case involving Salai Isaac Khen within Myanmar’s National Unity Government (NUG) highlights critical issues of gender equity, accountability, and ethical governance in the struggle for democracy. Key Takeaways: The NUG’s commitment to gender equality is under scrutiny following sexual harassment allegations against a key representative, revealing gaps in its internal accountability mechanisms. Myanmar’s patriarchal culture and the NUG’s position in an ongoing conflict complicate efforts to address gender-based violence effectively within its ranks. The international community’s support for the NUG should be conditioned on its demonstrated progress in implementing gender equity reforms and accountability measures. Since Myanmar’s 2021 coup, the National Unity Government (NUG) has emerged as a beacon of hope in the struggle for democratic governance, opposing the military junta’s oppression. Tasked with protecting human rights and restoring democratic values, the NUG faces public expectations to uphold high ethical standards, especially as it seeks international recognition as Myanmar’s legitimate government. However, a recent sexual harassment case involving Salai Isaac Khen, the NUG’s representative in India, has cast a shadow over this mission. This incident tests the NUG’s dedication to the principles of gender equity and accountability, questioning its ability to protect vulnerable populations within its ranks. This analysis dives into the context, implications, and necessary steps for reform within the NUG. Background: Gender Inequality in Myanmar Myanmar’s deeply rooted gender inequality is exacerbated by long-standing military rule, where women are often marginalized in both public and private sectors. Despite limited gains, like increased female representation to 16% in the 2020 elections, patriarchal norms still impede women’s involvement in decision making. Furthermore, women in conflict zones face widespread abuse from military personnel, as these areas often see the worst violations against female citizens. The lack of legislative protection against gender-based violence has perpetuated a climate of impunity, deepening the challenges women face in Myanmar. The NUG’s Position on Gender Equity Positioning itself as a progressive force for change, the NUG has touted its commitment to inclusivity and gender equality. With 24% of senior NUG roles held by women and the establishment of the Ministry of Women, Youth, and Children Affairs (MOWCYA), it has demonstrated a historic commitment to women’s representation. However, Khen’s alleged misconduct raises critical questions about whether the NUG’s policies on gender equity are implemented effectively or exist merely as symbolic gestures. The Case of Salai Isaac Khen Salai Isaac Khen, a former advocate for gender equality, allegedly harassed a female secretary who worked at the NUG's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in India. According to reports, the harassment began shortly after her employment started in April 2023, escalating as her requests to resign were initially dismissed. Beyond sexual advances, Khen allegedly assigned personal tasks unrelated to her role, which created a toxic and exploitative work environment. An internal investigation led the NUG’s Policy Central Committee to conclude that Khen’s actions were inappropriate, resulting in his dismissal on August 1st, 2024. The allegations of sexual harassment against Issac Khen cast a stark shadow of hypocrisy, especially given his public image as a prominent advocate for gender rights, human rights, and women’s empowerment. Known for his research and publications on gender-based violence and equality, Khen’s actions sharply contradict his own purported values. However, on October 8, Khen publiclydenied the allegations, claiming that the investigation was flawed and that he was not afforded a fair process. In his public denial, Khen asserted that he was not involved in any actions violating PSHEA’s (Protection from Sexual Harassment, Exploitation, and Abuses) sexual harassment policy. He contended that the investigation team never questioned him about specific allegations, such as inappropriate comments or advances. Khen further claimed that some witnesses gave false testimony, aiming to damage his reputation through social media and false statements. Despite the PSHEA policy permitting an appeal, Khen stated that he was denied this right after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs completed its inquiry, a move that he argues violated procedural fairness. Impact on NUG’s Credibility The allegations against Khen come at a critical juncture for the NUG, which seeks domestic and international legitimacy. This incident risks alienating the NUG’s core supporters, including women and civil society organizations integral to Myanmar’s resistance movements. Also, this erosion of trust underscores the necessity for the NUG to implement robust accountability mechanisms that align with its commitment to human rights. Broader Context of Gender-Based Violence in Myanmar’s Conflict Myanmar’s military has long employed sexual violence as a weapon against women, particularly in ethnic conflict areas. Women’s rights groups report routine abuses by military personnel, with many survivors reluctant to come forward due to cultural stigma and fear of reprisal. Unfortunately, gender-based violence is not limited to the military; some resistance groups have also been implicated in abuses, further challenging the NUG’s moral authority. Resistance forces have also been implicated in cases of abuse, as highlighted by incidents of rape and murder by NUG-linked defense groups. For example, in May 2023, NUG pursued legal action against Aung Min, an NLD official, for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl in a Mae Sot safe house for Myanmar dissidents. After the child’s mother, a former teacher involved in Myanmar's Civil Disobedience Movement reported the assault to NUG officials, the NUG collaborated with Thai authorities for the arrest. He was arrested swiftly by the Ministry of Home Affairs, reportedly escaped detention, and has not been found since. While the victim and her mother have been relocated for safety, public frustration over delayed action has escalated, with advocates urging NUG accountability and justice for the victim. Another disturbing incident in Chaung-U Township, Sagaing Region, highlights the urgent need for the NUG to address sexual violence within its forces. In August 2022, NUG-linked resistance fighters executed seven civilians, including three underage girls who were raped before being killed. While the NUG has acknowledged the unlawful killings, it has failed to address the horrific sexual violence perpetrated by its own forces. And other abuse cases have also emerged, such as a Rohingya woman who fled to Bangladesh and was raped by Arakan Army (AA) soldiers, while they killed her husband. Such cases illustrate a disturbing normalization of violence, where even revolutionary factions adopt brutal tactics historically associated with the junta. Cultural and Social Barriers In Myanmar, patriarchal traditions often pressure women to endure harassment silently, discouraging them from reporting abuses due to societal stigma. Women face severe criticism and victim-blaming, especially in cases of sexual violence, with expectations of obedience to cultural norms that view them as protectors of family honor. This cultural backdrop further complicates the NUG’s challenge in implementing gender-equitable policies, as deep-rooted biases continue to discourage victims from speaking out. Policy Gaps and the Need for Reform While the NUG has taken some initial steps to address gender-based violence through the PSHEA policy, Khen’s case reveals severe gaps in enforcement. Women’s organizations have called for independent investigative bodies to handle harassment cases within the NUG transparently and effectively. Establishing credible processes for reporting, investigating, and addressing abuse allegations will demonstrate the NUG’s commitment to a gender-responsive government structure, restoring public confidence in its ethical integrity. Moving Forward To rebuild its credibility and affirm its commitment to gender equality, Myanmar’s NUG should implement critical reforms. First, precise reporting mechanisms should be established, enabling victims to report harassment confidentially without fear of retaliation. Next, enforce accountability through strict disciplinary actions against offenders at all levels, demonstrating a zero-tolerance policy toward gender-based violence. Additionally, mandatory gender sensitivity training should be introduced to promote respectful workplace conduct and prevent future incidents. Finally, collaborate with women’s rights organizations to create safe environments for women and include their perspectives in policy-making, ensuring their voices are genuinely represented. Role of the International Community Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Myanmar have led to a rise in gender-based violence, especially affecting displaced women and girls. While Ukraine's developed infrastructure and international support allow for comprehensive support systems for victims, including crisis hotlines, shelters, and counseling services, Myanmar's NUG faces limitations in providing adequate care. NUG should learn from Ukraine's approach and strengthen international collaborations to improve its response. The international community, including governments and NGOs that support the NUG, can play a vital role in promoting these reforms. International humanitarian agencies should condition financial aid and diplomacy on the NUG’s demonstrated progress toward gender equity, reinforcing the importance of human rights within the government-in-exile. Such conditions would compel the NUG to take meaningful action, ensuring its policies are not merely rhetorical. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for the NUG’s Commitment to Gender Equity The sexual harassment case within the NUG is a pivotal moment in Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement, demanding transparency, accountability, and tangible reforms from the NUG. Addressing this incident decisively would signal to both Myanmar’s citizens and the international community that the NUG stands firmly against abuse, embodying the ethical standards it claims to uphold. The NUG Human Rights Ministry should establish a digital reporting system for sexual abuse cases to facilitate victim reporting. Collaborating with the Women's Ministry can also enhance collective efforts to address this issue. By embracing these reforms, the NUG can reinforce its image as a genuine advocate for human rights and equality, advancing Myanmar’s path toward a democratic society that values all voices. This case underscores the urgency of addressing systemic gender-based violence, ensuring that the NUG remains a trusted symbol of ethical governance in a country that desperately needs it.

Beyond Guns And Ships: India’s ‘Soft Power’ Strategy In Maritime ...	While cultural elements like yoga, Bollywood, cuisine, and spirituality have historically shaped India's international image, a modern dimension has emerged within its strategic framework, leveraging maritime soft power. In recent years, the Indian Navy has assumed a central role in India's humanitarian outreach and maritime diplomacy through Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This shift emphasises India's ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family) and enhances its reputation on the global stage by projecting security, resilience, and regional solidarity. Under the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) initiative, maritime diplomacy is now a cornerstone of Indian foreign policy, positioning the Indian Navy as a vehicle for goodwill and cooperative engagement. Here is how the Indian Navy fortifies India's global influence through a balanced soft and hard power approach and advances its interests across the IOR. Pioneering HADR Operations: India's capacity for HADR operations was first spotlighted during the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, where the Indian Navy's rapid response exemplified its commitment to regional solidarity. The deployment of 40 ships, 42 helicopters, and 35 aircraft to various disaster-affected locations in India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Indonesia marked the beginning of India's role as a regional 'first responder.' Since then, operations like Madad, Rainbow, and Castor have demonstrated India's dedication to swift and effective humanitarian relief. In 2008, the Navy's response to Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar strengthened India's humanitarian identity. Later missions like Operation Neer in the Maldives (2014) highlighted India's adaptability in addressing diverse regional crises. These efforts have cemented India's reputation for HADR capabilities and extended its influence across the IOR. India as a 'First Responder' in the IOR: The Navy's consistent humanitarian support to neighbouring countries highlights its role as a first responder. Noteworthy missions include aid to Sri Lanka during Cyclone Roanu (2016) and to Mozambique in 2019, demonstrating a commitment to timely disaster relief. These actions display logistical capacity and reinforce India's dedication to the welfare of neighbouring nations, a core component of its soft power strategy. Expanding Capacity for HADR: To enhance its HADR capabilities, the Indian Navy has upgraded medical facilities, invested in technology, and expanded its fleet's adaptability for disaster response. Technological advancements like satellite communications and UAVs have strengthened situational awareness, allowing quicker and more coordinated interventions. This comprehensive approach positions India as both a capable and compassionate regional leader. Strategic Foundations: SAGAR and Neighbourhood First: Launched in 2015, India's SAGAR initiative articulates a vision for regional stability and shared growth, with the Indian Navy playing a vital role in safeguarding the IOR. SAGAR exemplifies India's commitment to a secure and prosperous regional environment through regular patrols, capacity-building initiatives, and resource-sharing. Neighbourhood First and Act East Policies: Aligned with SAGAR, India's 'Neighbourhood First' and 'Act East' policies emphasise security cooperation and friendly relations with neighbouring countries. Through naval resource sharing, humanitarian aid, and training programs, India has cultivated strong ties with Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Myanmar, and other IOR nations. These collaborative efforts demonstrate India's vision of a stable Indian Ocean, where regional partners benefit from Indian expertise and resources. Capacity and Capability Building: India as a Preferred Security Partner Training and Resource Sharing: A critical component of India's maritime soft power is its investment in training regional navies. Each year, the Indian Navy trains approximately 1,000 personnel from smaller neighbouring forces, fostering security knowledge and regional camaraderie. This cooperation strengthens the capacities of IOR nations to manage their maritime challenges while reinforcing India's image as a partner in regional security. Asset Transfers and Long-Term Support: India's provision of naval assets to regional partners further solidifies its role as a security partner. In recent years, India has been transferring offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) and other assets to countries like Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and the Maldives. Adhering to a 'Womb to Tomb' principle, India provides maintenance and operational support for these assets, fostering trust and ensuring long-term collaboration in maritime security. Showcasing India's Maritime Diplomacy Through Major Initiatives High-Level Maritime Engagements and Exercises: High-profile engagements, such as the 2016 International Fleet Review and the biannual Milan exercises, reflect India's commitment to maritime collaboration. The Milan exercises, for instance, involve over 40 countries and promote the themes of 'Camaraderie, Cohesion, Collaboration.' By fostering these multilateral engagements, India reinforces its position as a trusted and collaborative regional partner. The Information Fusion Centre - Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR): Since 2018, the IFC-IOR in Gurugram has facilitated real-time maritime information sharing among 25 nations, enhancing maritime domain awareness and supporting efforts against piracy, illegal fishing, and smuggling. Hosting liaison officers from multiple countries, IFC-IOR embodies India's commitment to a secure and open Indo-Pacific, strengthening its leadership in maritime diplomacy. The Role of Technological Advances in Expanding India's Soft Power Integration of Advanced Systems: India's adoption of strategic technology has significantly bolstered its HADR, NEO, and SAR capabilities. Satellite-based communication, UAVs for surveillance, and advanced maritime radars improve crisis response and showcase India as a technologically capable humanitarian force. High-Impact Operations as a Technological Showcase: India's technological capabilities have been demonstrated in critical operations, such as the 2017 rescue of the merchant vessel MSC Daniela off Sri Lanka and anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden. These operations, backed by advanced technology, project India's competence and reliability as a maritime power. Leveraging Maritime Diplomacy to Reinforce India's Image as a Global Leader Building Trust Through Crisis Response: Operations like Samudra Setu, which repatriated citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent efforts to supply critical medical materials under Samudra Setu II highlight India's commitment to global humanitarianism. Additionally, evacuations from conflict zones such as Sudan in 2023 underline India's dedication to the welfare of its citizens and its capacity to respond effectively in crises. Strengthening Diplomatic Ties Through Non-Partisan Humanitarian Efforts: India's impartial humanitarian missions, including rescuing Pakistani sailors from Somali pirates, underline its commitment to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. By offering aid regardless of geopolitical divides, India fosters regional goodwill and strengthens diplomatic ties. Future Supervisions and Strategic Implications Enhancing HADR Capabilities for Greater Reach: To broaden its humanitarian reach, the Indian Navy is exploring ways to enhance its HADR resources. Potential expansions include developing specialised HADR ships, increasing relief storage, and augmenting water purification and medical facilities on ships. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining India's role as a first responder in the IOR. Strategic Implications of India's Soft Power in the IOR: India's robust HADR, SAR, and NEO operations continue strengthening its influence within the IOR. As a stabilising force, India's growing presence supports the Free and Open Indo-Pacific agenda, positioning it as a counterbalance to other major maritime powers while reinforcing its image as a compassionate and stabilising force. The Indian Navy's soft power initiatives, from disaster relief to strategic capacity-building, have established India as a benevolent regional leader committed to security, humanitarianism, and cooperation. By blending hard and soft power, India embodies the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam philosophy, fostering stability in the IOR and enhancing its global standing as a responsible, stabilising force. This strategy promotes regional harmony and significantly positions India to shape a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjYjwOP08pqdw	2024-11-22T08:36:17-08:00	
What’s Driving Decreasing Gasoline Consumption In China? – Analys...	(EIA) -- Gasoline consumption in China has begun to fall in recent months amid increased sales of electric vehicles, slow economic growth, and population decline. We estimate gasoline consumption in China averaged 3.2 million barrels per day (b/d) in August 2024, 14% less than in August 2023. The trend continued in September and October, which were down from the same months in 2023. From January through July of this year, more gasoline was consumed in China than the year before. These trends led us to reduce our forecast growth in consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels in China in 2024 and 2025 in our Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). China’s growth of 0.1 million b/d in 2024 and 0.3 million b/d in 2025 will mostly be driven by petrochemical feedstocks instead of transportation fuels, reflecting increased petrochemical manufacturing in the country. Combined sales of hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles (BEV) were more than half of total passenger vehicle sales in China in October 2024, according to Bloomberg data. This share of sales is up from 40% in October 2023. Credit: EIA Although increased BEV and plug-in hybrid sales are only one factor moderating recent gasoline consumption in China, continued market penetration of these vehicles could weigh on the future of gasoline consumption. In China, typically between 20 million and 25 million passenger vehicles are sold every year. In the future, depending on future sales trends and the number of internal combustion engines decommissioned, BEVs and hybrids could make up a large portion of the total vehicle fleet in China. Although we do not forecast consumption for individual petroleum products such as gasoline or diesel in countries other than the United States in our STEO, we factor in fundamental shifts that affect petroleum product consumption in our forecasts. In China, increased sales of BEV and hybrid vehicles, a declining population, and slower economic growth have limited growth in gasoline consumption. Based on the latest forecast from Oxford Economics, China’s GDP is expected to grow by 4.1% in 2025, which is slower than the 6.7% GDP growth rate average from 2015 to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil consumption correlates with economic activity, and slower GDP growth could also be limiting gasoline consumption. In addition, China’s population has begun to decline, which may reduce total miles driven and gasoline consumption. China’s National Bureau of Statistics and General Administration of Customs publish monthly data on crude oil refinery processing, refined petroleum product output, crude oil and petroleum product imports, and crude oil and petroleum product exports. The agencies do not publish inventory levels or stock changes. Because of this exclusion, we calculate China’s apparent demand of gasoline as refinery production of gasoline plus imports minus exports. This calculation is different from product supplied, our proxy for consumption in the United States, which accounts for stock changes. Despite lacking inventory data, China’s monthly petroleum statistics can serve as a useful guide for general trends in the country’s petroleum market.

The Influence Of Baloch Student Unions In Promoting Separatism An...	Baluchistan, one of Pakistan’s most resource-rich yet underdeveloped provinces, has been plagued by unrest for decades. While genuine grievances of the Baloch people warrant attention, the activities of certain Baloch student unions have raised significant concerns. Groups like the Baloch Student Organization-Azad (BSO-A), Baloch Student Council (BSC), and Baloch Student Action Committee (BSAC) have allegedly become breeding grounds for extremism and separatism under the guise of advocating for nationalism and student rights. Their influence not only fosters divisiveness but also disrupts the academic and social development of Baloch youth. Student unions have historically played a vital role in advocating for rights and fostering political awareness. However, some factions of Baloch student unions have deviated from these ideals. Organizations like BSO-A and BSAC have reportedly been linked to militant outfits like the Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA). These unions often use university campuses as recruitment grounds, targeting impressionable students with narratives of victimization and nationalism. Instead of promoting peaceful dialogue, these groups perpetuate the notion that violence and separatism are the only solutions to Baluchistan’s challenges. Under the banner of Baloch nationalism, these student unions propagate anti-state sentiments, portraying Pakistan as an oppressor. While nationalism in itself is not inherently negative, these groups manipulate it to justify their extremist agendas. They pollute the minds of young Baloch students, instilling hatred for other ethnicities and discouraging harmonious coexistence. This not only undermines national unity but also jeopardizes the educational and professional prospects of these students. Baloch student unions frequently disrupt the peaceful environment of universities, particularly in Baluchistan. They organize protests, sit-ins, and demonstrations, often forcing students to participate under threat or coercion. This culture of intimidation extends to female students, who are pressured to join these activities as a symbolic 'soft face' to garner public sympathy. Such actions not only hinder academic progress but also create an atmosphere of fear and instability on campuses. Education is a powerful tool for empowerment, but the disruptive activities of Baloch student unions undermine its potential in Baluchistan. There have been reports of these unions interfering with classes, examinations, and academic schedules. By keeping students away from education, these groups deprive them of opportunities to improve their socio-economic conditions and contribute positively to society. This deliberate strategy ensures a steady supply of disillusioned youth for their separatist agenda. The psychological manipulation of young, impressionable students is a key tactic employed by these unions. A recent case highlights this disturbing trend. Talat Aziz, a third-semester political science student at Punjab University, revealed that he was coerced into joining a BLA training camp after being recruited at a Baloch Youth Council (BYC) protest. He admitted that a girl he met at the protest played a significant role in convincing him, and peer pressure from his fellow students further fueled his decision. Such cases underscore how Baloch student unions exploit vulnerabilities to recruit individuals for extremist activities. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that balances enforcement with socio-economic development. Below are some recommendations to mitigate the influence of these unions: University administrations and law enforcement agencies should collaborate to monitor and counter the disruptive activities of extremist student unions. Strict action must be taken against individuals or groups found inciting violence or promoting separatist ideologies. The government and educational institutions should encourage the formation of inclusive student organizations that focus on academic, cultural, and extracurricular activities. These platforms can provide students with constructive outlets for their energy and ambitions. The grievances of Baloch youth often stem from genuine socio-economic disparities. Addressing these issues through targeted development programs, scholarships, and job opportunities can reduce the appeal of extremist ideologies. The government and civil society should launch awareness campaigns to educate students about the dangers of extremist ideologies. Highlighting success stories of Baloch individuals who have excelled in education and professional fields can inspire others to follow suit. Many students targeted by these unions suffer from psychological manipulation and peer pressure. Providing counseling services in educational institutions can help vulnerable students resist coercion and make informed decisions. While enforcement measures are necessary, a long-term solution requires dialogue and reconciliation. Engaging with moderate voices within the Baloch community and addressing their legitimate concerns can help build trust and reduce support for extremist groups. The activities of Baloch student unions like BSO-A, BSC, and BSAC pose a serious threat to the peace and progress of Baluchistan and Pakistan as a whole. By exploiting young minds, these groups perpetuate a cycle of hatred, violence, and underdevelopment. It is imperative for the government, civil society, and educational institutions to work together to counter this menace. Through a combination of strict enforcement, socio-economic development, and awareness campaigns, Baloch youth can be empowered to reject extremism and contribute positively to their communities and the nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjY83ZgXm-4UF	2024-11-22T08:31:17-08:00	
Attock Cement Takeaways From Analyst Briefing – OpEd	Attock Cement Pakistan (ACPL) held its corporate briefing to discuss its FY24 and 1QFY25 financial results and future outlook. Following are the key highlights: Company posted topline of PKR28.5 billion for FY24 as compared to PKR25.4 billion for FY23, up 12%YoY, mainly due to higher offtakes. Company’s earnings were reported at PKR3.6 billion (EPS: PKR25.9) for FY24 as against PKR1.5 billion (EPS: PKR11.0) for FY23. The said increase was largely attributed to divestment gains of PKR4.3 billion (pre-tax) from the sale of its subsidiary, ‘Saqr Al Keetan Cement production company in Iraq for US$23.4 million. Earnings for 1QFY25 were recorded at PKR62 million (EPS: PKR0.45) as compared to PKR1.5 billion (EPS: PKR11.23) for the same period last year, down 96%YoY. Cement industry's total dispatches increased by 1%YoY to 45.3 million tons, though overall utilization levels fell to 55% in FY24 as compared to 60% in FY23. ACPL’s local dispatches were recorded at 1.2 million tons, down by 9%YoY. Meanwhile, export dispatches increased by 57%YoY to 1.0 million tons, on the back of 77%YoY higher clinker exports. Subsequently, total dispatches increased by 14%YoY to 2.3 million tons. Moreover, offtakes rose by 1%YoY in 1QFY25, with local dispatches dropping by 21%Yoy but exports increasing by 42%YoY. Management stated that company primarily rely on imported coal, constituting 85-90% of their coal mix. While, local coal component is limited to 10-15% due to its higher sulfur content. Company’s retention prices in FY24 averaged PKR14,700/ton, up from PKR13,400/ton in FY23. Meanwhile, export retention prices decreased to PKR9.400/ton from PKR10.400/ton. Consequently, weighted average retention prices for FY24 declined to PKR12.200/ton from PKR12.400/ton for the same period last year, given a higher export mix. Production cost increased to PKR10.000/ton in FY24, from PKR9.600/ton in FY23. Wherein, fuel cost reduced to PKR5,000/ton from PKR5,200/ton in FY23, due to efficient coal mix and higher efficiency of Line-4. However, power cost increased due to a 39%YoY increase in power tariff. Current clinker exports price hovered at US$30/ton, whereas cement export prices were US$40/ton. Meanwhile, MRP in the local market was PKR1,350/bag or PKR27,000/ton. Company power mix comprises 38% coal-fired boilers, 30% Waste Heat Recovery (WHR), 13-15% solar, and the remainder from grid tariff. Company's current capacity stands at 4.3 million ton following the addition of Line-4 in FY24. Management stated that the company is setting up a 4.8MW wind power plant, which is expected to be commissioned by 3QFY25. Management expects local cement demand to improve in the coming months. Additionally, the company is striving to secure orders with positive contribution margins despite the prevailing lower export prices.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjby51QE7HLhO	2024-11-22T08:27:09-08:00	
Body Image Of Women: Changing Concept And Updates – OpEd	For women, body image is a complex and deeply personal issue that is influenced by multiple factors, including cultural ideals, media portrayals, family, peers, and individual psychological factors. The key points about body image in women include: a. Cultural and Societal Influences: Societal standards of beauty often emphasize certain body types, skin tones, and features as ideal, which can lead women to feel pressured to conform. Historically, these standards have shifted – from the fuller-figured ideals of the Renaissance, to the thinness celebrated in the 90s, to the 'fit' and 'curvy' ideals promoted today. Advertising, movies, and social media often showcase a narrow standard of beauty that may not reflect the diversity of real women’s bodies. This has contributed to an unrealistic and often unattainable image of what women 'should' look like. b. Media and Social Media Impact: Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok can have a mixed impact on body image. They provide a platform for self-expression but also intensify body image concerns by exposing women to edited images, filters, and an endless stream of idealized bodies. This can lead to comparison, self-doubt, and negative self-esteem. Influencers and celebrities play a role in promoting certain body standards, although there has been a growing trend toward body positivity and inclusivity in recent years. c. Body Positivity and Body Neutrality Movements: The body positivity movement encourages acceptance and celebration of all body types, aiming to reduce stigma around larger bodies and to challenge societal beauty standards. Body neutrality goes a step further by promoting the idea that bodies don’t have to be loved or celebrated; instead, it emphasizes viewing the body as functional and focusing less on appearance. d. The Role of Family and Peers: Family and friends often influence body image. Comments, even if well-intentioned, can shape how women see their bodies. Positive reinforcement of diverse body types can improve body image, while critical comments can lead to negative self-perception. Peer pressure, especially among younger women and teenagers, can also be strong, with comparisons and insecurities fuelled by trends in fashion and beauty. Body image is a dynamic, multifaceted issue that affects women differently based on their personal experiences and societal context. Conversations about body image are moving toward promoting self-acceptance, inclusivity, and a focus on health and well-being rather than solely appearance. Development of the concept The concept of body image has evolved over time, shaped by changes in cultural standards, psychological research, and shifts in media representation. An overview of the concept include: a. Early Views: The term 'body image' was first introduced by neurologist Paul Schilder in the 1930s. He described body image as the mental representation one has of their physical self. Schilder explored how this image is influenced by social interactions and emotions, laying the groundwork for understanding body image as a psychological construct. b. 1980s–1990s: Body Image and Eating Disorders: In the 1980s and 1990s, studies highlighted a strong link between body image dissatisfaction and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Researchers started to recognize the harmful effects of media portrayals on women’s self-esteem and mental health. c. 2000s: Body Positivity and Critical Media Literacy: With the rise of the internet and social media in the early 2000s, body image issues became more visible and widely discussed. Online communities started promoting body positivity, which encourages people to accept and celebrate diverse body shapes and sizes. Researchers and activists promoted critical media literacy, encouraging individuals to question and resist unrealistic portrayals of beauty in the media. This included a shift towards valuing the functionality of the body, moving beyond appearance-based assessments. d. 2020s: Inclusivity and the Shift Towards Holistic Well-being: Recently, body image discussions have broadened to include diverse body types, skin tones, abilities, and gender identities. Brands and media outlets are increasingly featuring a wider range of bodies, challenging traditional beauty ideals. The concept of body neutrality has gained traction as an alternative to body positivity. While body positivity focuses on loving one’s body, body neutrality emphasizes reducing the focus on physical appearance altogether, valuing the body as a functional entity and shifting focus to well-being. e. Psychological and Social Impact of Evolving Body Image Concepts: Over time, research has revealed the deep connection between body image and mental health, especially among women. Negative body image is linked with issues like depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, whereas a positive body image is associated with better psychological resilience and satisfaction. The growing emphasis on holistic well-being encourages individuals to prioritize health and mental peace over conforming to physical ideals, reflecting a more inclusive and balanced approach to body image. In summary, body image as a concept has evolved from simple self-perception to a complex, socially influenced idea intertwined with cultural values, psychological health, and media representations. Challenges of body image The concept of body image presents a number of challenges, especially as it intersects with societal pressures, mental health, and personal self-worth. Some of the most significant challenges related to body image include: a. Unrealistic Beauty Standards: Media Influence: Media and advertising often promote narrow and unrealistic standards of beauty, portraying idealized images that are difficult, if not impossible, for most people to achieve. This creates a constant pressure to conform to these standards. Changing Trends: Beauty standards are constantly shifting (e.g., thinness in the 90s vs. a more curvy ideal today), making it challenging for individuals to maintain a stable or positive self-image. b. Impact of Social Media and Filters: Social Comparison:Social media encourages comparison, as people are frequently exposed to images of others who may present their most polished or edited selves. This comparison can lead to body dissatisfaction, particularly among young users. c. Limited Representation and Diversity: Lack of Inclusive Images:Although representation is improving, traditional media has historically presented a narrow view of beauty that excludes many body types, skin tones, ages, and abilities. This lack of representation reinforces stereotypes about what constitutes an 'acceptable' or 'desirable' body. d. Intersection with Gender and Societal Expectations: Gendered Body Standards:While women often face pressures around thinness, youth, and curviness, men also experience pressures around muscularity, strength, and height. These gendered expectations create unique challenges for different groups. e. Economic and Social Pressures: Commercialization of Body Image: Industries capitalize on body image insecurities by marketing products that claim to improve appearance, from weight-loss programs to cosmetic enhancements. This commercialization can intensify dissatisfaction by constantly reminding people of their perceived 'flaws. Addressing these challenges requires a societal shift toward inclusivity, education, and a focus on health and well-being that values each person as more than their appearance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjTXUzSm7OO-v	2024-11-22T08:22:20-08:00	
Bridging Continents: Insights From Ambassadors Of Turkey, Turkmen...	The Turkish (Faruk Kaymakçı), Turkmen (Sapar Palvanov), and Kazakh (Margulan Baimukhan) ambassadors delivered speeches during the event 'Supply Chains and Transport Corridors: Towards Greater Connectivity' organized in Brussels by the European Neighbourhood Council (ENC) and the Economic Development Foundation of Türkiye (IKV). Diplomatic World's Central Asia specialist Derya Soysal attended the event alongside Managing Director Barbara Dietrich, Director Alberto Turkstra. Key Points from the Turkish Ambassador, Faruk Kaymakçı Ambassador Kaymakçı emphasized that the EU is a key contributor to connectivity and highlighted the importance of the Trans-Caspian Corridor. He underlined Türkiye’s strategic position, bordering both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and the investments made by Türkiye over the past 20 years to strengthen Euro-Asian connectivity. He pointed out Türkiye’s connections with Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia, stressing that Europe should not exclude Türkiye from its connectivity projects. According to him, Türkiye is more aligned with Europe than Nicosia or Georgia. Kaymakçı also highlighted the shared challenges faced by Europe and Türkiye, emphasizing their obligation to work together. He called for facilitated visa processes to enhance trade and for quicker access to markets to boost economic cooperation. Key Points from the Turkmen Ambassador, Sapar Palvanov Ambassador Palvanov highlighted Turkmenistan’s investments in the Trans-Caspian Corridor and its cooperation with key partners such as the EU. He stated that, as a country located between two continents and amid the current complex regional situation, Turkmenistan fully understands the urgency of improving transport routes connecting Europe and Asia. He stressed that Turkmenistan is taking decisive, comprehensive measures, working closely with the EU and other key stakeholders to address these challenges. Regarding EU cooperation, he announced the successful launch of a Coordination Platform on Transport between the EU and Central Asia, aimed at facilitating trade and connectivity, reducing transit times, and attracting strategic investments. The ambassador also highlighted Turkmenistan’s key infrastructure projects, noting that the country has invested over $15 billion in recent years to develop roads, ports, railways, and airports, enhancing both regional and international connectivity. Among these, the Turkmenbashi International Port stands out as a flagship project, capable of handling up to 25 million tons of cargo annually. Palvanov noted Turkmenistan’s collaboration with European partners, including the Port of Antwerp and the Antwerp Maritime Academy, to integrate best practices in port management. Furthermore, Sapar Palvanov emphasized that the Turkmen government is working to advance infrastructure development within the framework of its national development strategy. He cited a notable example: the recently completed Ashgabat-Turkmenabat high-speed highway, which spans 600 kilometers and accelerates the transit of goods while strengthening regional ties. Additionally, he highlighted the modernization of more than 5,000 kilometers of railway lines, ensuring reliable transportation both nationally and internationally. He also mentioned Turkmenistan’s collaboration with the European Commission and European financial institutions for the construction of a new railway line connecting Turkmenabad and Turkmenbashi. Palvanov further added that Turkmenistan aims to attract investments and create a favorable climate for investment in the transport sector through initiatives such as the CASCA+ project and its participation in the EU Coordination Platform. He concluded by emphasizing the country’s participation in the CASCA+ Multimodal Transport Project, a seamless route connecting Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and Anatolia to Europe. This project involves national railways from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Türkiye, and Uzbekistan, creating a vital multimodal link. Key Points from the Kazakh Ambassador, Margulan Baimukhan Ambassador Baimukhan underscored that the Trans-Caspian Corridor is one of the most important routes for connecting Europe and Asia. He highlighted how investments in connectivity have boosted Kazakh trade, leading the government to allocate significant funding to transport infrastructure—$35 billion more will be invested next year. The ambassador stressed the need for ports to be better connected, emphasizing the importance of Kazakhstan’s Aktau Port. He called for further actions to facilitate trade and greater efforts to integrate regional markets. Finally, Baimukhan pointed out that Kazakhstan is doing its utmost to become a global and significant player in developing transport corridors while strengthening partnerships worldwide.

Across-The-Board Accountability: The Cornerstone Of Pakistan’s Su...	Pakistan has long grappled with deep-rooted socio-economic and socio-political challenges along with elite capture that continue to stymie its progress. The nation faces persistent issues such as widespread poverty, high unemployment rates, and inadequate access to essential services like quality education and sustainable healthcare. The economic difficulties create a cycle of dependence and underdevelopment. Compounding these challenges, the political landscape remains fraught with instability. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former Prime Minister Imran Khan, has announced large-scale nationwide protests on November 24, 2024, with an indefinite sit-in at D-Chowk termed as 'Final Call'. The demonstrations are expected to intensify political tensions, with PTI leaders describing the event as pivotal in shaping the country’s future. This political strife occurs amidst accusations of state interference and opposition crackdowns, contributing to an uncertain governance environment. Simultaneously, Pakistan is witnessing a resurgence in terrorism. Recent attacks, such as the gun assault in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Kurram District that killed at least 42 civilians, underscore escalating security concerns. These incidents highlight vulnerabilities in border management and counterterrorism strategies, particularly in regions impacted by militant insurgencies. ​The interplay of economic hardship, political discord, social polarization, and rising insecurity exacerbates Pakistan’s challenges, hampering its prospects for survival. On the socio-political front, a legacy of political instability, inconsistent policy frameworks, and an entrenched culture of patronage and corruption further impede reforms. This complex web of socio-political woes undermines the country’s ability to build resilient institutions and maintain public trust, as efforts to enforce accountability often clash with vested interests and power structures resistant to change. Addressing these intertwined challenges requires a multi-faceted approach, where across-the-board accountability emerges as the linchpin of any sustainable solution. Corruption, weak institutions, and lack of accountability have long been one of the most significant impediments to Pakistan’s growth. It bleeds public funds, which could otherwise be directed toward essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The siphoning off of these critical resources exacerbates social inequality and erodes trust in public institutions. When corruption runs rampant, faith in the very systems meant to uphold justice and fairness is shattered. The result is a population that feels disenfranchised, fostering an environment where the rule of law holds little weight. Efforts like the establishment of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) have been undertaken to combat corruption, aiming to investigate and prosecute cases of financial malpractice. However, the outcomes have been mixed, with critics pointing out issues of selective accountability and political influence. To truly succeed, Pakistan must implement stringent anti-corruption measures and enforce transparent processes for government spending and policymaking. Strong institutions are the backbone of a sustainable society. In Pakistan, the strength of these institutions has often been compromised by undue influence and a lack of accountability. A clear example of this is the failure of police reform initiatives aimed at reducing political interference in law enforcement. Despite multiple attempts to create an independent and professional police force, reforms have often faltered due to a lack of sustained political will and accountability measures. The rule of law must prevail, and no individual regardless of rank should be above it. Ensuring that checks and balances exist across all branches of government is essential. It is only through such measures that public confidence in governance can be restored. Reforms in the judiciary and electoral systems must promote impartiality and transparency, reinforcing the idea that institutions are designed to serve the public interest, not individual power brokers. Economic stability is another critical aspect of national sustainability that thrives on accountability. Investor confidence is closely linked to a nation’s adherence to the rule of law and fairness. When businesses and investors are assured that regulations are consistently applied, and there is recourse for addressing grievances, they are more likely to commit to long-term investments. This inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) can bolster economic growth and create jobs, laying the groundwork for a more resilient economy. Conversely, when accountability is absent, the economy becomes susceptible to mismanagement and corruption. For instance, Pakistan’s external debt reached a staggering $130.4 billion in March 2024, debt-to-GDP ratio stood at approximately 65.7% as of September 2024, contributing to economic pressures that further exacerbated inflation and unemployment. Financial instability stemming from unchecked corruption and poor governance has repeatedly led to debt crises that hinder progress. Similarly, public trust and social cohesion are critical for the unity and collective growth of a country. Trust between the government and its citizens is built when people believe their leaders are accountable and that governance operates transparently. When this trust is established, it creates a social contract that encourages citizens to actively participate in nation-building and respect the laws that govern them. On the other hand, when leaders evade responsibility and misuse their power, the social fabric begins to unravel. Accountability mechanisms such as public access to information, citizen participation in policymaking, and open channels for dialogue empower people to play a role in governance. These measures foster a sense of shared responsibility that strengthens the country from within. Equally important is the effectiveness of public policies, which can only be achieved when there is proper oversight. Policies crafted and executed without mechanisms for accountability are prone to failure, inefficiency, and corruption. A notable example is the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), which, despite its aim to provide financial aid to the underprivileged, has faced issues of mismanagement and misuse of funds due to lack of stringent oversight. Today, Pakistan finds itself teetering on the edge of economic collapse, grappling with severe political turmoil, widespread lawlessness, and escalating social unrest. The nation’s systems are deeply mired in corruption and inefficiency, hindering effective governance and progress. To move forward, several steps need to be taken to embed accountability at every level of society. Legislative reforms must be introduced to mandate transparency in public services, ensuring that leaders are held accountable for their actions. Independent oversight bodies should be strengthened and granted the autonomy necessary to function without fear of political reprisal. Civic education must be prioritized so that citizens are aware of their rights and responsibilities and understand the importance of holding their leaders accountable. Additionally, leveraging technology to create digital platforms for transparency – where government actions, contracts, and expenditures are published – can significantly enhance public scrutiny and involvement. Across-the-board accountability, therefore, is not just a lofty ideal but an actionable necessity for Pakistan’s future. It ensures that resources are managed prudently, public trust is fortified, and sustainable development becomes a reality. For Pakistan, embedding accountability at every level from local councils to the highest offices of power – is the only path forward. By doing so, the nation can cultivate stability, prosperity, and progress that can endure for generations to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfw32v4NXMZjSM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-22T08:17:21-08:00	
Trump, AUKUS And Australia’s Dim Servitors – OpEd	There is something enormously satisfying about seeing those in the war racket worry that their assumptions on conflict have been upended. There they were, happily funding, planning and preparing to battle against threats imagined or otherwise, and there comes Donald Trump, malice and petulance combined, to pull the rug from under them again. What is fascinating about the return of Trump to the White House is that critics think his next round of potentially rowdy occupancy is going to encourage, rather than discourage war. Conflict may be the inadvertent consequence of any number of unilateral policies Trump might pursue, but they do not tally with his anti-war platform. Whatever can be said about his adolescent demagogic tendencies, a love of war is curiously absent from the complement. A tendency to predictable unpredictability, however, is. The whole assessment also utterly misunderstands the premise that the foolishly menacing trilateral alliance of AUKUS is, by its nature, a pact for the making of war. This agreement between Australia, the UK and the US can hardly be dignified as some peaceful, unprovocative enterprise fashioned to preserve security. To that end, President Joe Biden should shoulder a considerable amount of the blame for destabilising the region. But instead, we are getting some rather streaky commentary from the security wonks in Australia. Trump spells, in the pessimistic words of Nick Bisley from La Trobe University, 'uncertainty about just what direction the US will go'. His policies might, for instance, 'badly destabilise Asia' and imperil the AUKUS, specifically on the provision of nuclear-powered submarines to the Royal Australian Navy. On the last point, we can only hope. The Australians, being willing and unquestioning satellites of US power, have tried to pretend that a change of the guard in the White House will not doom the pact. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong expressed a 'great deal of confidence' that things would not change under the new administration, seeing as AUKUS enjoyed bipartisan support. Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, is also of the view that AUKUS will survive into the Trump administration as it 'strengthens all three countries’ ability to deter threats, and it grows the defence industrial base and creates jobs in all three countries'. Another former ambassador to Washington, Arthur Sinodinos, who also occupies the role of AUKUS forum co-chair, has pitched the viability of the trilateral pact in such a way as to make it more appealing to Trump. Without any trace of humour, he suggests that tech oligarch Elon Musk oversee matters if needed. 'If Musk can deliver AUKUS, we should put Musk in charge of AUKUS, and I’m not joking, if new thinking is needed to get this done,' advises the deluded Sinodinos. The reasoning offered on this is, to put it mildly, peculiar. As co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, it is hoped, will apply 'business principles' and 'new thinking'. If the Pentagon can 'reform supply chains, logistics, procurement rules, in a way that means there’s speed to market, we get minimum viable capability sooner, rather than later'. These doltish assessments from Sinodinos are blatantly ignorant of the fact the defence industry is never efficient. Nor do they detract from the key premise of the arrangements. Certainly, if an anti-China focus is what you are focusing on – and AUKUS, centrally and evidently, is an anti-China agreement pure and simple – there would be little reason for Trump to tinker with its central tenets. For one, he is hankering for an even deeper trade war with Beijing. Why not also harry the Chinese with a provocative instrument, daft as it is, that entails militarising Australia and garrisoning it for any future conflict that might arise? Whatever the case, AUKUS has always been contingent on the interests of one power. Congress has long signalled that US defence interests come first, including whether Australia should receive any Virginian class submarines to begin with. Trump would hardly disagree here. 'Trump’s decisions at each phase of AUKUS cooperation will be shaped by zero-sum balance sheets of US interest,' suggests Alice Nason of the University of Sydney’s US Studies Centre rather tritely. If Trump be so transactional, he has an excellent example of a country utterly willing to give everything to US security, thereby improving the deal from the side of Washington’s military-industrial complex. If there was one lingering, pathological complaint he had about Washington’s NATO allies, it was always that they were not doing enough to ease the burdens of US defence. They stalled on defence budgets; they quibbled on various targets on recruitment. This can hardly be said of Canberra. Australia’s government has abandoned all pretence of resistance, measure or judgment, outrageously willing to underwrite the US imperium in any of its needs in countering China, raiding the treasury of taxpayer funds to the tune of a figure that will, eventually, exceed A$368 billion. Rudd openly acknowledges that Australian money is directly 'investing into the US submarine industrial base to expand the capacity of their shipyards.' It would be silly to prevent this continuing windfall. It may well be that aspect that ends up convincing Trump that AUKUS is worth keeping. Why get rid of willing servitors of such dim tendency when they are so willing to please you with cash and compliments?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV8oUOrk3WyH_	2024-11-21T18:20:57-08:00	
Central Asian Countries Sending Migrant Workers To Asia Over Russ...	Since the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack in Moscow in March 2024, hostility among Russians toward Central Asian immigrants has increased dramatically (see EDM, March 26, 28). Despite the Kremlin’s need for such workers to compensate for Russia’s demographic decline, Russian officials have adopted increasingly harsh policies toward immigrants, expelling some, leading others to leave on their own, and causing many Central Asians to consider going home or at least working somewhere other than Russia (Window on Eurasia, July 18, 2022; see EDM, May 9, 15,October 22). Moscow’s decision to try to force migrant workers into its invasion force in Ukraine has further exacerbated these feelings (see EDM November 8, 2023, October 31). The Kremlin has tried to hide the extent of this exodus by ending the publication of interior ministry data on departures and publishing only data on arrivals, figures that distort how many have left. This has even led some commentators to claim that there has been no population decline in the Central Asian migrant community in Russia and blame the West for the situation (Federalcity.ru, October 25; Ritmeurasia.ru, November 16). Reports from across Russia show, however, that such claims are baseless (e.g., Infopro54.ru, November 20; Novosibirsk MK.ru, November 21; Tvernews.ru, November 25). This mass emigration has led to two policy shifts, one in Moscow and one in Central Asian capitals. In Moscow, the Russian government has sought to find replacements for the departed Central Asian migrant workers from elsewhere, turning to Zimbabwe and India, as well as to smaller countries in East Asia (Novopossiya, May 31; Versia.ru, October 10; see EDM, February 23, September 16, October 16; Tsargrad.tv, November 16). Appeals to these countries for migrant workers began even before the Crocus City Hall attack, but the recent intensification of Moscow’s efforts both highlights the significance of Central Asians’ departure and is fraught with danger for Russia (see EDM, February 6). On the one hand, migrant workers from these countries are far less likely to know Russian or be familiar with Russian norms than Central Asians whom the Soviet Union colonized and only in the past thirty years gained their independence with Russia continuing to influence their politics. The new migrant workers’ lack of cultural and linguistic knowledge seems certain to exacerbate ethnic tensions within the Russian Federation, even more radically in places where Central Asian workers’ absence of Russian language knowledge and sensitivity to Russian cultural norms have been significant causes of the current anti-migrant campaign. Turning away from the use of Central Asians as migrant workers will simultaneously undercut Moscow’s efforts to promote the revival and spread of the Russian language throughout Central Asia and is already reducing Moscow’s influence across the region. Policy changes in Central Asian countries point to this development, which may ultimately have even more profound consequences. Until recently, Central Asian governments welcomed the role that their migrant workers in the Russian Federation play in helping the economies of their countries stay afloat. Transfer payments from the migrant workers have played a key role in that regard, especially in Tajikistan, and in other countries as well. These governments view sending such people to Russia as a kind of safety valve because even if radicalized by their experiences in Russia, they will not come home soon and threaten the regimes (see EDM, October 5, 2023). Consequently, when it became apparent that more migrant workers were returning from the Russian Federation, these governments focused on expanding the list of other countries where their nationals could go instead, which would help stabilize their homelands and prevent them from coming back and sparking unrest. More than any other country in the region, Uzbekistan has been concerned about ensuring the continuation of sending its migrant workers abroad and is urged by experts to diversify the countries it sends people to (Window on Eurasia, June 24, 2021). Several years ago, under the rubric of promoting a balanced foreign policy, Tashkent sought to promote migration to countries other than Russia, including most prominently South Korea, where 100,000 of its citizens now work, becoming the largest diaspora community in that country (Gazeta.uz, February 5; MK.ru, July 17). At the end of October, taking its lead from Uzbekistan and fearing the consequences of losing remittances and the possible instability with migrant workers returning from Russia to Tajikistan, the poorest country in the region, Dushanbe signed an agreement with Seoul. This agreement paved the way for Tajiks to go to South Korea to learn Korean and work in Korean factories beginning in January 2025 (Ritmeurasia.ru, November 11; For background on the decision, see Window on Eurasia, April 3). The initial numbers may be small, as in the case of the Uzbeks, but will grow rapidly as it seems virtually certain that more Tajiks will return from Russia. This pattern will be repeated by other Central Asian countries as well, which, similarly to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, will seek to arrange for their nationals to go to other Pacific Rim countries. Moscow commentators now say that such a maneuver will cost Russia dearly, and China, Russia’s ally, will not save Russia in Central Asia. Instead, Beijing is likely to exploit this new set of Russian losses. Beijing itself, however, will also find itself in competition with South Korea and other Pacific Rim countries because, unlike them, it is unlikely to be able to arrange for the dispatch of Central Asian workers to China. Consequently, Versia analyst Ruslan Gorevoy says anti-Central Asian immigrant actions and moves may mean that Moscow has now 'lost' that region in much the way it has lost other regions of the former Soviet space (Versia.ru, April 15). Central Asian governments not only are denouncing Moscow for its anti-immigrant moves but are also supporting Ukraine and refusing to take part in many Russian-led activities—despite Moscow’s propagandistic efforts to claim the contrary (Krym.Realii, April 15; Kakaz-uzel.ru, April 12; Eurasia Today, April 16). Moscow officials have only themselves to blame, Gorevoy concludes, due to their approach toward the Crocus City Hall terrorist act. Moscow played to the nationalist, even racist, attitudes of many Russians rather than pursuing Russia’s national interests, which include using Central Asian workers and expanding Moscow’s influence over their homelands. Reversing course now will be difficult if not impossible, he suggests and notes that this is just one more way in which the mishandling of a manageable ethnic issue leads to geopolitical catastrophe (For a useful discussion of how Moscow is now struggling with this, see Russian Council on International Affairs, November 20).

Who Is Bo Guagua And Why Do China Watchers Care About His Wedding...	He has not been heard from for over 10 years, but the news of his engagement this month has made a splash from Taipei to (probably) Tiananmen. Bo Guagua, a once high-profile son of the Chinese political elite whose notorious family drama both shocked and shaped the country’s politics today, touched down in Taiwan last week to make a pilgrimage familiar to many young people: to visit his future in-laws. Yet the public attention on what should have been a normal rite of passage reveals just how much interest there is in this Communist Party scion once tipped for power. Taiwanese media quoted a nurse who laid eyes on him ('he is handsome!'), while the office of the former Taiwanese president declared that he had not been invited to the wedding, which is due to take place on Nov. 23. So who is Bo Guagua – and why is there interest in his marriage? A princeling ‘hongsandai’ Bo Kuangyi, better known as 'Guagua,' is the son of Bo Xilai, once one of the most powerful politicians in China, and his businesswoman wife, Gu Kailai. His grandfather, Bo Yibo, was one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party. Guagua was one of a generation of high-profile princelings whose family wealth – gained owing to a connection to the ruling party amid China’s rapid economic growth in the 1990s and 2000s – made them known as the 'hongsandai' or 'third generation reds.' From that privileged position, he led a visibly gilded lifestyle that included prime seats at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, a private education at Harrow, the English boarding school, and an enviable network of contacts collected from stints at Oxford and Harvard Universities. Unlike peers of similar backgrounds – top leader Xi Jinping’s daughter, for example, also attended Harvard but under a pseudonym – Guagua was not shy. He became known as a playboy, hosting parties with guests like Jackie Chan and allegedly driving a Ferrari to pick up the daughter of a diplomat (a story he later denied). All this came to a sudden, stunning end when the Bo family became the subjects of one of the most consequential scandals in modern Chinese politics— one that has shaped the contours of power in the country today. Who is Bo Xilai and why was he important? Before his dramatic downfall, Bo Xilai, Guagua’s father, held some of the most important positions in the CCP, putting him on a collision course with President Xi Jinping, who rose to the position in 2012, the year of Bo Xilai’s ousting. At the time, the elder Bo had been the CCP party secretary of Chongqing, the capital of Sichuan province. In that capacity, Bo amassed enormous influence as well as personal wealth. As secretary, he developed a political system that came to be known as the 'Chongqing model,' which featured sweeping crackdowns and an emphasis on promoting Maoist, 'red' culture. In early 2012, Bo and his wife Gu Kailai were implicated in a corruption scandal and, shockingly, the death of a British businessman and family friend, Neil Heywood, who Gu was later convicted of murdering. Bo and Gu are now both serving life sentences in prison in China. What happened to Bo Guagua after his parents went to jail? When his parents were facing criminal allegations in China, Bo Guagua was in graduate school at Harvard. He was reported to have been smuggled into hiding by U.S. officials in April 2012 as it was unknown whether he would also be swept up by authorities. Months later, in September, he posted a social media post defending his father shortly after the elder Bo was accused of major offenses, including bribery and shared responsibility for the Haywood murder. The elder Bo was found guilty of corruption in 2013 and stripped of his party membership the following year. His son then kept a low profile in the U.S., his whereabouts largely unknown except that he attended Columbia Law School after he finished at Harvard. Only last week did he re-emerge in public, when he arrived in Taiwan. Who is Bo Guagua’s fiancée? The bride-to-be has been named as Hsu Hui Yu, a Taiwanese woman who Guagua is said to have known for years after meeting as students. One of the details of what has caught the attention of China watchers is the political ties of the bride’s family. Hsu’s grandfather was a prominent political donor and member of the Kuomintang (KMT), while her uncle most recently ran as a party candidate for the legislature in 1992, before turning to run the family real estate and healthcare business. The family were close to the ex-KMT president Ma Yinjeou, whose government was once accused of helping them improperly secure business contracts. What does interest in the nuptials tell us? What might seem like a baroque scandal about a Chinese political insider is still capable of igniting the public imagination.. Slews of news stories have been written about the marriage already, with everything from commentary on whether the marriage of a CCP heir into Taiwan is a good thing to how the Mainland Affairs Council, the Taiwan agency that deals with China, is handling the situation. It also speaks to the mystery that surrounds the children of senior Chinese leaders, many of whom went abroad, have access to unknown deposits of wealth and influence, and will shape important relationships in the future. As for the couple, they have not publicly commented. They are expected to make their residence in Canada, where, according to a LinkedIn profile, Bo Guagua is now based. The wedding this weekend itself is supposed to be 'low key.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV7na3sLS5IiZ	2024-11-21T17:47:28-08:00	
Ukraine’s ‘IT Army’ Has Lessons For Taiwan – Analysis	Today Ukraine stands at the forefront of the world’s struggle for democracy and freedom, but tomorrow the front could be Taiwan. Preparations for war with China are currently underway, and Taiwan has been purchasing and stockpiling cutting-edge weaponry from the West to better resist a full-scale invasion. Taipei has also been watching Ukraine carefully and learning from its experience fighting a war against Russia. One oft-overlooked teachable moment has been Ukraine’s ability to mount an effective cyber defense, conducted by a distributed group of backers nicknamed the 'IT Army.' Taiwan should look to implement a similar framework and develop its own IT Army for if and when China invades. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine unleashed the first all-out cyber war between two nation-states. Early on, many feared that Ukraine would suffer a 'Digital Pearl Harbor' when faced with a full Russian onslaught, but that moment never came. Russian cyber-attacks fizzled out and Ukraine, with help from both public and private partnerships from the West, withstood Russia’s cyber offensive. In parallel, Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation spearheaded the effort to bootstrap an IT Army to ensure maximum resistance. Given the clear benefits of the strategy in Ukraine’s case, the lesson for Taiwan becomes clear: don’t wait until being attacked to bolster IT capacity; rather, take preemptive measures to build the force up during peacetime. The IT Army of Ukraine has contributed extensively to Ukraine’s cyber offensive against Russia, executing a diverse and effective range of attacks. These include leaking documents from Russia’s central bank, disrupting Internet services in territories occupied by Russia, incapacitating one of Moscow’s major Internet providers, and targetingprivate corporations to hinder economic activities. Such tactics would be helpful in supporting Taiwan’s efforts to defend itself from China. At its peak, the group boasted a membership of several hundred thousand. Yet a singular focus on followers can be misleading because the IT Army’s attacks have bene growing in effect and scale despite declining subscriber counts on associated Telegram channels. The primary tactic of the IT Army revolves around Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The approach is simple yet effective, involving the coordination of a large number of computers to launch a concerted attack on a specific network or website. By flooding the target with an overwhelming volume of requests, the system is overloaded and eventually crashes. According to its own assessments, the IT Army has inflicted economic losses on Russia estimated between $1 and $2 billion. Consequently, the cyber warfare conducted by the group represents a novel and innovative form of sanctions against their adversaries. Ted (which is a callsign), the spokesperson for the IT Army of Ukraine, shared that, 'economic exhaustion plays a decisive role in the outcome of conflicts, and cyber operations, including DDoS attacks and hacker interventions, are powerful tools in achieving this objective.' Such tactics, namely the infliction of ‘economic exhaustion,’ would be relevant in the context of Taiwan as well. The IT Army’s campaign against Russian Internet providers led to a disruption of 40% of their resources at one point, leading to extensive disruptions in service. The Russian news site Kommersant wrote that 'the number of DDoS attacks on Russian companies doubled year on year in the first quarter. Mostly companies from critical industries… Roskomnadzor speaks of repelling almost three times more attacks in the first quarter alone than in the entire 2023.' Furthermore, while Russia has invested billions of dollars in its building out its own satellite internet network, Ukraine’s IT Army launched an attack in April 2024, that took out 'two of the largest providers, Astra and Allegrosky' for several days. Building Up Taiwan’s IT Army Assembling a volunteer IT Army presents a significant challenge due to its inherently decentralized nature, where members rely more on their own skills than formal training. Fortunately, however, these skills have been developed by our increasingly digital world, opening the door to normal citizens participating in cyber warfare. In Ukraine’s case, the government has also stepped in to draft legislation that would establish a more-formal legal structure to the IT Army. Taiwan too, should consider moving forward with similar legislation to build a legal structure in preparation for future contingencies. For example, the Ukrainian legislation would open the door to foreign volunteers and potentially afford them legal protections for participating in hacking on Ukraine’s behalf. Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, an Associate Professor in Cybercrime and Cybersecurity at the University of Portsmouth believes that if the IT Army were incorporated into Ukraine’s cyber reserves, it could help offer legal protections for civilians participating in cyber war by offering 'legal protection as combatants, potentially shielding them from prosecution for their actions during the war.' Taiwan will also need to consider the legal framework for creation of its own cyber-warfare capabilities, both for its own citizens and for the worldwide volunteers who come to Taiwan’s defense. Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu has previously stated that the country is preparing for a potential war with China, which could come as early as 2027. If this timeframe is even remotely possible, Taiwan should immediately mobilize all available resources to prepare for this future conflict, as the importance of cyber warfare can only be expected to increase in the interim. China’s deep integration and reliance on technology will also make it more vulnerable to attacks from a volunteer IT army. In fact, successful cyber operations carried out by Taiwan could have the potential to inflict substantial economic and operational losses on China, thereby limiting some of China’s military power projection. Taiwan should actively apply the major lessons learned from Ukraine’s IT Army. For example, as Ukraine has developed a strategic blueprint to quickly mobilize its IT Army in times of war, Taiwan too should create a detailed plan for swiftly assembling its own digital defense force. Similarly, inspired by how Ukraine established secure communication channels to efficiently manage its cyber operations, Taiwan should also implement secure systems to coordinate its cyber army and target enemy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging the benefits of international collaboration, as seen in Ukraine’s IT Army, Taiwan should explore strategies for recruiting foreign volunteers, thus enhancing the global reach and capabilities of its own cyber forces. To facilitate the effort, Taiwan should preemptively draft legislation—mirroring Ukraine’s efforts to legally integrate its cyber volunteers—providing a formal structure that offers legal protections and defines the roles of participants within Taiwan’s cyber reserves. Taiwanese intelligence will also need to identify vulnerabilities, prepare botnets, and establish gateways well in advance to penetrate China’s digital systems quickly. This preparatory work is essential to ensure that, in the event of a conflict, Taiwan can quickly and efficiently target critical Chinese infrastructure and systems. Therefore, to ensure operations can be scaled to wage large-scale DDoS attacks and other cyberwarfare offensives, the Taiwanese government will need to reach as many people as possible who are willing to join the fight. This strategy will likely need to include creating educational materials that can be widely shared on social media to recruit younger individuals who are willing to educate themselves and partake in DDoS efforts. However, not all preparations will be technical. One limitation that Ukraine’s IT Army has faced is engaging with non-technical audiences. To scale the work of effective botnets and DDoS attacks, more people are needed to join the attacks. But the average civilian citizen does not consider themselves capable of conducting cyberattacks. The reality is that anyone can follow simple instructions to download a tool and allow their computer’s processing power and Internet access to be added to the botnet and help flood an enemy’s networks to bring them down in times of war. Ukraine’s IT Army has proved to be an effective fighting force against Russia in the cyber realm. As Taiwan prepares for a potential conflict with China, it must take all necessary steps to prepare itself not only for the physical battlefield but the digital one as well.

Indonesia: Prabowo Announces $600B Economic Growth Plan Despite E...	By Ami Afriatni Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is betting big on downstream industries to fuel his country’s economic future. Prabowo, who took office a month ago, has announced a bold target: $600 billion in investment to transform the country’s natural resources into high-value products. He calls it a cornerstone of his vision for 'Golden Indonesia 2045,' marking the country’s centennial. 'We invite foreign investors to come and participate,' Prabowo said during a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit in Lima, Peru, on Nov. 14. He outlined plans to develop 26 key commodities, spanning renewable energy, fisheries and mining, as part of Indonesia’s downstream industrialization strategy, known locally as hilirisasi. But as Prabowo courts international backers, analysts have raised concerns about the potential environmental and social impacts, regulatory consistency and challenges in sustaining local benefits. For Indonesia, downstreaming has become a buzzword for economic transformation in Southeast Asia’s largest country. By processing raw materials domestically – whether it’s refining nickel into ferronickel (an alloy of iron and nickel used to make stainless steel), or producing cosmetics using palm oil – the government hopes to reduce its reliance on commodity exports and strengthen its industrial base. The concept isn’t new. Under former President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Indonesia banned raw nickel exports in favor of smelting and refining, a move that increased revenues from U.S. $800 million in 2015 to over $4 billion by mid-2023, according to government data. Prabowo’s administration aims to replicate this success across other sectors. 'This level of investment is reasonable over five years,' Wijayanto Samirin, an economist at Paramadina University in Jakarta, told BenarNews, referring to Prabowo’s target. Still, Wijayanto urged the Prabowo administration to avoid repeating the missteps of its predecessor, which he said had resorted to 'excessive tax incentives.' 'To make downstreaming work, several aspects must be improved to ensure that it not only adds economic value, but also upholds environmental, social and governance principles,' Wijayanto said. He identified key areas for reform, including labor and environmental regulations, infrastructure and institutional frameworks. 'The habit of giving away too many tax breaks needs to stop,' Wijayanto said. 'We must ensure that the government receives a fair share of revenue from foreign and domestic investors.' Prabowo’s proposal comes with promises to improve Indonesia’s business climate, including legal reforms, favorable tax incentives and economic stability. 'I think private business wants a certainty of the legal system, private business wants a favorable economic climate, political climate, stability, security, and good conditions, favorable incentives, and these we are addressing,' Prabowo said at the APEC summit. 'We have liberalized our laws, we open the health sector for foreign health companies, we are opening our education sector, we invite foreign universities to open campuses, we are inviting foreign hospitals to open their branches in Indonesia. Indonesia, he declared, was 'open for more business.' 'I’m determined to protect all investments, to give favorable economic conditions, and to be involved in the major economic organizations of the world, and to work together with all of you to create mutual prosperity,' Prabowo said. Criticism But his perceived reliance on foreign capital has drawn criticism. 'Foreign investors often stop at producing intermediate goods,' said Tauhid Ahmad, an economist at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF). 'To go further – toward finished products – we need stronger participation from local investors.' One example of this tension lies in Indonesia’s nickel industry. While the push for downstreaming has boosted exports, the focus remains on semi-finished products including ferronickel, which limit broader economic benefits. Tauhid argued that sectors such as agriculture and fisheries, with high local potential, should take precedence in future downstream efforts. Environmental and sustainability challenges Critics also point to environmental concerns. Despite Indonesia’s pledge to embrace renewable energy, much of its industrialization effort continues to rely on coal-fired power plants. 'Downstreaming powered by coal undermines its own goals,' said Nailul Huda, an economist at the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS). 'If implemented with clean energy, downstreaming could boost economic growth by 1.5 times. But under the current model, it exacerbates environmental damage.' Environmentalists warn that overextraction of natural resources could deplete reserves, turning Indonesia into an importer of raw materials in the future. 'Downstreaming must align with resource sustainability,' said Mahawan Karuniasa, an environmental scientist at the University of Indonesia. 'Otherwise, we risk running out of resources while leaving environmental devastation behind.' Prabowo’s efforts to attract international support have seen some success. During visits to China and the United States after he took office on Oct. 20, Prabowo secured over $10 billion in investment commitments for renewable energy and mining projects. China, Indonesia’s second-largest foreign investor, has funneled $34.19 billion into the country since 2019, while American companies have expressed interest in geothermal energy and carbon capture technology. The stakes are high. Prabowo’s vision for Golden Indonesia 2045 aims for 8% annual economic growth, a figure that economists call ambitious. 'Even 5.5% to 6% growth would be commendable if it’s sustainable,' Wijayanto said. 'What matters is the quality of growth.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVyEdbDNTlv_q	2024-11-21T17:39:03-08:00	
Russian Orthodox Church Viewed As Tool To Spread Kremlin Influenc...	The Russian Orthodox Church is quietly winning allegiance from priests and parishes from the Patriarchate of Alexandria in Egypt with offers of humanitarian aid, vaccines, infrastructure, schools, hospitals and spiritual patronage. Experts say this is a geopolitical strategy meant to help the Kremlin spreads its influence on the continent amid an ongoing battle within the Orthodox Church over the war in Ukraine. 'Most analysts of Russia’s presence in Africa would miss this development,' Bob Wekesa, director of the African Center for the Study of the United States at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, told the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI). 'Because it is not the most publicized of Russia’s strategy in Africa.' Located in the Egyptian port city, the Patriarchate of Alexandria looks after the continent’s estimated 1 million Eastern Orthodox Christians. The Russian Orthodox Church has for centuries been one of the most powerful bodies in orthodoxy and commands power beyond most religious denominations. It is closely linked to the Russian state and functions as a de facto arm of the government. J. Peter Pham, an ordained Episcopal priest with a doctorate in theology and a postgraduate degree in canon law, recently visited African churches and spoke with clergy from diverse denominations. 'Whenever I traveled in these areas where I’d heard it was happening, I started looking into it. And it turns out it wasn’t just one or two isolated cases,' Pham, who has served as the United States special envoy for the Great Lakes Region and was the first-ever Sahel envoy, told Foreign Policy magazine. 'It was a large number of African Orthodox clergy who had been part of the Patriarchate in Alexandria and had been recruited by the Moscow Patriarchate,' Pham added. 'It was very systematic.' Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria has said that his clerics have been paid $200 each for joining the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2021, Russia established the Patriarchal Exarchate of Africa in response to requests from African Orthodox clergy after the Patriarch of Alexandria sided with the Orthodox Church in Ukraine after the Russian invasion. The Russian Orthodox Church also opened more than 200 parishes in 25 African countries between December 2021 and July 2023, according to a report from the Russian news agency Interfax. The Russian church’s expansion 'is becoming a key component of the Kremlin’s exercise of soft power in Africa, promoting many conservative and anti-Western positions,' Charles A. Ray, wrote for the FPRI. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow claims that the Patriarchy of Alexandria will lead the body of believers into the Western sphere of influence, according to a Politics Today report, while his agenda reinforces Russia’s ambitions in Africa and asserts that African nations can protect themselves from external pressures. Theodore II shuns any efforts to politicize the Orthodox faith. In 2023, he warned the Orthodox world of the danger of Moscow’s political ambitions in Africa. In an Orthodox Times report, he said Orthodox Africans are being 'spiritually poisoned by the Patriarchate of Moscow.' Ray argued in the FPRI report that the Russian Orthodox Church’s expansion in Africa cannot be looked at without considering its relationship to Russian state interests. The church is financially supported by Kremlin-backed entities. 'Its expansion, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, aims to challenge the existing Orthodox churches in Africa and to promote conservative, anti-Western alliances,' Ray wrote. 'It appears to be more about enhancing the Russian image and expanding state influence than religious conversion.' Wekesa said the Russian church faces an uphill task if it wants to convert Africans. 'I deduce that the Russian Orthodox (Church) will aim to capture a small elite tied to the top echelons of governments in pursuit of opaque Russian interests rather than winning large congregations,' he told the FPRI.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV-6NLuv7Kb5m	2024-11-21T17:36:53-08:00	
Hermes 2 Construction Permits Approved By US Nuclear Regulatory C...	The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has voted to issue construction permits to Kairos Power for the Hermes 2 Demonstration Plant. The permits will authorise Kairos to build a facility with two 35 MWt molten salt-cooled reactors that would also include a shared power generation system. Kairos' Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor became the first US Gen IV reactor to receive a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) construction permit in December 2023, and now Hermes 2 becomes the first electricity-producing Gen IV plant to be approved for construction in the USA, Kairos said. Hermes 2 is intended to provide operational data to support the development of a larger version for commercial electricity production. Kairos submitted its application to build Hermes 2 in July 2023, and the NRC issued its final safety evaluation for the permits in July this year, and the final environmental assessment for site in August. 'While keeping safety at the forefront, the permitting process was quite efficient, and we issued these permits in less than 18 months,' said NRC Chair Christopher Hanson 'This shows we can rapidly apply relevant conclusions from earlier reviews to promptly reach decisions on new reactors.' Following a new, streamlined mandatory hearing process conducted via written documents, the NRC said it has authorised the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation to issue the permits, having found the review by NRC staff of the Hermes 2 application 'adequate to make the necessary regulatory safety and environmental findings'. The permits are expected to be issued in the near future. 'The Commission's approval of the Hermes 2 construction permits marks an important step toward delivering clean electricity from advanced reactors to support decarbonisation,' Kairos CEO and co-founder Mike Laufer said. 'We are proud to lead the industry in advanced reactor licensing and look forward to continued collaboration with the NRC as we chart a path forward with future applications.' Hermes 2 plant will be built on land adjacent to the Hermes reactor, which is currently under construction. Kairos Power must apply for and obtain an operating licence from the NRC before the plant can start up.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV1JB1Dgb_-Yx	2024-11-21T17:35:20-08:00	
Wealth And Income Inequality Are Essential For Social Cooperation...	By Michael Njoku It is popularly deemed a sign of moral superiority and a mark of the 'progressive' mind to heavily criticize the existence of inequalities of wealth and income within the social order of the division of labor and private ownership in the means of production. However, the sober mind, careful of being unduly biased by errant ideological presuppositions, is often found to hold views that run contrary to the prevalent lines of reasoning advanced by these critics. This includes the validity of the teachings of economics, not on the basis of blind belief, but as an outcome of scrutinizing the logical chains of reasoning advanced and the necessity of certain conclusions, including the reality of the existence (and even benefit) of inequalities in a free-market, capitalist society. This article affirms an economic ground for differentials in wealth and income of individuals under a capitalist system of production. Additionally, it offers a defense of these differentials, as logically necessary outcomes of socio-biological inequalities among acting men within the social order of division of labor and private ownership in the means of production. Social Division of Labor As Means To Ends Classical economics recognizes that greater productivity is to be derived from the social division of labor relative to autarkic self-sufficiency. It also recognizes that labor—the human factor of production—is essentially defined by its variability and differences in capacities possessed by various individuals in society. In regard to this last fact, all that the economist can say is that inequality exists among individuals and that it is causally relevant to the emergence of subsequent differences in outcomes among acting men within a market economy. Mises puts it very clearly in Human Action as follows: Economists must never disregard in their reasoning the fact that the innate and acquired inequality of men differentiates their adjustment to the conditions of their environment. Thus, individuals with varying skills, personalities, and mental dispositions integrate themselves into the social division of labor in order to satisfy their most urgent wants better than they would under autarkic conditions. The Ricardian Law of Association explains the tendency of these individuals to intensify their voluntary cooperation in the social division of labor given the prospect of better want satisfaction. Origin of Differentials of Individual Wealth and Income in a Capitalist Society Each individual, in choosing his career or line of work, goes where the expected marginal value productivity of his labor is higher. This is achieved by means of the price system. For specific economic categories, such as the entrepreneur and capitalist, this is a risky venture implying the possibility of losses, since all actions aimed toward the future are necessarily uncertain. Furthermore, each participant in a given productive venture has claims to definite quantities of output by virtue of titles to definite quantities of input factors in the production process. Also, to the contributions of each participant is imputed a premium, which is graduated according to the height of value attached by the consumers to this contribution in the final product. The interplay of these facts explains the origin of inequalities of wealth and income in a market society. Thus, we can essentially boil down the origin of inequality of wealth and income in a capitalist system to the following factors: a) differentials in the physiological constitution and geography of acting men as evidenced in their various skills, competencies, and intelligence; b) better foresight and correct anticipation of the future state of the market by certain individuals relative to others; c) marginal value productivity of various input factors—implying that only the final consumers, by their evaluations, can judge whether one’s contribution to the final product is worthy of high remuneration or not. Consequent upon the above demonstrations, the Marxists’ claim that the entire output of production belongs to labor, as an economic category distinct from entrepreneurs, capitalists, and landowners, becomes grossly unfounded on the following grounds: First, labor is not the only input factor in the production process; it combines its powers with the natural powers stored up in the capital goods and resources previously accumulated by the capitalists and landowners, respectively. Second, the central entrepreneurial task of directing these factors of production to those lines that aim at satisfying the most urgent of the not-yet-satisfied needs of consumers, and the subsequent success of this task as evidenced by profits, would not have been made without the purposeful actions of the entrepreneur. Comparative Criteria of Justice Under Capitalism and Socialism Every socio-economic system implies a logically-prior ethical framework by which the actions of individuals are evaluated. With the prior sanction of this ethical system, it becomes established how future actions of men in society would be evaluated. Here, we shall look at the comparative criteria of justice under capitalism and socialism, respectively. The distributive justice of a capitalist system is tied to its peculiar ethic of private property. All property in a capitalist society—including inputs to productive ventures and proceeds from them—are clearly defined and can be traced to specific owners. Ownership title to property is gained through original appropriation of previously-unowned resources and contractual transfer of existing property titles from a previous owner to a new owner. Every man cooperating in the social division of labor is entitled to the products of his efforts in the production process. There is no room for arbitrariness under this distributive criterion. Only by not participating in production or by means of aggression and violence by the state can a man be denied his entitlements. The socialist distributive criteria, on the other hand, disconnect productivity from reward insofar as property relations between individuals and input factors are less defined, and given that all the input factors are 'collectively owned' by the socialist community with control of its allocations being vested in the hands of a designated caretaker. Under this state of affairs, income is assigned and calibrated according to the arbitrary value judgments of the planner as against the evaluations of the final consumer under capitalism. This includes the decision to enforce quantitatively-equal distribution of proceeds of production among participants in the social division of labor of the socialist community—regardless of differentials in skill and level of complexity of task. From the above, it follows that justice in a capitalist system is evaluated differently from justice in a socialist commonwealth. More particularly, the socialist conception of justice aims at the violent enforcement of egalitarianism and subjection of the able and competent producers in complete servitude of the less able and less competent. Misapplying the criteria of distribution of socialism to a capitalist system would have the effect of destroying the incentive structure that impels action under a capitalist system of production. When individuals can no longer tie the level of productivity to reward due to violent intervention, they become disincentivized to produce as they would in the absence of violent intervention. Thus, the ultimate outcome of this would be a fall in productivity. There is a critical error in discussions about wealth and income distribution and, consequently, justice under a capitalist system. This leads to a tendency to transfer the arbitrary distribution criteria of a centrally-planned economy to the private property criterion of a free-market economy. When people criticize the distributive justice of a capitalist system, all they merely imply is a substitution of the socialist distribution criteria for the existing state of affairs.

Khamenei’s Legacy For Iran: Poverty, Repression, And A Failing Ec...	Over the past half-century, Iran has experienced a devastating economy that has destroyed the homes and livelihoods of many of its people. Amid this, the crisis-inducing and perpetuating policies of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, as the successor to regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini, have been the primary drivers of the most destructive economic crises in the country. Suppression of progressive forces domestically and the export of terrorism and fundamentalism abroad have led to a horrifying spiral that has eradicated Iranians’ living conditions, productivity, and welfare. Despite the weakening of religious fascism in recent years, the resulting crises persist. Today, the Iranian people must either endure polluted air filled with heavy fuel oil and substandard gasoline, resigning themselves to a slow death, or suffer through exhausting blackouts. To afford a simple meal, such as an omelet, one must buy tomatoes priced at 700,000 rials per kilogram. Even state media have admitted the policy failures of the past fifty years. These policies have led to widespread poverty, technological decline, low-quality production, capital flight, rising unemployment, and inflation. On November 16, Jahan-e Sanat news website reported, 'There is serious contention within Iran’s ruling political institutions over which political ideology, faction, or economic approach has played the primary role in creating the storm-tossed economy… The reality is that various governments collectively cooked up the stew that is Iran’s economy, and there’s no escaping this narrative. Broadly speaking, one could argue that the heavy, enduring shadow of politics—especially Iran’s foreign policy—has been the main factor behind the current economic situation.' Seventeen Years of Investment Stagnation Recent studies by the Majlis Research Center reveal that since 2007, investment in Iran’s industrial sector has been declining, plunging the sector into a phase of investment stagnation. On November 5, the state-run Etemad newspaper wrote, 'Apart from negative events such as economic sanctions and the shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, an unfavorable business environment, inconsistent and unstable economic policies, increased government interference in industries, and similar factors have caused a 17-year recession in Iran’s industrial sector' (Etemad newspaper, November 5, 2024). The Cost of Denial, Concealment, and Refusal to Face Reality Investment stagnation is just one example, while the energy imbalance crisis, now widely discussed, has been denied for years. Policies of denial and concealing shortcomings inevitably lead to failure. On November 12, the state-run Setareh Sobh newspaper wrote,' If there had been room for open media and free criticism, labeled as ‘blackening,’ we wouldn’t be here. Escalating crises in many environmental areas, sinkholes and land subsidence, exaggerated claims of self-sufficiency in food products, and disregarding expert opinions… have brought us to a point we wish we had never reached.' The Crossroad of Misery or Warmongering Recently, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, Abdolnaser Hemmati, said that the average economic growth over the past thirty years has not exceeded 3%, with much of this illusory growth dependent on the sale of the country’s oil resources, imposing high inflation on Iran’s impoverished population. On November 5, Basirat news website wrote, 'All expert assessments predict continued low economic growth and high inflation in our country this year and next. From the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which in their latest reports forecast 3% to 3.5% growth and 29% to 32% inflation for the current and upcoming years, to the Majlis Research Center, which predicts 2.5% to 2.8% growth and 34% to 31% inflation for the years 2024 and 2025.' The news of capital flight (approximately $16 billion in the past two to three years), smuggling (about $31 billion), and corruption (ranking 149th out of 180 countries) is repetitive. On November 5, the state-run Shargh newspaper wrote, 'We are now in an extremely critical situation where risky decisions not only lead to the failure of economic policies and development goals but also painfully impact the frail and weakened body of a society in which one-third lives below the absolute poverty line, and the middle class is evaporating. Capital flights are horrifying. And… a fundamental question arises: Are the first and foremost duties of governance to provide welfare and comfort for the people and advance the country’s development, or not? The choice lies between reducing poverty and increasing social wealth or adhering to specific ideological ideas and aspirations.' It is evident that the regime’s response is nothing but increased poverty, misery, and repression of millions of people, along with the plundering of the nation’s resources and assets for warmongering and exporting terrorism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVxXImImev-nK	2024-11-21T17:29:20-08:00	
Pentagon Confirms Russia Launched New IRBM Missile At Dnipro, US ...	By C. Todd Lopez The Russians launched Thursday a new kind of missile at Ukraine, what the Defense Department is calling an 'intermediate-range ballistic missile,' or IRBM, said the deputy Pentagon press secretary. 'I can confirm that Russia did launch an experimental intermediate range ballistic missile,' said Sabrina Singh during a briefing today at the Pentagon. 'This IRBM was based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile model. In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was prenotified, briefly, before the launch, through nuclear risk reduction channels.' The IRBM missile was launched at the city of Dnipro. While Singh said the missile carried a conventional warhead, she also said it's possible the missile could be fitted with other warheads as well. 'It could be refitted to certainly carry different types of ... conventional or nuclear warheads,' she said. The Defense Department has characterized the IRBM as 'experimental' in that it's the first time a weapon of its kind has been used on the battlefield in Ukraine, Singh said. 'This was a new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield,' she said. 'That's certainly [of] concern to us ... I don't have an assessment of its impacts right now, but it's something that, of course, we're concerned by.' Singh also said an IRBM and an intercontinental ballistic missile have similar flight paths, high trajectories and can carry large payloads. 'But the main difference lies in the range and the strategic purpose,' she said. Also, this week, the Defense Department confirmed that the United States would provide to Ukraine antipersonnel landmines. Yesterday in Laos, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III explained why the U.S. would provide antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine and how what the U.S. would provide is different than the landmines the Ukrainians are currently producing for themselves. 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting they've kind of changed their tactics a bit and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore,' Austin said. 'They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close in and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces.' In the face of that changing tactic, Austin said, the Ukrainians have been manufacturing their own landmines to slow down Russian advances. 'They're fabricating their own antipersonnel landmines right now,' he said. 'The landmines that we would look to provide them would be landmines that are not persistent. You know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate. And that makes it, you know, far more safe eventually than the things that they are creating on their own.' Singh told reporters that the Ukrainians have assured the U.S. that the landmines, when they arrive, will be used only inside Ukrainian space. 'Absolutely they have committed that they're going to use these mines in their own territory,' she said. 'I should have added that they're not going to use them in populated areas.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVx-Jwg1rdqYt	2024-11-21T17:27:27-08:00	
US Court Indictment Of Indian Billionaire Adani And Impact On Ind...	Gautam Adani had allegedly used US investors' money for bribing Indian officials to get big contracts in the solar energy sector Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who rules over a multinational business empire worth tens of billions of dollars, is now facing an arrest warrant from a New York court. According to Reuters, prosecutors are planning to hand the arrest warrants to foreign law enforcement. If executed, the warrant will leave an indelible black mark on his reputation as India's top-most businessman with the greatest influence on India's powerful Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Wednesday, a grand jury in New York indicted Gautam Adani and seven others on charges of bribing Indian officials to the tune of US$ 265 million to get US$ 2 billion worth of contracts in the booming Indian solar energy sector. The bribe money had been collected and paid by perpetrating a fraud on US investors, the indictment alleges. Lisa H Miller, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Criminal Division, accused Adani of conspiring to obtain lucrative supply contracts 'through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors'. US Court Charges A federal court in Brooklyn saw a five-count criminal indictment, charging Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vneet S. Jaain, executives of Adani Green Energy (AGE) with conspiracies to commit substantive securities fraud. They played key roles in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to obtain funds from US investors and global financial institutions by giving false and misleading statements. The indictment also charges Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of a renewable-energy company with securities that had traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2023 and also Cyril Cabanes, Saurabh Agarwal and Deepak Malhotra, former employees of a Canadian institutional investor, with conspiracy to violate the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with Adani's bribery scheme. Indian Officials Bribed The indictment alleged that Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vneet S. Jaain lied about their 'bribery scheme' as they sought to raise capital from US and international investors. The indictment alleges schemes to pay over US$ 250 million in bribes to Indian government officials, to lie to investors and banks to raise billions of dollars, and to obstruct justice. 'The Criminal Division will continue to aggressively prosecute corrupt, deceptive, and obstructive conduct that violates US law, no matter where in the world it occurs,' the filing said. Getting Solar Contract Between 2020 and 2024, the defendants agreed to pay more than US$ 250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to obtain lucrative solar energy supply contracts which were projected to generate more than US$ 2 billion in profits after tax over an approximately 20-year period. On several occasion, Gautam S. Adani personally met with an Indian government official to advance the 'bribery scheme' and the defendants held in-person meetings with each other to discuss aspects of its execution, court filings said. The defendants frequently discussed their efforts in furtherance of the bribery scheme, including through an electronic messaging application. The defendants extensively documented their corrupt efforts. Sagar R. Adani used his cellular phone to track specific details of the bribes offered and promised to government officials. Vneet S. Jaain used his cellular phone to photograph a document summarizing various bribe amounts the US partner owed the Indian Energy Company for its respective portion of the bribes. And Rupesh Agarwal prepared and distributed to other defendants multiple analyses using PowerPoint and Excel that summarized various options for paying and concealing bribe payments and deleting incriminating messages. There are documents allegedly showing conversations and other material records that show money raised from US investors was allegedly used to bribe government officials in India. Power Pacts Signed According to the court filings, following the promise of bribes to Indian government officials, between July 2021 and February 2022, electricity distribution boards in the States or Union Territories of Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh entered into Power Sale Agreements (PSAs) with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a federal Indian government owned enterprise. Andhra Pradesh's electricity distribution companies entered into a PSA with SECI on or about December 1, 2021, pursuant to which the state agreed to purchase approximately seven gigawatts of solar power- by far the largest amount of any Indian state or region. The allegation is that a large chunk of the bribe was directed at officials in Andhra Pradesh. Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, who were working for Azure Power (an Indian company which was also listed in the New York Stock Exchange between 2016 and 2023) joined Adani's bribery scheme, to convince state power distribution organizations to buy power from SECI. Why Is US Concerned? It is alleged that Azure Power and the Adanis concealed the bribery scheme from US banks and investors from whom they raised billions for the solar energy project. 'Adani Green Energy tried to raise money from US and international investors with a 2021 bond offering on the basis of false and misleading statements about the firm's anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts,' The New York Times reported. The non-disclosure and bribing, serious charges, lie at the heart of the US federal probe and indictment. NYT reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 'filed a parallel civil case saying that Adani Green Energy raised more than 175 million USD from US investors'. The report adds that one of Adani's associates was charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). That law makes bribing foreign officials a crime for companies operating in the US. The FCPA, established in 1977 after a series of corporate scandals, makes it illegal to offer, pay, or promise anything of value to foreign officials to gain business advantage. Therefore, even though the allegations of bribery might have taken place in Indian states, American authorities started investigations because the case involved American entities and investors. In Adani's case, following the indictment, the trial will likely move to the 'arraignment' stage. The judge will communicate the charges and decide whether to grant bail to the accused persons. The accused can decide whether to plead guilty or not guilty in response to the charges. If they plead not guilty, the case will proceed to a 'jury' trial. Impact on India and Indo-US Relations The Adani group has trashed the allegations as baseless and added that it will take to all legal means to prove it. But the Congress party which has been accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being in cahoots with Adani for mutual benefit, has called for Adani's immediate arrest. While Modi and the government itself are silent, BJP leader Sambit Patra said that the law could take its course. Experts say that the case will definitely harm the reputation of the Adani group in the Indian and international market especially among foreign investors who will take a dim view of corporate governance in India. Shares of Adani Group companies tanked up to 20% on the Bombay Stock Exchange in Thursday's intra-day trade after Gautam Adani, was charged by US prosecutors. The Adani company, Adani Green, has called off the issue of US dollar denominated bonds worth US$ 600 million. If the case proceeds badly for Adani, it will further damage his position in India. But as Wilson Centre South Asia expert Michael Kugelman says. it will be difficult for Indian business and State institutions to disentangle themselves from Adani as he is heavily present in the infrastructure and energy sectors, which also happen to be Prime Minister Modi's favourite sectors. As for India-US relations, Kugelman points out that US President-elect Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi have a symbiotic relationship and some of Trump's key appointees are pro-India, like Marco Rubio (Secretary of State), Michael Waltz (National Security Advisor) and Tulsi Gabbard (National Intelligence Chief). They are China hawks too. And for any US administration, India is key to resisting China's ambitions in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Pro-Modi elements in India say that the US Administration under Trump might cover up the damage caused by the Adani affair and get on with the job of maintaining cordial political, economic and defence ties, keeping the looming threat from China in mind.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV5ksEsZ2uwv0	2024-11-21T17:15:38-08:00	
Trump’s Opportunity To Reset US-Iran Relations – Analysis	Donald Trump is back and so is the 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran to 'drastically throttle' Iran's oil sales to kill Tehran’s nuclear program and its ability to fund regional proxies. But Trump aide Brian Hook who ran the anti-Iran campaign in Trump’s first term claimed Trump has 'no interest in regime change.' That may be true but Iran, and everyone else, probably doesn’t believe it. The Trump 47 officials may soon learn that 2025 is not 2018 and, while Iran was on the ropes as Trump’s first term ended, things are different now. To start, open-handed American support for Israel’s campaigns against the Palestinian and Lebanese people has eroded support for U.S. moves by Middle East governments that might normally favor limits on Iran’s behavior. Saudi Arab’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), declared Israel was committing 'genocide' in Gaza. By using the G-word, MbS has made it hard for his government to walk back his remarks or reverse course absent a cease fire and implementation of something like the Arab Peace Initiative (which has been gathering dust since 2002 and may need a reboot). MbS also warned Israel against attacking Iran. Arab-Sunni Saudi Arabia and Persian-Shia Iran have been drawing closer since 2023 they agreed to resume ties after seven years of tensions. That the deal was brokered by China is a sign the regional powers had little confidence in a U.S. role, possibly suspecting it is in Washington’s (and Jerusalem’s) interest to keep the countries of the region divided. The countries’ military chiefs recently held defense talks, and planned a joint military exercisein the Red Sea (that probably won’t be interrupted by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.) In the civil realm, the countries are moving toward increased economic ties. The presidents of the United Arab Emirates and Iran held their first face-to-face talks in October, and UAE – Iran trade is on the upswing, and the Saudi crown prince (and de facto ruler) recently spoke to Iran’s new president. Qatar (which shares a natural gas field with Iran) and Iran are trying to broaden their economic ties that are largely based on hydrocarbons, and Iran supported Qatar during the Saudi-led 2017-2021 attempt to isolate Doha for allegedly supporting terrorism, though criticism of Riyadh by Doha-based Al Jazeera and friendship with Iran are the likely reasons. After a recent exchange of fire by Israel and Iran, Iran warned its neighbors not to attack Iran or to help the Israelis, and the Gulf Cooperation Council promptly declared, 'Our focus has been on de-escalation.' The Gulf states are dubious about 'maximum pressure' and are concerned it will upend warming relations with Iran and increase regional tensions. Middle Eastern governments are sensitive to public anger over American support for Israel’s killing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon, so will avoid any display of support for a U.S. campaign that may target Arab or Muslim peoples. The countries that signed up for the Abraham Accords may soon look pretty foolish, so when MbS accused Israel of 'genocide' in Gaza he was demonstrating Saudi Arabia's distaste for the U.S. line, unlike the UAE which has increased daily airline flights to Israel. Also wary of a renewed U.S.-Israeli campaign against Iran and the Central Asian republics. The republics are growing their trade ties to Iran, a market of 90 million people, and the host of seaports at Bandar Abbas and Chabahar, essential for Central Asia trade with Asia and Africa. Iran also hosts the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-kilometer multi-modal transport corridor that connects India to Europe, and is Plan B if a transport route through Afghanistan and Pakistan is not reliable. Iran has been actively working to strengthen its relations with Central Asian countries as part of its Look East strategy which has seen increased relations with China, Russia, and to offset the effect of Western sanctions. Iran's Foreign Minister has engaged in discussions with his counterparts in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the other republics and the newly-elected president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, has met the presidents of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. In Central Asia. Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan have all increased trade links with Iran, in Tajikistan’s case to include a defense pact. The republics don’t want to sacrifice the opportunity in Iran, a country with a consumer market projected to grow 11% by 2030. Iran's focus on Central Asia includes improving trade ties, developing infrastructure projects, and increasing connectivity through transportation networks. For example, Iran has proposed linking the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project to its own network, which would provide Central Asian countries with access to the Persian Gulf and beyond. And the oil market has changed since 2018. According to Argus Media, Iran’s oil exports, which were below 500,000 b/d through the second half of 2019 and 2020 due to Trump-era sanctions, began increasing in 2021 and have increased every year since: 'Exports averaged around 1.6mn b/d in January-October [in 2024].' If the U.S. again sanctions Iran, it may find it hard going as the remaining buyers may be 'those who do not necessarily fear sanctions.' Iran has built out its network to bypass sanctions, and has expanded its tanker fleet, though the clandestine effort is not without substantial costs, such as Chinese customers demanding a substantial discount, and the cost of rebranding the oil to disguise its origin. Iran has an oil export terminal on the Gulf of Oman, which was inaugurated in July 2021, and can export 1 million barrels per day of oil. The facility cannot replace Iran’s main export terminal at Kharg, which can handle 8 million barrels per day, but it allows Iran to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic chokepoint and will require the Americans to try to cover two terminals instead of just the main facility at Kharg if Washington decides to attack Iran The U.S. may try to interdict Iran’s oil exports to China, but what will China’s response be if it considers the interdiction an act of piracy? Beijing may decide to provide a naval escort for the oil shipments or may reflag the vessels as Chinese, upping the ante for the Americans. If the Peoples’ Liberation Army Navy, the world’s largest navy with newer vessels than the U.S. Navy, deploys to escort the tankers it will refine its 'blue water' operating skills. The increased operating tempo will also stress the U.S. fleet which for the second time in a year has no aircraft carrier in the Middle East. A recent U.S. Navy report noted on the material readiness of Navy ships: 'several functional areas and subsystems remained degraded or showed declining trends' since 2017, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office noted in 2021 the Navy needed to improve its limited capacity for battle damage repair, in the event the U.S. and any foe come to blows. And if the U.S. seizes a China-bound cargo, then what? The ship will have to be anchored somewhere, the cargo will possibly be offloaded and stored, the crew will need to be housed and fed, consular support will need to be provided, and someone will have to guard the vessel. China is the biggest trading partner for every country between the Persian Gulf and the South China Sea, so the U.S. may be unable to find volunteers for these low-return chores. The U.S. ignored the warning of former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski who said the U.S. should avoid actions that would create 'a grand coalition of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran, an 'antihegemonic' coalition.' The U.S. has masterfully created that coalition by expanding NATO, ignoring the One China Policy, and sponsoring the 1953 coup in Iran that has freighted the Iranian people with more and more authoritarian rulers. But the ascension of new presidents in Tehran and Washington may be an opportunity to start rebuilding relations. After his election in July 2024, President Masoud Pezeshkian announced his program in 'My Message to the New World' and declared his intent to strengthen relations with Iran’s neighbors, specifically mentioning Iraq, Türkiye, and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. He emphasized the need for a 'strong region,' said he hoped for 'constructive dialogue' with Europe, criticized the U.S. for exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and urged Washington 'come to terms with reality.' In October, President-elect Trump declared, 'I would like to see Iran be very successful. The only thing is, they can't have a nuclear weapon.' In 2023, then-Senator JD Vance said that Republican senators who wanted at attack Iran were 'living in the past.' In 2024, Republican Vice-President candidate JD Vance said, 'And our interest very much is in not going to war with Iran. It would be a huge distraction of resources. It would be massively expensive to our country,' Those are hopeful signs of a desire to reach a negotiated solution, but can the U.S. abide by any deal once the ink is dry? Neither Russia, China, nor Iran believe the U.S. will abide by the spirit and letter of any agreement as it has a record of bailing out of any commitments when it is convenient, to wit, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty NATO expansion ('not one inch eastward') Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Paris Agreement (Paris Climate Accord) Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Minsk agreements Open Skies Treaty Algiers Accord One China Policy U.S. intervention in Iran started with the 1953 coup. The U.S. then supported Iraq during 1980-1988 war after the U.S. and Iran agreed on the Algiers Accords (January 1981) where the U.S. pledged, 'it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene, directly or indirectly, politically or militarily, in Iran's internal affairs,' but this did not stop the U.S. from backing Iraq when the war starting to go in Iran’s favor in 1982. The U.S. killed General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq when he was carrying a message to Saudi Arabia in an effort to defuse tensions between Tehran and Riyadh. Many Iranians and Saudis probably think Soleimani was killed because he was working to reduce tensions in the region, which they think only benefits the U.S. and Israel. Then there is the killing of civilian Iranian scientists involved in nuclear power research. No one has taken the credit, but the Iranians no doubt believe it was the Americans or the Israelis with American connivance. Last is the STUXNET virus, a joint U.S.-Israel effort to attack break Iranian nuclear centrifuge equipment which 'leaked' and infected computers worldwide. The Chair of the NATO Military Committee recently admitted the only reason NATO troops are not is Ukraine fighting Russian troops is because Russia has nuclear weapons, which no doubt confirmed the views of Iranians who think the country should have nuclear weapons. Then there is the cautionary tale of Libya’s surrender of its nuclear program, and the mystery of why North Korea, one of the poorest and most isolated countries in the world, has not been attacked by the U.S. Iran’s relations with Russia and China have strengthened which adds to the country’s resilience. China and Iran signed a 25-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement in March 2021. This agreement aims to enhance bilateral relations and includes significant investments from China in Iran's economy. China plans to invest $400 billion in Iran's oil, gas, petrochemicals, transportation, and manufacturing sectors. In return, China will receive a steady and heavily-discounted supply of Iranian oil. The agreement allows China to deploy security personnel to protect its projects in Iran. The investments will also go towards upgrading Iran's infrastructure, and the agreement supports China's One Belt One Road Initiative, by enhancing connectivity and trade routes. Russia has supplied Iran with Su-35 fighter jets, Mi-28 attack helicopters, Yak-130 pilot training aircraft; Iran has sent Russia drones, and ballistic missiles. Non-military trade is also increasing. The Moscow Times reports, 'Russian exports to Iran rose 27% last year, and Russian imports from Iran increased 10%. Both sides have agreed to scale up trade in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, while Russia has pledged to invest an unprecedented $40 billion in Iran’s oil and gas sector.' The Times also notes, 'Perhaps the most important changes, however, have been in transport networks. As a result of the fighting in Ukraine, and in a bid to bypass Western sanctions, Russia has begun shifting trade routes southward. This is why Iran and Russia have ramped up work to develop the much-touted and ambitious International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which will stretch from the Persian Gulf to the Baltic Sea.' Despite its economic problems, Iran has increased its military budget, no doubt anticipating attacks by America or Israel. At the same time Iran has signaled it is willing to negotiate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but not 'under pressure.' Iran’s foreign ministerAbbas Araqchi clarified that when he told state television, ''There is still an opportunity for diplomacy, although this opportunity is not much. It is a limited opportunity.' A recent IAEA report notes Iran has begun implementing measures 'aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile [of near bomb-grade uranium]' though the IAEA also noted that Iran increased its inventory of 60% enriched uranium by 60% since the last report in August 2024. Iran's President Pezeshkian has indicated he is open to U.S. engagement: ''Whether we like it or not, we will face the United States in regional and international arenas, and it's better that we manage this arena ourselves.' And opinion leaders in Iran are saying their government should engage with Trump, with Shargh, the reformist daily newspaper editorializing that President Pezeshkian, must 'avoid past mistakes and assume a pragmatic and multidimensional policy,' though others are skeptical anything will change under Trump. Even the Quds Force commander, General Qassem Soleimani, once mused: 'maybe it’s time to rethink our relationship with the Americans,' though in the end it didn’t do him much good. All that said, 'maximum pressure' is a slogan, not a strategy. If Iran says 'Yes,' will Washington finally produce a coherent, executable strategy for its future dealings with Iran? Up to now its only strategy has been 'more sanctions,' hoping some liberals will miraculously appear and (democratically) seize power when in fact the Revolutionary Guard may take over and finally dispense with Vilayat-e Faqih. Whatever strategy Washington produces will be overshadowed by the disastrous retreat from Afghanistan in 2021, so the U.S. should favor a policy that increases regional connectivity and economic growth rather than carrying water for Israel or satisfying its desire to avenge the humiliation of 1979. Iran won’t surrender its hard-won nuclear expertise and has increased cooperation with the IAEA, but will it ever dash to the bomb? Israel claims it destroyed key Iranian nuclear fabrication facilities but the head of the IAEA said of the attack, 'as far as the IAEA is concerned, we do not see this as a nuclear facility.' Trump will not want to start a war with Iran over its nuclear program as he will be sensitive to the impact on the U.S. economy, so sanctions (and the occasional Israeli attack) will be all he has left. If that is the case, and Iran’s economy and oil export scheme is resilient enough, and Russia and China remain constant, we may be looking at years of low-level 'endless wars' to the joy of the Iran hawks in Washington. And there is a deadline of sorts for negotiations with Iran: 18 October 2025 sees the end of the JCPOA snapback mechanism, the last opportunity for world powers to initiate the snapback mechanism, returning all the sanctions that were lifted in the JCPOA agreement…' If the U.S. rejoins any sort of nuclear deal, it will have to be a new deal as Iran blew past the JCPOA 1.0 conditions after the U.S. abandoned the agreement. If the Americans want to expand a 2.0 deal to include ballistic missiles or Iran’s foreign policy, Iran may suggest similar limits on other countries in the region, and then demand that 2.0 be a treaty to bound future U.S. action, and to exploit differences in the U.S. on what is a 'good deal' that will be all too evident once the Senate takes up the treaty for ratification. So far, each side has demonstrated a lack of empathy for the other, the result of years of successful propagandizing, leaving each feeling more sinned against than sinning. And the hard-liners in each capital believe in the other’s perfidy, see conflict as key to their continued influence, and reap economic rewards from the status quo. On the U.S. side, Washington has never explained to American citizens its role in the 1953 coup that stifled Iran’s economic and political development, though Secretary of State Madeleine Albright admitted the U.S. role in overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953 and called the coup 'a setback for Iran’s political development.' To many Americans, the 1979 revolution and the hostage crisis appeared out of thin air. The U.S. needs to think long-term. Iran’s mullahs won’t rule forever and Americas association with economic hardship and violence won’t benefit it in the future. The U.S. should adopt a parallel effort to President Pezeshkian’s 'strong region' plan to emphasize trade and connectivity which will help the region make up the gains sacrificed in the 'lost decades' of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan. Despite all the talk about what Trump might do, Biden is still the U.S. president until 11:59 on 20 January 2025. If both sides stick to what is feasible, keep their emotions and hard-liners in check, and Iran offers Trump a deal that he feels only he could have made, we may see stability and more economic opportunity for the region’s youth and the start of the banishment of the legacies of 1953 and 1979.

Bulgaria’s Pro-Russian Parties Display Increasingly Open Ties Wit...	By Krassen Nikolov (EurActiv) -- After the radical Vazrazhdane party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (PES) has become the second pro-Russian formation in the Bulgarian parliament to openly display its contacts with the Kremlin, with both parties having a total of 57 seats in Bulgaria’s 240-seat parliament. BSP-United Left MP Ivan Petkov travelled to Sochi on 17 November to participate in the first forum dedicated to 'building a relationship between BRICS countries and European countries'. The Bulgarian MP also met with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who regularly threatens the US and EU countries with Russian nuclear strikes over their support for Ukraine. 'All the representatives from Europe had a separate meeting with the former president and prime minister of Russia, who is currently the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev. At the meeting, the problems that European countries have were discussed, as well as the opportunities for cooperation in the near future, both with Russia and with the BRICS countries,' the MP added. He claims that the meeting with Medvedev at the Sirius Olympic Village near Sochi was attended by 'a large number of representatives from the parliaments of Germany, Slovakia, Italy, Serbia, Greece, the Czech Republic, France, England, as well as many members of the European Parliament'. Euractiv asked the Bulgarian Socialist Party for information about Petkov's visit to Russia, but it did not receive a response. 'The forum provided an opportunity not only for a general discussion but also for private conversations between the delegations of the individual countries. I am the only participant from Bulgaria,' said Petkov. The forum in Sochi was dedicated to the topics 'BRICS and Europe in the context of large-scale geopolitical restructuring' and 'The role of BRICS and European countries in building a fairer and mutually beneficial world economic order'. A few days before the Sochi visit, Petkov also organised a public meeting with Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova at a BSP club in Bulgaria's second-largest city, Plovdiv. 'No matter how hard our current international partners try, they will not be able to destroy our centuries-old traditions, and the Bulgarian people will continue to support the Russian Federation as their brother,' said Petkov during the meeting in Plovdiv. The BSP is one of the parties in the Bulgarian parliament with which the centre-right GERB party of former prime minister Boyko Borissov (EPP) held a meeting to explore the possibility of forming a governing majority. Earlier this week, the Bulgarian counter-intelligence service (SANS) received a tip-off that the closed Russian consulate in Varna was illegally operating out of the city's BSP centre. The Bulgarian Socialists are the second parliamentary formation to establish relations with the Kremlin this year. In August, the pro-Russian radical party Vazrazhdane sent its delegation to a BRICS forum in Moscow, personally led by party leader Kostadin Kostadinov. Before the European elections, a delegation from Vazrazhdane attended a conference of Putin's United Russia party. After the visit, it was announced that the party would become part of the far-right ID group in the European Parliament. With the ID group splintering into several groups in the new European Parliament, Vazrazhdane decided to join the AfD-led Sovereignists group.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tVxD7IEgXczxi	2024-11-21T17:09:46-08:00	
Biden Leaves Office But Risks War With Russia – OpEd	Democrats are in a collective state of panic because Donald Trump is returning to the presidency. But Joe Biden is escalating conflict in the Ukraine proxy war against Russia and endangering the whole world in the process. If Trump is a fascist, then surely Biden is as well. While every Donald Trump utterance is given great attention and dissected for proof of nefarious intent, dangerous actions taken by Joe Biden are minimized or go unreported altogether. The corporate media have never investigated the likelihood that Biden and his foreign policy team sabotaged the NordStream pipelines in 2022 in order to cut European allies’ connection to the Russian gas they depended upon. Two years went by before the New York Times reported that Turkiye hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine which might have ended the proxy war before thousands of lives were lost. Even as the Times reported that talks had taken place, the 'paper of record' neglected to mention that the Biden administration and the former prime minister of the UK, Boris Johnson , scuttled the talks and kept a dangerous conflict in place. It is important to remember these and other failures to adequately report Biden administration actions which have very serious consequences. Biden will be president of the United States only until January 20, 2025. Yet with less than nine weeks remaining in his presidency, he has chosen to escalate tensions with Russia in an effort to continue his failed policies and also to prevent Trump from changing them. On November 17, 2024, the corporate media began to report a serious change in policy which the Biden administration suddenly instructed them to cover. Biden decided to give Ukraine permission to use the U.S. Army Tactical Mission System (ATACMS) and send missiles into Russian territory. ATACMS requires U.S. staffing and technical expertise, which puts the U.S. and all NATO nations in direct conflict with the Russian government. President Vladimir Putin already said that such an action crosses a 'red line' and is an act of war. In response to Biden’s decision, Putin changed the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. The new doctrine states, 'Aggression from any non-nuclear state, but with the involvement or backing of a nuclear state, will be considered a joint attack on Russia.' While the not-yet-president Trump is routinely labeled as deranged and a danger to the nation and to the world, the current president is behaving very irresponsibly and risking conflict with another nuclear power. It is not just anti-imperialists and peace activists who oppose this rash act. The Department of Defense, the Pentagon, opposed the administration's neo-conservatives who recommended allowing Ukraine to attack inside Russia. On September 13, 2024, the prime minister of the UK, Keir Starmer, met with Biden at the urging of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is the administration leader in advocating for escalation. Starmer wanted to use British-made Storm Shadow missiles to strike inside Russia. Biden didn’t make the call at that moment but obviously, the subject was not far from his mind. While the Pentagon gave a thumbs down to the plan, others in the administration never gave up hope that they could carry out an escalation that was unlikely to change the course of the war. They added a dose of war propaganda to their misguided efforts in order to make the case for endangering the rest of the world. Suddenly reports appeared claiming that up to 10,000 troops from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly referred to as North Korea, are stationed in Russia and are assisting in the war effort. While there are countless images of the war in Ukraine, no one has managed to produce a photograph or any video footage of thousands of Koreans. It strains credulity that such a presence could be kept secret or would not be documented in one of the most documented conflicts in modern history. In the end, it is the neocons who usually win in this and other administrations. It is unlikely they had to do very much convincing to Biden, who as Barack Obama’s vice president was in charge of the policy which used Ukraine to counter Russia. The 2014 coup against Ukraine’s elected president and the subsequent sabotaging of the Minsk I and Minsk II agreements all led to the current moment. In 2022 Ukraine baited the Russians by attacking the Donbas and daring them to leave that region unprotected after years of provocations and many civilian deaths. Donald Trump has indicated that he would change U.S. policy towards Ukraine, although he also led the republicans to approve $61 billion in funding for this war effort in April of this year. Biden is tenacious in his maniacal determination and remains obsessed with his Ukraine project and with Vladimir Putin. He leaves office with a last gasp, a throw of the dice to force Trump’s hand and give him a war that he would be unlikely to end. No members of the Senate or House of Representatives have raised their voices to sound the alarm about Biden’s disregard for their prerogatives and for the safety of the nation. The corporate media continue to act like scribes and refuse to provide the analysis that is needed to adequately cover this important story. While liberals stay in a constant state of panic about Trump’s appointments and about what he might do as president, the current president has brought the nation to the brink because of what will ultimately be a futile effort to crush Russia’s sovereignty. As we enter a new phase of Trump derangement syndrome, it is important to know that he should not be treated as some sort of exception in the pantheon of presidents. The doctrine of Full Spectrum Dominance prevails no matter who is president of the United States. Bill Clinton bombed Yugoslavia, George W. Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, Barack Obama destroyed Libya, Donald Trump attempted regime change in Venezuela and Iran, and Joe Biden is determined to continue a bloody proxy war in Ukraine, even as he commits himself to genocide in a gruesome partnership with Israel. The U.S. has entered a new and very dangerous phase of its attempt to dominate the world because of Joe Biden’s unhinged determination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV4E55-lr2y1y	2024-11-21T17:08:17-08:00	
Russia’s Use Of Advanced Missile Sends Signal To West – Analysis	By Myroslava Gongadze Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia's use of a fast, powerful new missile to attack the city of Dnipro on Thursday, calling it a 'nuclear adventure' and a stark escalation in the war. The attack has ignited fears of a dangerous new phase in the war. In a nationwide address, Russian President Vladimir Putin later confirmed the use of a medium-range ballistic missile in the strike. Zelenskyy pointed to the strike as a sign of Moscow’s broader strategy, stating, 'It is obvious that Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground for weapons that threaten the world.' His remarks underscored the growing alarm in Kyiv over the deployment of advanced Russian missile systems against civilian targets. In his address, Putin framed the use of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile as a routine test within the conflict. 'The Russian Federation tested a medium-range ballistic missile, known as Oreshnik, during its operation in Ukraine,' he said. While he offered few technical details, analysts said the use of the missile and Putin’s acknowledgment appears intended to showcase Russia’s military capabilities to NATO and the United States. Putin’s announcement marks the first time Russia has openly acknowledged using such a missile during the war. In Washington, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the missile used was based on Russia's RS 26 rubes intercontinental ballistic missile model.' In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was pre notified briefly before the launch through Nuclear Risk Reduction channels,' she said. Strategic escalation Valeriy Chaly, Ukraine’s former ambassador to the U.S., described the attack as a 'new stage' in Russia’s aggression. Speaking to VOA, he emphasized that the strike was not just a challenge to Ukraine but also to its Western allies. 'This isn’t just about Ukraine,' Chaly said. 'It’s a challenge to the European security system and the United States. Moscow is signaling its readiness to escalate dramatically to influence the West.' He said that the response to the attack 'must be clear, united, and decisive — anything less risks emboldening Russia and jeopardizing global security.' Western leaders quickly condemned the strike. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled it 'reckless and dangerous,' while EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano described it as a 'qualitative escalation' in Russia’s tactics. Dnipro attack The missile targeted industrial facilities in Dnipro, injuring two people and causing significant damage. Ukrainian officials initially suggested the use of an ICBM, or intercontinental ballistic missile, citing the weapon’s speed and trajectory. Some analysts, including those in the U.S., believed it was more likely a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile, consistent with Putin’s confirmation. Dnipro residents, accustomed to regular air-raid sirens and missile attacks, reported that this strike felt uniquely different. Oleksiy Poltorazky, a local resident, recounted: 'We’ve learned to recognize the sounds of different missile types. This one was different — it hit almost immediately after the siren. Many here believe it was a ballistic missile because there was no usual warning sound.' The speed and power of the strike left many shaken. Poltorazky, however, remained resolute. 'There’s no panic, no apocalypse as everyone says. We have to live through this, raise our kids, protect our families and work. We have to fight and do everything possible for our country,' he told VOA. George Barros, an expert on the Russia team at the Institute for the Study of War, told VOA that Ukrainians should try not to overreact to the attack. 'It seems that the Russians targeted the city with an R-26 IRBM,' Barros said, referring to a Soviet-era intermediate-range missile. 'The main thing is to not panic. There's no reason to think that Putin’s likelihood to use a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction is any higher than at other points in the war. 'This is not the first time that Russia has used nuclear-capable weapon systems against Ukraine,' he said. 'Russia regularly uses Iskander nuclear-capable weapons, and this appears to be a signaling effort designed to deter further Western support for Ukraine.' Strategic ambiguity While Putin confirmed the missile test, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova provided limited details about the strike. Zakharova was reportedly instructed not to address the attack at all during a Thursday press conference. The calculated reticence deepens global unease, as Moscow oscillates between overt warnings and veiled threats, said some analysts, suggesting the ambiguity is part of a broader strategy to keep Western nations uncertain about Russia’s next moves.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV_f6SFsl4cye	2024-11-21T17:02:32-08:00	
Fallacies And Frames: The Theoretical Roots Of Logical Fallacies ...	The Frankfurt School, a prominent intellectual movement originating from the Institute for Social Research in Germany, offers profound insights into power, domination, and emancipation that continue to resonate in the study of International Relations (IR). Rooted in Marxist critique and critical theory, this school of thought challenges traditional paradigms, emphasizing the intersection of ideology, culture, and power in understanding global politics. Thinkers such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, and Jürgen Habermas significantly contributed to shaping this intellectual tradition, which has profoundly influenced critical IR theory. At its core, the Frankfurt School sought to critique and transcend the limitations of orthodox Marxism. Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment underscored how Enlightenment rationality, once a tool of liberation, had morphed into an instrument of domination under modern capitalism. This critique finds parallels in IR, particularly in the analysis of global structures that perpetuate inequality and hegemony. By challenging the neutrality of power structures, the Frankfurt School paved the way for examining how international institutions, economic systems, and cultural hegemonies sustain domination on a global scale. Herbert Marcuse, another leading figure, extended this critique by exploring the role of technological rationality in reinforcing domination. His work, particularly One-Dimensional Man, critiques the ways in which advanced industrial societies stifle dissent and perpetuate conformity. In IR, this perspective sheds light on how technological advancements and global institutions are co-opted to maintain existing power hierarchies. Marcuse's emphasis on the potential for resistance and alternative futures aligns with the critical theory's emancipatory aspirations, inspiring scholars to envision a more just international order. Walter Benjamin, though less directly associated with IR, offers valuable insights through his analysis of history and culture. In his Theses on the Philosophy of History, Benjamin critiques the triumphalist narratives of progress, emphasizing the need to recover marginalized voices and histories. This perspective has profound implications for IR, particularly in postcolonial studies and critiques of Eurocentrism. By interrogating the dominant narratives that underpin international relations, Benjamin's ideas encourage a reevaluation of the global order through the lens of historical justice and cultural plurality. Jürgen Habermas, a second-generation Frankfurt School thinker, bridges the critical theory of his predecessors with contemporary debates in IR. His theory of communicative action emphasizes the role of dialogue and consensus in overcoming domination. In IR, Habermas's ideas have influenced deliberative democracy and global governance theories, advocating for inclusive and participatory frameworks in international institutions. His work highlights the potential for rational discourse to mediate conflicts and foster cooperation, offering a normative vision for global politics. The Frankfurt School's critique of ideology is particularly relevant to IR. Antonio Gramsci's concept of cultural hegemony, though not directly part of the Frankfurt School, aligns with its emphasis on the role of culture in sustaining power structures. Critical theorists in IR have drawn on these ideas to analyze how dominant ideologies shape international norms, policies, and institutions. For example, the neoliberal economic order, often presented as natural and inevitable, can be deconstructed through the lens of critical theory to reveal its ideological underpinnings and inequitable consequences. The school's emphasis on emancipation also resonates in IR. Critical theorists such as Robert W. Cox have explicitly linked the Frankfurt School's insights to the study of global politics. Cox's distinction between problem-solving and critical theories underscores the need to question the underlying power structures that shape international relations. By challenging the status quo, critical theory opens possibilities for transformative change, advocating for an IR that prioritizes human emancipation over state-centric power politics. Moreover, the Frankfurt School's focus on the interconnection of economy and culture provides a robust framework for analyzing globalization. Globalization, often celebrated as a force for economic integration and cultural exchange, can also perpetuate exploitation and homogenization. Critical theory interrogates the capitalist logic underpinning globalization, exposing its role in exacerbating inequality and eroding local cultures. This critique extends to the international financial institutions, trade regimes, and transnational corporations that shape the global economic order, offering a counter-narrative to neoliberal triumphalism. The environmental crisis presents another arena where the Frankfurt School's ideas are increasingly relevant. Marcuse's critique of technological rationality anticipates many of the challenges posed by environmental degradation. His call for a more harmonious relationship between humanity and nature aligns with contemporary ecological movements that challenge the exploitative logic of global capitalism. In IR, critical theorists have built on these insights to advocate for sustainable and equitable approaches to global environmental governance, highlighting the intersection of ecological and social justice. The Frankfurt School's legacy in IR is also evident in its engagement with identity and resistance. Adorno's concept of the negative dialectic emphasizes the importance of resisting totalizing frameworks and embracing difference. This perspective has influenced critical approaches to identity politics in IR, particularly in feminist and postcolonial studies. By foregrounding the voices of marginalized groups, these approaches challenge the dominant narratives that perpetuate exclusion and inequality in the global arena. In contemporary IR, the Frankfurt School's influence is evident in the rise of critical theory as a distinct paradigm. Scholars such as Andrew Linklater and Richard Ashley have drawn on its insights to challenge mainstream IR theories, advocating for a more inclusive and normative approach to global politics. Linklater's work, for example, explores the potential for cosmopolitan ethics and global citizenship to transcend the limitations of state-centric paradigms. Similarly, Ashley's critique of realism and neoliberalism highlights the role of critical theory in exposing the ideological assumptions underlying dominant IR frameworks. Despite its contributions, the Frankfurt School's relevance to IR has been critiqued on several grounds. Its abstract and often pessimistic tone has led some to question its applicability to concrete policy issues. Moreover, its Eurocentric focus has been criticized for overlooking the diversity of perspectives in the global South. Nevertheless, the Frankfurt School's emphasis on power, ideology, and emancipation continues to inspire critical scholarship in IR, encouraging a more reflective and inclusive approach to global politics. The Frankfurt School's critical theory offers a powerful lens for understanding and challenging the complexities of international relations. Through the works of thinkers like Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Benjamin, and Habermas, it provides a framework for interrogating the ideological, cultural, and structural dimensions of global politics. By emphasizing emancipation and resistance, it encourages scholars and practitioners to envision alternative futures that prioritize justice and equity. As the global order faces unprecedented challenges, from environmental crises to rising authoritarianism, the Frankfurt School's insights remain as relevant as ever, offering a beacon for transformative change in international relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV1pYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-21T16:59:35-08:00	
ICC Issues Warrants For Israel’s Netanyahu, Gallant, Hamas Milita...	(RFE/RL) -- The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Muhammad Deif, a military commander in the Iran-backed group Hamas, alleging they committed crimes against humanity in the ongoing Gaza war. All three are accused of committing war crimes connected to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, an EU- and U.S-designated terrorist organization that is part of Tehran's network of proxies in the Middle East, and Israel's subsequent military intervention in the Gaza Strip. Iran's backing of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-supported militant group and political party that controls much of the southern part of Israel's neighbor, Lebanon, has sparked fears that the war in the Gaza Strip will engulf the Middle East. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the European Union blacklists its armed wing but not its political party. Hezbollah’s political party has seats in the Lebanese parliament. The court said the warrants had been classified as 'secret' to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of the investigations.Israel, which claims it killed Deif in July, blasted the move as 'a dark moment for the ICC.' Hamas, which has never officially acknowledged Deif's death, called the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant an 'important step toward justice.' The ICC said it had issued the arrest warrant for Deif as the prosecutor had not been able to determine whether he was dead. His warrant shows charges of mass killings during the October 7 attack on Israel that left some 1,200 dead, as well as charges of rape and the taking of around 240 hostages in the attack. 'The Chamber considered that there are reasonable grounds to believe that both [Israeli] individuals intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity, from at least 8 October 2023 to 20 May 2024,' the ICC said in a statement. 'This finding is based on the role of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant in impeding humanitarian aid in violation of international humanitarian law and their failure to facilitate relief by all means at its disposal,' it said.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called the move against Netanyahu and Gallant 'absurd' in a post on X, saying it was an attack of Israel's right to self-defense.'A dark moment for the ICC in The Hague, in which it lost all legitimacy for its existence and activity,' Sa'ar said. Tehran has yet to comment publicly on the warrants. Neither the United States nor Israel have recognized the ICC's jurisdiction. A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson said Washington 'fundamentally rejects' the issuance of the arrest warrants and 'the troubling process errors that led to this decision. Meanwhile, the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a post on X that ICC decisions 'are binding on all states party to the Rome Statute, which includes all EU Member States.' The court said Israel's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction was not required. However, the court itself has no law enforcement levers to enforce warrants and relies on cooperation from its member states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcf6fuNKx2tV5p-cVEvAVVq	2024-11-21T16:57:49-08:00	
Hezbollah Causing The Destruction Of Itself And Lebanon – OpEd	By Khaled Abou Zahr It is undeniable that Hezbollah is being hit and destroyed like never before. It hit Israel with extreme violence at the beginning of the Gaza war to try and extract gains. This message of violence has been answered by Israel in multiples and it is now inflicting a total reckoning on Hezbollah. This has also come at the price of the destruction of Lebanon and Lebanese lives. Hezbollah, through its actions, has brought chaos to Lebanon, just like in 2006. Yet, this time, while Israel refuses any mediation (and why would Tel Aviv accept it?), opposition groups in Lebanon have become much more vocal than in the past. They are now clearly and openly accusing Hezbollah of being responsible for this destruction. It has, through another reckless and unilateral decision of war, brought even more despair to Lebanon. It is clear now that Hezbollah, despite its declarations, is unable to cope with Israel’s superior capabilities. The question of the timing of the exploding pager operation —which, we must remember, even injured the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon — has now been answered. Yet, the main question is what Hezbollah will do in the face of this mounting external and internal pressure. The answer is the same as in the past: violence against the Lebanese. Whenever Hezbollah or the Syrian regime — its predecessor as occupier of Lebanon — were pressured externally, they chose to assassinate Lebanese. We are now back to the UN Security Council Resolution 1559 scenario of extreme pressure, which led to the waves of assassinations we all remember. And so, because it is weakened and unable to match Israel militarily, Hezbollah will go after the Lebanese voices of freedom. On top of the horrors of death of the current war due to this group’s unilateral decision, it will also add the death of its critics and opponents. The momentum for these actions has already been set in the same way as in the past. A clear indicator is an increase in the number of accusations of treason against journalists and truly free voices, mainly through social media for now. Once again, lists are circulating. While in the past they were spread via rumors and taxi drivers, now these lists circulate openly on social media and WhatsApp. This season of threats has even added video clips of the filthiest kind, created by artificial intelligence, to dehumanize its critics. It is the signature of this group and a sign of its level of despair. The pressure of potential defeat has not only contributed to the destruction of Hezbollah’s infrastructure, but also its image of might and strength. Despite the destruction the Lebanese are enduring, they are still seeing hope and a potential end to this never-ending cycle of violence. They are now clearly articulating the way out, which is by openly requesting for Hezbollah to surrender its weapons to the Lebanese Armed Forces. In response, the group is accusing the Lebanese opposition of seeking to use the Israelis to strengthen their position against it. This increase in blaming Hezbollah for the situation and the growing defiance, along with the demand to an end of its special status, is something the armed militia will look to quell with brutal force. It will look to do so before the end of the war, despite what its internet influencers are stating. Hezbollah knows, just like the Syrian regime did in the past, that its violence against the Lebanese will kill two birds with one stone. The first is to reestablish deterrence, not toward Tel Aviv but the voices of freedom in Lebanon, and the second is to add pressure to the international mediation efforts to stop the war. Unsurprisingly, these are the methods of an occupying force. And we also need to remind people that, in October 2023, the only occupying force was Hezbollah. I am indeed rehashing myself when I state that Israel was no longer occupying Lebanon following its unilateral withdrawal in 2000. There was hence no reason for Lebanon’s involvement. Everyone is heartbroken and despairing when seeing the destruction taking place today. Yet, the Lebanese pundits that do not condemn, first and foremost, the action that led to this expected Israeli reaction are and will always be accomplices in the violence that Hezbollah inflicted yesterday and will inflict tomorrow and every day on the free Lebanese. They are accomplices in the violence against journalists we have already witnessed, which is nothing but a trial balloon for what is to come. We are now in Hezbollah’s intimidation phase. Despite the war, it must be denounced and vehemently opposed to stop the next phase of possible assassinations. Moreover, if people do not stand up for Lebanon now, they will live under the rubble and foreign domination in this never-ending cycle. We are also noticing a tentative effort by Hezbollah to break the opposition by accusing some of treason and threatening them, while praising others for standing with the refugees from the south. These are futile methods that everyone should be aware of and reject. Hezbollah is now demonizing its critics in the worst possible way. The same methodology was used before assassinating former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Gebran Tueni, Samir Kassir, George Hawi, Pierre Gemayel, Walid Eido, Antoine Ghanem, Francois Al-Hajj, Mohammed Chatah and Lokman Slim. The same volatile situation and pressure on Hezbollah exist today as during the waves of assassination of the past. Hezbollah has caused, just like in 2006 and for absolutely no reason, the destruction of Lebanon. As it faces a close to existential threat of annihilation and is unable to answer the Israelis, it will fight the Lebanese who are honorable and courageous enough to demand the surrender of its military arsenal. This time, the voices of freedom need to win. Khaled Abou Zahr is the founder of SpaceQuest Ventures, a space-focused investment platform.

NASA: Mystery Of Life’s Handedness Deepens	The mystery of why life uses molecules with specific orientations has deepened with a NASA-funded discovery that RNA — a key molecule thought to have potentially held the instructions for life before DNA emerged — can favor making the building blocks of proteins in either the left-hand or the right-hand orientation. Resolving this mystery could provide clues to the origin of life. The findings appear in research recently published in Nature Communications. Proteins are the workhorse molecules of life, used in everything from structures like hair to enzymes (catalysts that speed up or regulate chemical reactions). Just as the 26 letters of the alphabet are arranged in limitless combinations to make words, life uses 20 different amino acid building blocks in a huge variety of arrangements to make millions of different proteins. Some amino acid molecules can be built in two ways, such that mirror-image versions exist, like your hands, and life uses the left-handed variety of these amino acids. Although life based on right-handed amino acids would presumably work fine, the two mirror images are rarely mixed in biology, a characteristic of life called homochirality. It is a mystery to scientists why life chose the left-handed variety over the right-handed one. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that holds the instructions for building and running a living organism. However, DNA is complex and specialized; it 'subcontracts' the work of reading the instructions to RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules and building proteins to ribosome molecules. DNA’s specialization and complexity lead scientists to think that something simpler should have preceded it billions of years ago during the early evolution of life. A leading candidate for this is RNA, which can both store genetic information and build proteins. The hypothesis that RNA may have preceded DNA is called the 'RNA world' hypothesis. If the RNA world proposition is correct, then perhaps something about RNA caused it to favor building left-handed proteins over right-handed ones. However, the new work did not support this idea, deepening the mystery of why life went with left-handed proteins. The experiment tested RNA molecules that act like enzymes to build proteins, called ribozymes. 'The experiment demonstrated that ribozymes can favor either left- or right-handed amino acids, indicating that RNA worlds, in general, would not necessarily have a strong bias for the form of amino acids we observe in biology now,' said Irene Chen, of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Samueli School of Engineering, corresponding author of the Nature Communications paper. In the experiment, the researchers simulated what could have been early-Earth conditions of the RNA world. They incubated a solution containing ribozymes and amino acid precursors to see the relative percentages of the right-handed and left-handed amino acid, phenylalanine, that it would help produce. They tested 15 different ribozyme combinations and found that ribozymes can favor either left-handed or right-handed amino acids. This suggested that RNA did not initially have a predisposed chemical bias for one form of amino acids. This lack of preference challenges the notion that early life was predisposed to select left-handed-amino acids, which dominate in modern proteins. 'The findings suggest that life’s eventual homochirality might not be a result of chemical determinism but could have emerged through later evolutionary pressures,' said co-author Alberto Vázquez-Salazar, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar and member of Chen’s research group. Earth’s prebiotic history lies beyond the oldest part of the fossil record, which has been erased by plate tectonics, the slow churning of Earth’s crust. During that time, the planet was likely bombarded by asteroids, which may have delivered some of life’s building blocks, such as amino acids. In parallel to chemical experiments, other origin-of-life researchers have been looking at molecular evidence from meteorites and asteroids. 'Understanding the chemical properties of life helps us know what to look for in our search for life across the solar system,' said co-author Jason Dworkin, senior scientist for astrobiology at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and director of Goddard’s Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory. Dworkin is the project scientist on NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which extracted samples from the asteroid Bennu and delivered them to Earth last year for further study. 'We are analyzing OSIRIS-REx samples for the chirality (handedness) of individual amino acids, and in the future, samples from Mars will also be tested in laboratories for evidence of life including ribozymes and proteins,' said Dworkin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lTFYJ05qC5UZ	2024-11-21T15:20:08-08:00	
What Are The Effects Of Historic Lithium Mining On Water Quality?	Lithium ore and mining waste from a historic lithium mine located west of Charlotte, North Carolina, are unlikely to contaminate surrounding waters with common pollutants such as arsenic and lead, according to a new study. However, high levels of other metals — namely, lithium, rubidium and cesium — do occur in waters associated with the mine. The new findings, from Avner Vengosh, distinguished professor of environmental quality at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, shed light on potential water quality impacts of legacy, or historic, lithium mining. They also provide baseline data for future studies exploring how reopening lithium mines in the N.C. piedmont will likely affect the water quality of drinking water resources nearby. 'The world is increasingly relying on lithium for the green-energy transition, but previous studies on the environmental effects of hard-rock lithium mining show mixed results,' Vengosh said. 'This study provides new, important data to clarify the possible environmental impacts. The area where the Kings Mountain Mine is located was once the largest lithium-producing region in the world. Situated in wooded, rural terrain of the piedmont, the mine opened in the 1950s and was abandoned in the 1980s, when more accessible lithium deposits drew prospectors to South America. The lithium at Kings Mountain primarily exists in granite-like rock called pegmatite, bound to a green-tinged mineral called spodumene. For their study, the researchers collected samples of pegmatite and waste rocks from in and around the mine, as well as samples of tailings — crushed rocks left over from historic spodumene extraction. They also sampled groundwater from the mine and surface water from Kings Creek, which flows from the mine. Samples from various piedmont streams provided baseline data on water quality. The researchers pulverized rock samples and mixed them in a solution designed to test how various contaminants might enter the surrounding environment. These laboratory experiments simulate how contaminants in the rocks would leach out under natural conditions. The researchers then analyzed the solutions, as well as the surface water and groundwater samples, for a wide range of metals commonly used to evaluate water quality. The study was published online in the journal Science of the Total Environment. Leaching experiments and water samples analyzed in the study showed common regulated contaminants — including arsenic, lead, copper and nickel — at levels below drinking water and ecological standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 'The fact that we don’t see these toxic contaminants was, in some way, a relief, because it suggests that future lithium exploration in North Carolina would not cause major negative water quality effects with respect to these elements,' Vengosh said. However, the team found high levels of other metals in the mine site relative to their concentrations in the piedmont water resources. 'We detected elevated concentrations of lithium, which was expected, but also found rubidium and cesium at levels you normally don’t see in natural waters, and that are not federally regulated,' said first author Gordon Williams, a Ph.D. student in Vengosh’s lab and the Division of Earth and Climate Sciences. 'An outstanding question, then, is how these elements affect human and environmental health.' Leaching experiments and evidence from water samples also indicated that the legacy lithium mine does not contribute to environmentally harmful acidic runoff commonly associated with other mining operations, like coal mining. Rather, interactions between the ore and waste rock samples and water led to temporary alkaline, or basic, conditions. The study did not address the effects of active lithium mining and processing on water quality, the authors emphasized. 'Excavating and crushing ore is just one aspect of lithium mining. Processing — which requires a chemical treatment to separate lithium from spodumene — may include additional chemicals that could potentially affect water quality,' Williams said. 'When lithium mining ramps up again in this area, processing could have impacts on local water resources that we didn’t measure,' he cautioned. The researchers are now extending their study by assessing drinking water quality across a band of lithium-rich geological terrain in the piedmont. By sampling private wells and surface water, they can better understand the potential impacts of lithium mining on water quality in North Carolina. The study was funded by the Duke University Climate Research Innovation Seed Program (CRISP) and the Albemarle Corporation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lUNufprwgocM	2024-11-21T15:18:04-08:00	
Fewer Than 7% Of Global Hotspots For Whale-Ship Collisions Have P...	According to the fossil record, cetaceans — whales, dolphins and their relatives — evolved from four-legged land mammals that returned to the oceans beginning some 50 million years ago. Today, their descendants are threatened by a different land-based mammal that has also returned to the sea: humans. Thousands of whales are injured or killed each year after being struck by ships, particularly the large container vessels that ferry 80% of the world’s traded goods across the oceans. Collisions are the leading cause of death worldwide for large whale species. Yet global data on ship strikes of whales are hard to come by — impeding efforts to protect vulnerable whale species. A new study led by the University of Washington has for the first time quantified the risk for whale-ship collisions worldwide for four geographically widespread ocean giants that are threatened by shipping: blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales. In the paper, published online in Science, researchers report that global shipping traffic overlaps with about 92% of these whale species’ ranges. 'This translates to ships traveling thousands of times the distance to the moon and back within these species’ ranges each and every year, and this problem is only projected to increase as global trade grows in the coming decades,' said senior author Briana Abrahms, a UW assistant professor of biology and researcher with the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Whale-ship collisions have typically only been studied at a local or regional level — like off the east and west coasts of the continental U.S., and patterns of risk remain unknown for large areas,' said lead author Anna Nisi, a UW postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. 'Our study is an attempt to fill those knowledge gaps and understand the risk of ship strikes on a global level. It’s important to understand where these collisions are likely to occur because there are some really simple interventions that can substantially reduce collision risk.' The team found that only about 7% of areas at highest risk for whale-ship collisions have any measures in place to protect whales from this threat. These measures include speed reductions, both mandatory and voluntary, for ships crossing waters that overlap with whale migration or feeding areas. 'As much as we found cause for concern, we also found some big silver linings,' said Abrahms. 'For example, implementing management measures across only an additional 2.6% of the ocean’s surface would protect all of the highest-risk collision hotspots we identified.' 'Trade-offs between industrial and conservation outcomes are not usually this optimal,' said co-author Heather Welch, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of California, Santa Cruz. 'Oftentimes industrial activities must be greatly limited to achieve conservation goals, or vice versa. In this case, there is a potentially large conservation benefit to whales for not much cost to the shipping industry.' Those highest-risk areas for the four while species included in the study lie largely along coastal areas in the Mediterranean, portions of the Americas, southern Africa and parts of Asia. The international team behind the study, which includes researchers across five continents, looked at the waters where these four whale species live, feed and migrate by pooling data from disparate sources — including government surveys, sightings by members of the public, tagging studies and even whaling records. The team collected some 435,000 unique whale sightings. They then combined this novel database with information on the courses of 176,000 cargo vessels from 2017 to 2022 — tracked by each ship’s automatic identification system and processed using an algorithm from Global Fishing Watch — to identify where whales and ships are most likely to meet. The study uncovered regions already known to be high-risk areas for ship strikes: North America’s Pacific coast, Panama, the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. But it also identified understudied regions at high risk for whale-ship collisions, including southern Africa; South America along the coasts of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Ecuador; the Azores; and East Asia off the coasts of China, Japan and South Korea. The team found that mandatory measures to reduce whale-ship collisions were very rare, overlapping just 0.54% of blue whale hotspots and 0.27% of humpback hotspots, and not overlapping any fin or sperm whale hotspots. Though many collision hotspots fell within marine protected areas, these preserves often lack speed limits for vessels, as they were largely established to curb fishing and industrial pollution. For all four species the vast majority of hotpots for whale-ship strikes — more than 95% — hugged coastlines, falling within a nation’s exclusive economic zone. That means that each country could implement its own protection measures in coordination with the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization. 'From the standpoint of conservation, the fact that most high-risk areas lie within exclusive economic zones is actually encouraging,' said Nisi. 'It means individual countries have the ability to protect the riskiest areas.' Of the limited measures now in place, most are along the Pacific coast of North America and in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to speed reduction, other options to reduce whale-ship strikes include changing vessel routings away from where whales are located, or creating alert systems to notify authorities and mariners when whales are nearby. 'Lowering vessel speed in hotspots also carries additional benefits, such as reducing underwater noise pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting air pollution, which helps people living in coastal areas,' said Nisi. The authors hope their global study could spur local or regional research to map out the hotspot zones in finer detail, inform advocacy efforts and consider the impact of climate change, which will change both whale and ship distributions as sea ice melts and ecosystems shift. 'Protecting whales from the impact of ship strikes is a huge global challenge. We’ve seen the benefits of slowing ships down at local scales through programs like ‘Blue Whales Blue Skies’ in California. Scaling up such programs will require a concerted effort by conservation organizations, governments and shipping companies,' said co-author Jono Wilson, director of ocean science at the California Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, which helped identify the need for this study and secured its funding. 'Whales play a critical role in marine ecosystems. Through this study we have measurable insights into ship-collision hotspots and risk and where we need to focus to make the most impact.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfeZg0OiUJ8lQcUS7HS2lRa	2024-11-21T15:15:31-08:00	
Bye-Bye Microplastics: New Plastic Is Recyclable And Fully Ocean-...	Researchers led by Takuzo Aida at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) have developed a new durable plastic that won’t pollute our oceans. The new material is as strong as conventional plastics and biodegradable, but what makes it special is that it breaks down in seawater. The new plastic is therefore expected to help reduce harmful microplastic pollution that accumulates in oceans and soil and eventually enters the food chain. The experimental findings were published in Science. Scientists have been trying to develop safe and sustainable materials that can replace traditional plastics, which are non-sustainable and harm the environment. While some recyclable and biodegradable plastics exist, one big problem remains. Current biodegradable plastics like PLA often find their way into the ocean where they cannot be degraded because they are water insoluble. As a result, microplastics—plastic bits smaller than 5 mm—are harming aquatic life and finding their way into the food chain, including our own bodies. In their new study, Aida and his team focused on solving this problem with supramolecular plastics—polymers with structures held together by reversible interactions. The new plastics were made by combining two ionic monomers that form cross-linked salt bridges, which provide strength and flexibility. In the initial tests, one of the monomers was a common food additive called sodium hexametaphosphate and the other was any of several guanidinium ion-based monomers. Both monomers can be metabolized by bacteria, ensuring biodegradability once the plastic is dissolved into its components. 'While the reversable nature of the bonds in supramolecular plastics have been thought to make them weak and unstable,' says Aida, 'our new materials are just the opposite.' In the new material, the salt bridges structure is irreversible unless exposed to electrolytes like those found in seawater. The key discovery was how to create these selectively irreversible cross links. As with oil with water, after mixing the two monomers together in water, the researchers observed two separated liquids. One was thick and viscous and contained the important structural cross linked salt bridges, while the other was watery and contained salt ions. For example, when sodium hexametaphosphate and alkyl diguanidinium sulfate were used, sodium sulphate salt was expelled into the watery layer. The final plastic, alkyl SP₂, was made by drying what remained in the thick viscous liquid layer. The 'desalting' turned out to be the critical step; without it, the resulting dried material was a brittle crystal, unfit for use. Resalting the plastic by placing it in salt water caused the interactions to reverse and the plastic’s structure destabilized in a matter of hours. Thus, having created a strong and durable plastic that can still be dissolved under certain conditions, the researchers next tested the plastic’s quality. The new plastics are non-toxic and non-flammable—meaning no CO2 emissions—and can be reshaped at temperatures above 120°C like other thermoplastics. By testing different types of guanidinium sulfates, the team was able to generate plastics that had varying hardnesses and tensile strengths, all comparable or better than conventional plastics. This means that the new type of plastic can be customized for need; hard scratch resistant plastics, rubber silicone-like plastics, strong weight-bearing plastics, or low tensile flexible plastics are all possible. The researchers also created ocean-degradable plastics using polysaccharides that form cross-linked salt bridges with guanidinium monomers. Plastics like these can be used in 3D printing as well as medical or health-related applications. Lastly, the researchers investigated the new plastic’s recyclability and biodegradability. After dissolving the initial new plastic in salt water, they were able to recover 91% of the hexametaphosphate and 82% of the guanidinium as powders, indicating that recycling is easy and efficient. In soil, sheets of the new plastic degraded completely over the course of 10 days, supplying the soil with phosphorous and nitrogen similar to a fertilizer. 'With this new material, we have created a new family of plastics that are strong, stable, recyclable, can serve multiple functions, and importantly, do not generate microplastics,' says Aida.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MmdfIEfsRign	2024-11-21T15:13:35-08:00	
Quantum-Inspired Design Boosts Efficiency Of Heat-To-Electricity ...	Researchers at Rice University have found a new way to improve a key element of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems, which convert heat into electricity via light. Using an unconventional approach inspired by quantum physics, Rice engineer Gururaj Naik and his team designed a thermal emitter that can deliver high efficiencies within practical design parameters.The research could inform the development of thermal-energy electrical storage, which holds promise as an affordable, grid-scale alternative to batteries. More broadly, efficient TPV technologies could facilitate renewable energy growth ⎯ an essential component of the transition to a net-zero world. Another major benefit of better TPV systems is recouping waste heat from industrial processes, making them more sustainable. To put this in context, up to 20-50% of the heat used to transform raw materials into consumer goods ends up being wasted, costing the United States economy over $200 billion annually.TPV systems involve two main components ⎯ photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert light into electricity and thermal emitters that turn heat into light. Both of these components have to work well in order for the system to be efficient, but efforts to optimize them have focused more on the PV cell. 'Using conventional design approaches limits thermal emitters’ design space, and what you end up with is one of two scenarios: practical, low-performance devices or high-performance emitters that are hard to integrate in real-world applications,' said Naik, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. In a new study published in npj Nanophotonics, Naik and his former Ph.D. student Ciril Samuel Prasad ⎯ who has since earned a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering from Rice and has taken on a role as a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ⎯ demonstrated a new thermal emitter that promises efficiencies of over 60% despite being application-ready. 'We essentially showed how to achieve the best possible performance for the emitter given realistic, practical design constraints,' said Prasad, who is the first author on the study.The emitter is composed of a tungsten metal sheet, a thin layer of a spacer material and a network of silicon nanocylinders. When heated, the base layers accumulate thermal radiation, which can be thought of as a bath of photons. The tiny resonators sitting on top 'talk' to each other in a way that allows them to 'pluck photon by photon' from this bath, controlling the brightness and bandwidth of the light sent to the PV cell.'Instead of focusing on the performance of single-resonator systems, we instead took into account the way these resonators interact, which opened up new possibilities,' Naik explained. 'This gave us control over how the photons are stored and released.' This selective emission, achieved through insights from quantum physics, maximizes energy conversion and allows for higher efficiencies than previously possible, operating at the limit of the materials’ properties. To improve on the newly achieved 60% efficiency, new materials with better properties would need to be developed or discovered.These gains could make TPV a competitive alternative to other energy storage and conversion technologies like lithium-ion batteries, particularly in scenarios where long-term energy storage is needed. Naik noted that this innovation has significant implications for industries that generate large amounts of waste heat such as nuclear power plants and manufacturing facilities.'I feel confident that what we have demonstrated here, coupled with a very efficient low bandgap PV cell, has very promising potential,' Naik said. 'Based on my own experience working with NASA and launching a startup in the renewable energy space, I think that energy conversion technologies are very much in need today.'The team’s technology could also be used in space applications such as powering rovers on Mars.'If our approach could lead to an increase in efficiency from 2% to 5% in such systems, that would represent a significant boost for missions that rely on efficient power generation in extreme environments,' Naik said.The research was supported by the National Science Foundation (1935446) and the U.S. Army Research Office.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcKFETmBYN1MuroTh7y1vLy	2024-11-21T15:11:27-08:00	
Exploring The Impact Of Offshore Wind On Whale Deaths	In the winter of 2022-2023, nearly a dozen whales died off the coast of New Jersey, near the sites of several proposed wind farms. Their deaths prompted concern that related survey work being conducted in the area somehow contributed to their deaths. In pursuit of clean energy goals and to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions, developers are increasingly exploring building wind turbines in the waters off the East Coast of the United States. Three offshore wind farms are already in operation, with several more planned or underway. These wind farms stand to generate a significant amount of carbon-free electricity, which can help coastal states meet their decarbonization goals. The increased presence of these turbines in coastal waters, along with the noise from construction and surveys, has led to concerns of their impact on marine life. In particular, cetaceans such as whales and dolphins are likely to be sensitive to the noises and increased marine traffic brought by these turbines. However, the Marine Mammal Commission, a federal oversight agency, states there is no evidence linking the whales that died in the New Jersey region in the winter of 2022-2023 to wind energy development. According to necropsies performed on recovered whales, many of them died from collisions with ships. The Marine Mammal Commission notes that this is not a particularly unusual occurrence, nor is the number of whale deaths in this period higher than average. A rise in ship strikes over the last decade is mostly due to a simple combination of more whales plus more ships. 'In the case of a lot of whales, population recoveries since the cessation of commercial whaling are coincident with increasing shipping traffic and increasing fishing efforts,' said Stocker. 'This is resulting in increased interactions between whales and the industrialization of the ocean.' Stocker, however, is concerned that the increased presence of survey ships in and around New Jersey waters may have exacerbated this issue. 'Were the ship strikes just a coincidence?' asked Stocker. 'Or were they a product of compromised whale vigilance due to aggregated stress factors?' Survey ships are employed by wind farm developers to map the seafloor in preparation for construction. These ships use underwater acoustic devices in their efforts, which can stress marine mammals such as whales. While one survey ship likely has little effect, Stocker highlights that 11 different surveys were operating in the region from December 2022 to March 2023, and that the cumulative impact of these surveys has not been properly evaluated. Stocker hopes his session will spark a discussion among attendees with the goal of identifying approaches to minimize whale deaths in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeEK_t_OqF2dsQ36glFESvq	2024-11-21T15:09:31-08:00	
Astronomers Take The First Close-Up Picture Of A Star Outside Our...	For the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star in a galaxy outside our own Milky Way,' says Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist from Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile. Located a staggering 160 000 light-years from us, the star WOH G64 was imaged thanks to the impressive sharpness offered by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope Interferometer (ESO’s VLTI). The new observations reveal a star puffing out gas and dust, in the last stages before it becomes a supernova. 'We discovered an egg-shaped cocoon closely surrounding the star,' says Ohnaka, the lead author of a study reporting the observations published today in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 'We are excited because this may be related to the drastic ejection of material from the dying star before a supernova explosion.' While astronomers have taken about two dozen zoomed-in images of stars in our galaxy, unveiling their properties, countless other stars dwell within other galaxies, so far away that observing even one of them in detail has been extremely challenging. Up until now. The newly imaged star, WOH G64, lies within the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the small galaxies that orbits the Milky Way. Astronomers have known about this star for decades and have appropriately dubbed it the ‘behemoth star’. With a size roughly 2000 times that of our Sun, WOH G64 is classified as a red supergiant. Ohnaka’s team had long been interested in this behemoth star. Back in 2005 and 2007, they used ESO’s VLTI in Chile’s Atacama Desert to learn more about the star’s features, and carried on studying it in the years since. But an actual image of the star had remained elusive. For the desired picture, the team had to wait for the development of one of the VLTI’s second-generation instruments, GRAVITY. After comparing their new results with other previous observations of WOH G64, they were surprised to find that the star had become dimmer over the past decade. 'We have found that the star has been experiencing a significant change in the last 10 years, providing us with a rare opportunity to witness a star’s life in real time,' says Gerd Weigelt, an astronomy professor at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany and a co-author of the study. In their final life stages, red supergiants like WOH G64 shed their outer layers of gas and dust in a process that can last thousands of years. 'This star is one of the most extreme of its kind, and any drastic change may bring it closer to an explosive end,' adds co-author Jacco van Loon, Keele Observatory Director at Keele University, UK, who has been observing WOH G64 since the 1990s. The team thinks that these shed materials may also be responsible for the dimming and for the unexpected shape of the dust cocoon around the star. The new image shows that the cocoon is stretched-out, which surprised scientists, who expected a different shape based on previous observations and computer models. The team believes that the cocoon’s egg-like shape could be explained by either the star’s shedding or by the influence of a yet-undiscovered companion star. As the star becomes fainter, taking other close-up pictures of it is becoming increasingly difficult, even for the VLTI. Nonetheless, planned updates to the telescope’s instrumentation, such as the future GRAVITY+, promise to change this soon. 'Similar follow-up observations with ESO instruments will be important for understanding what is going on in the star,' concludes Ohnaka.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXKJpqYMBg15l	2024-11-21T15:07:18-08:00	
Research Highlights The Pressures Human Activities Place On Tropi...	The tropical coastlines of Southeast Asia are home to some of the most important and biodiverse marine ecosystems on the planet. However, they are also among its most vulnerable, with areas of coral reefs, mangrove forests and seagrass beds under increasing threat from a wide range of human activities. To try and better understand those potential threats, a study by an international team of researchers has provided the first detailed assessment of activities taking place within coastal and marine habitats and the impact they have on those ecosystems. The research focused on case study sites in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, including marine protected areas in UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Reserves as well as a Marine Park. Of the 26 activities that were examined, it found that particular fishing techniques – and tourism and recreation – posed the greatest threat to the ecosystems. The fishing practices, including trawling and the use of gill and seine nets, were shown to cause physical pressures such as abrasion, smothering, siltation and total habitat loss. Meanwhile tourism activities resulted in different pressures such as organic enrichment, litter and pollution, in particular affecting coral reef habitats. With fishing and tourism being critical to the region’s economy, the researchers hope that highlighting their potential to impact specific locations could help ensure they can be conducted in a more sustainable manner in the future. The study, published in the British Ecological Society’s Journal of Applied Ecology, was led by researchers from the University of Plymouth together and involved colleagues from across Southeast Asia. It was carried out as part of Blue Communities, a £6.7million programme funded through the UK Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) in partnership with UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Dr Fiona Culhane, who carried out the research as part of a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Plymouth, and is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Marine Institute in Ireland, is the study’s lead author. She said: 'These sites are globally significant for their high marine biodiversity, but are at high risk of pressures from human activities. This work, carried out in collaboration with local communities and in-country researchers, has demonstrated that different locations experience different risks, according to the level of human activities in the sea. By better understanding how human activities are impacting various marine habitats, and the ecosystem services they provide, we can provide local stakeholders and marine managers with clearer evidence that they can use to inform future action.' Professor Melanie Austen, Professor of Ocean and Society at the University of Plymouth and lead of the Blue Communities programme, added: 'This study is a powerful example of strong collaboration between researchers from the Global South and Global North. Its aim, and that of the entire programme, has been to provide much needed analysis and information to help coastal communities live within the environmental limits of the natural marine resources.' In addition to forms of fishing and tourism, the research explored the importance and impact of activities including waste disposal, sand mining, aquaculture, coastal infrastructure development, and antique exploration. It then mapped whether, and to what extent, each activity caused forms of disruption including light, noise and water pollution, as well as physical damage to the coastline and seabed and the habitats they contained. Across the different countries, there was variation in the activities posing the greatest pressures with, for example, high risk coming from seine nets in Vietnam, fish farming in Malaysia and pots, traps and barricades in the Philippines. There were also differences across the main habitat types, with trawling and blast finishing among the activities posing the greatest risk to coral reefs, while shrimp farming placed the greatest pressure on mangroves, and trawling and tourism introduced the highest risk to seagrass. Dr Amy Y. Then, Associate Professor in the Institute of Biological Sciences at the Universiti Malaya in Malaysia, said: 'Findings from this paper challenge the way we think about spatially managing multiple economic activities and their impacts on vital coastal ecosystems. By identifying interactions between these activities and the habitats where they take place, we are able to make better marine spatial management decisions to ensure sustainability and resilience of these socio-ecological systems and their functioning.' Dr Radisti Praptiwi, researcher at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia, added 'This is an important study, especially in the context of data poor regions such as Indonesia. Research on understanding the impact chains linking activities and pressures to the marine environment can not only help identify the types of activities and habitats to be prioritised for management purposes, but also highlights areas for further research required for evidence-based policymaking.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJltVo-hmXXLwW2N6rpCd5	2024-11-21T15:04:50-08:00
